              group-coated surface is disclosed. The salt and polyalkylene
              glycol concentration of the solution is adjusted to levels which
              result in polynucleotide binding to the magnetic microparticles.
              The magnetic microparticles with bound polynucleotides are
              separated from the solution and the polynucleotides are eluted
              from the magnetic microparticles.",
