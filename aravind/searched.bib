  abstract = "The comparison of related genomes has emerged as a powerful lens
              for genome interpretation. Here we report the sequencing and
              comparative analysis of 29 eutherian genomes. We confirm that at
              least 5.5\% of the human genome has undergone purifying
              selection, and locate constrained elements covering ∼4.2\% of the
              genome. We use evolutionary signatures and comparisons with
              experimental data sets to suggest candidate functions for ∼60\%
              of constrained bases. These elements reveal a small number of new
              coding exons, candidate stop codon readthrough events and over
              10,000 regions of overlapping synonymous constraint within
              protein-coding exons. We find 220 candidate RNA structural
              families, and nearly a million elements overlapping potential
              promoter, enhancer and insulator regions. We report specific
              amino acid residues that have undergone positive selection,
              280,000 non-coding elements exapted from mobile elements and more
              than 1,000 primate- and human-accelerated elements. Overlap with
