              are much larger across than within countries, and smaller between
              cryptocurrencies, highlighting the importance of capital controls
              for the movement of arbitrage capital. Price deviations across
              countries co-move and open up in times of large bitcoin
              appreciation. Countries with higher bitcoin premia over the US
              bitcoin price see widening arbitrage deviations when bitcoin
              appreciates. Finally, we decompose signed volume on each exchange
              into a common and an idiosyncratic component. The common
              component explains 80\% of bitcoin returns. The idiosyncratic
              components help explain arbitrage spreads between exchanges.",

  abstract = "This study applies a set of measures developed by Diebold and
              Yilmaz (2012, 2016) to examine connectedness via return and
              volatility spillovers across six large cryptocurrencies from
              August 7, 2015 to February 22, 2018. Regardless of the sign of
              returns, the results show that Litecoin and Bitcoin are at the
              centre of the connected network of returns. This finding implies
              that return shocks arising from these two cryptocurrencies have
              the most effect on other cryptocurrencies. Further analysis shows
              that connectedness via negative returns is largely stronger than
              via positive ones. Ripple and Ethereum are the top recipients of
              negative-return shocks, whereas Ethereum and Dash exhibit very
              weak connectedness via positive returns. Regarding volatility
              spillovers, Bitcoin is the most influential, followed by
              Litecoin; Dash exhibits a very weak connectedness, suggesting its
              utility for hedging and diversification opportunities in the
              cryptocurrency market. Taken together, results imply that the
              importance of each cryptocurrency in return and volatility
              connectedness is not necessarily related to its market size.
              Further analyses reveal that trading volume and global financial
              and uncertainty effects as well as the investment-substitution
              effect are determinants of net directional spillovers.
              Interestingly, higher gold prices and US uncertainty increase the
              net directional negative-return spillovers, whereas they do the
              opposite for net directional positive-return spillovers.
              Furthermore, gold prices exhibit a negative sign for net
              directional-volatility spillovers, whereas US uncertainty shows a
              positive sign. Economic actors interested in the cryptocurrency
              market can build on our findings when weighing their decisions.",
