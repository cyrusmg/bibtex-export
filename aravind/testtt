              genes. However, significantly larger sample sizes are needed to
              identify the complete set of genetic risk factors. We conducted a
              pilot study for SPARK (SPARKForAutism.org) of 457 families with

              addition, we identified variants that are possibly associated

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET) is an imaging
              technique used to generate three-dimensional structures of
              cellular macromolecule complexes in their native environment. Due
              to developing cryo-electron microscopy technology, the image
              quality of three-dimensional reconstruction of cryo-electron
              tomography has greatly improved. However, cryo-ET images are
              characterized by low resolution, partial data loss and low
              signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In order to tackle these challenges
              and improve resolution, a large number of subtomograms containing
              the same structure needs to be aligned and averaged. Existing
              methods for refining and aligning subtomograms are still highly
              time-consuming, requiring many computationally intensive
              processing steps (i.e. the rotations and translations of
              subtomograms in three-dimensional space). RESULTS: In this
              article, we propose a Stochastic Average Gradient (SAG)
              fine-grained alignment method for optimizing the sum of
              dissimilarity measure in real space. We introduce a Message
              Passing Interface (MPI) parallel programming model in order to
              explore further speedup. CONCLUSIONS: We compare our stochastic
              average gradient fine-grained alignment algorithm with two
              baseline methods, high-precision alignment and fast alignment.
              Our SAG fine-grained alignment algorithm is much faster than the
              two baseline methods. Results on simulated data of GroEL from the
              Protein Data Bank (PDB ID:1KP8) showed that our parallel
              SAG-based fine-grained alignment method could achieve
              close-to-optimal rigid transformations with higher precision than
              both high-precision alignment and fast alignment at a low SNR
              (SNR=0.003) with tilt angle range $\pm$60∘ or $\pm$40∘. For the
              experimental subtomograms data structures of GroEL and
              GroEL/GroES complexes, our parallel SAG-based fine-grained
              alignment can achieve higher precision and fewer iterations to
              converge than the two baseline methods.",

  abstract = "We report an efficient method for detecting functional RNAs. The
              approach, which combines comparative sequence analysis and
              structure prediction, already has yielded excellent results for a
              small number of aligned sequences and is suitable for large-scale
              genomic screens. It consists of two basic components: (i) a
              measure for RNA secondary structure conservation based on
              computing a consensus secondary structure, and (ii) a measure for
              thermodynamic stability, which, in the spirit of a z score, is
              normalized with respect to both sequence length and base
              composition but can be calculated without sampling from shuffled
              sequences. Functional RNA secondary structures can be identified
              in multiple sequence alignments with high sensitivity and high
              specificity. We demonstrate that this approach is not only much
              more accurate than previous methods but also significantly
              faster. The method is implemented in the program rnaz, which can
              be downloaded from www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~wash/RNAz. We screened
              all alignments of length n > or = 50 in the Comparative
              Regulatory Genomics database, which compiles conserved noncoding
              elements in upstream regions of orthologous genes from human,
              mouse, rat, Fugu, and zebrafish. We recovered all of the known
              noncoding RNAs and cis-acting elements with high significance and

              stabilizes its interacting partner protein LRPPRC by protecting
              it from degradation. Although SLIRP is completely dependent on
              LRPPRC for its stability, reduced levels of LRPPRC persist in the
              absence of SLIRP in vivo. Surprisingly, Slirp knockout mice are
              apparently healthy and only display a minor weight loss, despite
              a 50-70\% reduction in the steady-state levels of mtDNA-encoded
              mRNAs. In contrast to LRPPRC, SLIRP is dispensable for
              polyadenylation of mtDNA-encoded mRNAs. Instead, deep RNA
              sequencing (RNAseq) of mitochondrial ribosomal fractions and
              additional molecular analyses show that SLIRP is required for
              proper association of mRNAs to the mitochondrial ribosome and
              efficient translation. Our findings thus establish distinct
              functions for SLIRP and LRPPRC within the LRPPRC-SLIRP complex,
              with a novel role for SLIRP in mitochondrial translation. Very
              surprisingly, our results also demonstrate that mammalian

  abstract = "RNA has a dual role as an informational molecule and a direct
              effector of biological tasks. The latter function is enabled by
              RNA's ability to adopt complex secondary and tertiary folds and
              thus has motivated extensive computational and experimental
              efforts for determining RNA structures. Existing approaches for
              evaluating RNA structure have been largely limited to in vitro
              systems, yet the thermodynamic forces which drive RNA folding in
              vitro may not be sufficient to predict stable RNA structures in
              vivo. Indeed, the presence of RNA-binding proteins and
              ATP-dependent helicases can influence which structures are
              present inside cells. Here we present an approach for globally
              monitoring RNA structure in native conditions in vivo with
              single-nucleotide precision. This method is based on in vivo
              modification with dimethyl sulphate (DMS), which reacts with
              unpaired adenine and cytosine residues, followed by deep
              sequencing to monitor modifications. Our data from yeast and
              mammalian cells are in excellent agreement with known messenger
              RNA structures and with the high-resolution crystal structure of
              the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosome. Comparison between in vivo
              and in vitro data reveals that in rapidly dividing cells there
              are vastly fewer structured mRNA regions in vivo than in vitro.
              Even thermostable RNA structures are often denatured in cells,
              highlighting the importance of cellular processes in regulating
              RNA structure. Indeed, analysis of mRNA structure under
              ATP-depleted conditions in yeast shows that energy-dependent
              processes strongly contribute to the predominantly unfolded state
              of mRNAs inside cells. Our studies broadly enable the functional
              analysis of physiological RNA structures and reveal that, in
              contrast to the Anfinsen view of protein folding whereby the
              structure formed is the most thermodynamically favourable,
              thermodynamics have an incomplete role in determining mRNA
              structure in vivo.",

              Canada testing hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis. We
              enrolled adults who had household or occupational exposure to
              someone with confirmed Covid-19 at a distance of less than 6 ft
              for more than 10 minutes while wearing neither a face mask nor an

              exposure, we randomly assigned participants to receive either
              placebo or hydroxychloroquine (800 mg once, followed by 600 mg in
              6 to 8 hours, then 600 mg daily for 4 additional days). The
              primary outcome was the incidence of either laboratory-confirmed
              Covid-19 or illness compatible with Covid-19 within 14 days.
              RESULTS: We enrolled 821 asymptomatic participants. Overall,
              87.6\% of the participants (719 of 821) reported a high-risk
              exposure to a confirmed Covid-19 contact. The incidence of new

              barriers to clinical and academic productivity, research success,
              and work-life balance. We sought to determine if the Eastern
              Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) Mentoring Program
              has met its goals of fostering academic and personal growth in
              young acute care surgeons. METHODS: We conducted a systematic
              program evaluation of EAST Mentoring Program's first 4 years.
              Demographic information was collected from EAST records,
              mentorship program applications, and mentee-mentor career
              development plans. We reviewed the career development plans for
              thematic commonalities and results of a structured, online
              questionnaire distributed since program inception. A mixed
              methods approach was used to better understand the program goals
              from both mentee and mentor perspectives, as well as attitudes
              and barriers regarding the perceived success of this career
              development program. RESULTS: During 2012 to 2015, 65 mentoring
              dyads were paired and 60 completed the program. Of 184 surveys
              distributed, 108 were returned (57\% response rate). Respondents
              were evenly distributed between mentees and mentors (53 vs. 55, p
              = 0.768). In participant surveys, mentoring relationships were
              viewed to focus on research (45\%), ``sticky situations'' (e.g.,
              communication, work-life balance) (27\%), education (18\%), or
              administrative issues (10\%). Mentees were more focused on
              research and education versus mentors (74\% vs. 50\%; p = 0.040).
              Mentees felt that goals were ``always'' or ``usually'' met versus
              mentors (89\% vs. 77\%; p = 0.096). Two barriers to successful
              mentorship included time and communication, with most pairs
              communicating by email. Most respondents (91\%) planned to
              continue the relationship beyond the EAST Mentoring Program and
              recommended the experience to colleagues. CONCLUSION: Mentee
              satisfaction with the EAST Mentoring Program was high. Mentoring
              is a beneficial tool to promote success among EAST's young
              members, but differences exist between mentee and mentor
              perceptions. Revising communication expectations and time
              commitment to improve career development may help our young acute
              care surgeons.",

               interest to them. Numerous collaborative filtering (CF)
               approaches have been proposed in the literature to address this
               information overload problem. However, with increasingly large
               datasets, it is often not possible to experiment with every
               approach and choose the one that best fits an application
               domain. In this work, we study two CF algorithms, Adsorption and
               Matrix Factorization, considered to be state-of-the-art
               approaches, and summarize our experiences and lessons learned
               from experiments on three implicit feedback data domains.
               Specifically, we suggest that the characteristics of a domain
               (e.g., Close connections versus loose connections among users)
               or characteristics of the data available (e.g., Density of the
               feedback matrix) can be useful in selecting the most suitable CF
               approach to use for a particular recommendation problem.
               Furthermore, we suggest that similar information can also be
               useful in selecting the best approach to constructing user
               neighborhoods for Adsorption. Finally, for domains with time
               information, we show that short user histories can be more

  abstract = "Results are presented from searches for the standard model Higgs
              boson in proton--proton collisions at s=7 and 8 TeV in the
              Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the LHC, using data samples
              corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 fb−1 at 7
              TeV and 5.3 fb−1 at 8 TeV. The search is performed in five decay
              modes: $\gamma$$\gamma$, ZZ, W+W−, $\tau$+$\tau$−, and
              bb\textasciimacron{}. An excess of events is observed above the
              expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard
              deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of
              a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model
              Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess
              is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass
              resolution, $\gamma$$\gamma$ and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives
              a mass of 125.3$\pm$0.4(stat.)$\pm$0.5(syst.) GeV. The decay to
              two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin
              different from one.",
