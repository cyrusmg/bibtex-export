              stabilizes its interacting partner protein LRPPRC by protecting
              it from degradation. Although SLIRP is completely dependent on
              LRPPRC for its stability, reduced levels of LRPPRC persist in the
              absence of SLIRP in vivo. Surprisingly, Slirp knockout mice are
              apparently healthy and only display a minor weight loss, despite
              a 50-70\% reduction in the steady-state levels of mtDNA-encoded
              mRNAs. In contrast to LRPPRC, SLIRP is dispensable for
              polyadenylation of mtDNA-encoded mRNAs. Instead, deep RNA
              sequencing (RNAseq) of mitochondrial ribosomal fractions and
              additional molecular analyses show that SLIRP is required for
              proper association of mRNAs to the mitochondrial ribosome and
              efficient translation. Our findings thus establish distinct
              functions for SLIRP and LRPPRC within the LRPPRC-SLIRP complex,
              with a novel role for SLIRP in mitochondrial translation. Very
              surprisingly, our results also demonstrate that mammalian
