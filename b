  abstract = "Multicellular organisms appeared on Earth through several
              independent major evolutionary transitions. Are such transitions
              reversible? Addressing this fundamental question entails
              understanding the benefits and costs of multicellularity versus
              unicellularity. For example, some wild yeast strains form
              multicellular clumps, which might be beneficial in stressful
              conditions, but this has been untested. Here, we show that
              unicellular yeast evolve from clump-forming ancestors by
              propagating samples from suspension after larger clumps have
              settled. Unicellular yeast strains differed from their clumping
              ancestors mainly by mutations in the AMN1 (Antagonist of Mitotic
              exit Network) gene. Ancestral yeast clumps were more resistant to
              freeze/thaw, hydrogen peroxide, and ethanol stressors than their
              unicellular counterparts, but they grew slower without stress.
              These findings suggest disadvantages and benefits to
              multicellularity and unicellularity that may have impacted the
              emergence of multicellular life forms.",

              modification of the viral capsid. AAV capsid variants possess
              unique antigenic profiles and demonstrate distinct cellular

              can be chemically modified to alter tropism, can be produced as
              hybrid vectors that combine the properties of multiple serotypes,
              and can carry peptide insertions that introduce novel
              receptor-binding activity. Furthermore, directed evolution of
              shuffled genome libraries can identify engineered variants with
              unique properties, and rational modification of the viral capsid

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Severe malaria is a major cause of childhood death
              and often the main reason for paediatric hospital admission in
              sub-Saharan Africa. Quinine is still the established treatment of
              choice, although evidence from Asia suggests that artesunate is
              associated with a lower mortality. We compared parenteral
              treatment with either artesunate or quinine in African children
              with severe malaria. METHODS: This open-label, randomised trial
              was undertaken in 11 centres in nine African countries. Children
              (<15 years) with severe falciparum malaria were randomly assigned
              to parenteral artesunate or parenteral quinine. Randomisation was
              in blocks of 20, with study numbers corresponding to treatment
              allocations kept inside opaque sealed paper envelopes. The trial
              was open label at each site, and none of the investigators or
              trialists, apart from for the trial statistician, had access to
              the summaries of treatment allocations. The primary outcome
              measure was in-hospital mortality, analysed by intention to
              treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN50258054. FINDINGS:
              5425 children were enrolled; 2712 were assigned to artesunate and
              2713 to quinine. All patients were analysed for the primary
              outcome. 230 (8·5\%) patients assigned to artesunate treatment
              died compared with 297 (10·9\%) assigned to quinine treatment
              (odds ratio [OR] stratified for study site 0·75, 95\% CI
              0·63-0·90; relative reduction 22·5\%, 95\% CI 8·1-36·9;
              p=0·0022). Incidence of neurological sequelae did not differ
              significantly between groups, but the development of coma
              (65/1832 [3·5\%] with artesunate vs 91/1768 [5·1\%] with quinine;
              OR 0·69 95\% CI 0·49-0·95; p=0·0231), convulsions (224/2712
              [8·3\%] vs 273/2713 [10·1\%]; OR 0·80, 0·66-0·97; p=0·0199), and
              deterioration of the coma score (166/2712 [6·1\%] vs 208/2713
              [7·7\%]; OR 0·78, 0·64-0·97; p=0·0245) were all significantly
              less frequent in artesunate recipients than in quinine
              recipients. Post-treatment hypoglycaemia was also less frequent
              in patients assigned to artesunate than in those assigned to
              quinine (48/2712 [1·8\%] vs 75/2713 [2·8\%]; OR 0·63, 0·43-0·91;
              p=0·0134). Artesunate was well tolerated, with no serious
              drug-related adverse effects. INTERPRETATION: Artesunate
              substantially reduces mortality in African children with severe
              malaria. These data, together with a meta-analysis of all trials
              comparing artesunate and quinine, strongly suggest that
              parenteral artesunate should replace quinine as the treatment of
              choice for severe falciparum malaria worldwide. FUNDING: The

              If an infection results in lysogeny, the lysogen continues to
              grow and divide normally, seemingly unaffected by the integrated
              viral genome known as a prophage. However, the prophage can still
              have an impact on the host's phenotype and overall fitness in
              certain environments. Additionally, the prophage within the
              lysogen can activate the lytic pathway via spontaneous prophage
              induction (SPI), killing the lysogen and releasing new progeny
              phages. These new phages can then lyse or lysogenize other
              susceptible nonlysogens, thereby impacting the competition
              between lysogens and nonlysogens. In a scenario with differing
              growth rates, it is not clear whether SPI would be beneficial or
              detrimental to the lysogens since it kills the host cell but also
              attacks nonlysogenic competitors, either lysing or lysogenizing

              lysogens and nonlysogens and derive general conditions on SPI

              between network traits derived from task-free FC and

              Three main independent FC-traits were identified and linked to
              consciousness-related clinical features. The first one represents
              the functional configuration of a ``resting'' human brain, and it
              is associated to a sedative (sevoflurane), the overall effect of
              the pathology and the level of arousal. The second FC-trait
              reflects the disconnection of the visual and sensory-motor
              connectivity patterns. It also relates to the time since the
              insult and to the ability of communicating with the external
              environment. The third FC-trait isolates the connectivity pattern
              encompassing the fronto-parietal and the default-mode network
              areas as well as the interaction between left and right
              hemispheres, which are also associated to the awareness of the

              DRN Pet-1 neurons increase their firing activity during reward

              provide an adaptive cellular response against chronic

              genetically defined inhibitory interneuron classes, the

              targeting somatostatin (SOM) neurons in anterior cingulate cortex
              of mice performing a reward foraging task. Here we show that PV
              and a subtype of SOM neurons form functionally homogeneous
              populations showing a double dissociation between both their
              inhibitory effects and behavioural correlates. Out of several

              selectively responded at reward approach, whereas PV neurons
              responded at reward leaving and encoded preceding stay duration.
              These behavioural correlates of PV and SOM neurons defined a

              vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) mediates disinhibitory
              control in multiple areas of neocortex and is recruited by
              reinforcement signals. By combining optogenetic activation with

              of Alzheimer's disease. Optogenetically driving fast-spiking
              parvalbumin-positive (FS-PV)-interneurons at gamma (40 Hz), but
              not other frequencies, reduces levels of amyloid-$\beta$

              analysis confirmed increased microglia co-localization with

              light-flickering regime that reduced A$\beta$1-40 and
              A$\beta$1-42 levels in the visual cortex of pre-depositing mice
              and mitigated plaque load in aged, depositing mice. Our findings

              Alzheimer's-disease-associated pathology.",

              animal respond to various natural rewards. Here we addressed this
              question using fibre photometry and single-unit recording from
              serotonin (5-HT) neurons and GABA neurons in the DRN of behaving
              mice. Rewards including sucrose, food, sex and social interaction
              rapidly activate 5-HT neurons, but aversive stimuli including
              quinine and footshock do not. Both expected and unexpected
              rewards activate 5-HT neurons. After mice learn to wait for
              sucrose delivery, most 5-HT neurons fire tonically during waiting
              and then phasically on reward acquisition. Finally, GABA neurons
              are activated by aversive stimuli but inhibited when mice seek
              rewards. Thus, DRN 5-HT neurons positively encode a wide range of
              reward signals during anticipatory and consummatory phases of
              reward responses. Moreover, GABA neurons play a complementary

              diagnosed at an average age of 2.66 years and was clinically
              overt in 85\% of patients. Patients with clinical features were
              older (p = 0.001). Complaints were dominated by exercise
              intolerance (80\%), noticed at 5.33 years in average. Physical
              signs, observed at 6.75 years in average, were dominated by
              muscle weakness (62\%). Functional impairment was observed in
              64\% of patients, without any link with age (p = 0.255). Among 33
              patients, 7 improved. Creatine kinase (CK) and aspartate
              aminotransferase (AST) levels were higher with
              age.Electrophysiological abnormalities, diagnosed in average at
              6.5 years, were more frequent after the first decade (p =
              0.0005). Myogenic pattern was predominant (42\%). Nerve

              electrophysiological features. Higher protein intake was related
              to fewer complaints and physical anomalies. CONCLUSION:
              Neuromuscular investigation is warranted even in asymptomatic
              patients, as early as the diagnosis of GSDIII is suspected.
              Muscle involvement can be disabling even in children. Favorable

              intermediate-thickness melanomas (1.2 to 3.5 mm). The value of
              completion lymph-node dissection for patients with sentinel-node
              metastases is not clear. METHODS: In an international trial, we
              randomly assigned patients with sentinel-node metastases detected
              by means of standard pathological assessment or a multimarker
              molecular assay to immediate completion lymph-node dissection
              (dissection group) or nodal observation with ultrasonography
              (observation group). The primary end point was melanoma-specific
              survival. Secondary end points included disease-free survival and
              the cumulative rate of nonsentinel-node metastasis. RESULTS:
              Immediate completion lymph-node dissection was not associated
              with increased melanoma-specific survival among 1934 patients
              with data that could be evaluated in an intention-to-treat
              analysis or among 1755 patients in the per-protocol analysis. In
              the per-protocol analysis, the mean ($\pm$SE) 3-year rate of
              melanoma-specific survival was similar in the dissection group
              and the observation group (86$\pm$1.3\% and 86$\pm$1.2\%,
              respectively; P=0.42 by the log-rank test) at a median follow-up
              of 43 months. The rate of disease-free survival was slightly
              higher in the dissection group than in the observation group
              (68$\pm$1.7\% and 63$\pm$1.7\%, respectively; P=0.05 by the
              log-rank test) at 3 years, based on an increased rate of disease
              control in the regional nodes at 3 years (92$\pm$1.0\% vs.
              77$\pm$1.5\%; P<0.001 by the log-rank test); these results must
              be interpreted with caution. Nonsentinel-node metastases,
              identified in 11.5\% of the patients in the dissection group,
              were a strong, independent prognostic factor for recurrence
              (hazard ratio, 1.78; P=0.005). Lymphedema was observed in 24.1\%
              of the patients in the dissection group and in 6.3\% of those in

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients with recurrent World Health
              Organization (WHO) grade IV malignant glioma is dismal, and there
              is currently no effective therapy. We conducted a dose-finding
              and toxicity study in this population of patients, evaluating
              convection-enhanced, intratumoral delivery of the recombinant
              nonpathogenic polio-rhinovirus chimera (PVSRIPO). PVSRIPO
              recognizes the poliovirus receptor CD155, which is widely
              expressed in neoplastic cells of solid tumors and in major
              components of the tumor microenvironment. METHODS: We enrolled
              consecutive adult patients who had recurrent supratentorial WHO
              grade IV malignant glioma, confirmed on histopathological
              testing, with measurable disease (contrast-enhancing tumor of
              $\geq$1 cm and $\leq$5.5 cm in the greatest dimension). The study
              evaluated seven doses, ranging between 107 and 1010 50\%
              tissue-culture infectious doses (TCID50), first in a
              dose-escalation phase and then in a dose-expansion phase.
              RESULTS: From May 2012 through May 2017, a total of 61 patients
              were enrolled and received a dose of PVSRIPO. Dose level -1
              (5.0$\times$107 TCID50) was identified as the phase 2 dose. One
              dose-limiting toxic effect was observed; a patient in whom dose
              level 5 (1010 TCID50) was administered had a grade 4 intracranial
              hemorrhage immediately after the catheter was removed. To
              mitigate locoregional inflammation of the infused tumor with
              prolonged glucocorticoid use, dose level 5 was deescalated to
              reach the phase 2 dose. In the dose-expansion phase, 19\% of the
              patients had a PVSRIPO-related adverse event of grade 3 or
              higher. Overall survival among the patients who received PVSRIPO
              reached a plateau of 21\% (95\% confidence interval, 11 to 33) at
              24 months that was sustained at 36 months. CONCLUSIONS:
              Intratumoral infusion of PVSRIPO in patients with recurrent WHO
              grade IV malignant glioma confirmed the absence of neurovirulent
              potential. The survival rate among patients who received PVSRIPO
              immunotherapy was higher at 24 and 36 months than the rate among
              historical controls. (Funded by the Brain Tumor Research Charity

              haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells to test if the population
              can restore lost PF function. In previous evolution experiments,
              mutations in a gene eliminated the fitness costs of PF
              activation. Since PF activation also provides drug resistance,
              exposing such compromised or broken mutants to both drug and
              inducer should create selection pressure to regain drug
              resistance and possibly PF function. Indeed, evolving 7 PF mutant
              strains in the presence of drug revealed 3 adaptation scenarios

              promote flexible adaptation to changes in the causal structure of
              the environment. This stems from two functions of endogenous
              serotonin activation: inhibiting learned responses that are not
              currently adaptive and driving plasticity to reconfigure them.
              These mirror dual functions of dopamine in invigorating
              reward-related responses and promoting plasticity that reinforces
              new ones. However, while dopamine neurons are known to be
              activated by reward prediction errors, consistent with theories
              of reinforcement learning, the reported firing patterns of
              serotonin neurons do not accord with any existing theories. Here,
              we used long-term photometric recordings in mice to study a

              Furthermore, by comparing cue responses of serotonin and dopamine

  abstract = "Transcription of bacterial genes is controlled by the coordinated
              action of cis- and trans-acting regulators. The activity and mode
              of action of these regulators can reflect different requirements
              for gene products in different environments. A well-studied
              example is the regulatory function that integrates the
              environmental availability of glucose and lactose to control the
              Escherichia colilac operon. Most studies of lac operon regulation
              have focused on a few closely related strains. To determine the
              range of natural variation in lac regulatory function, we
              introduced a reporter construct into 23 diverse E. coli strains
              and measured expression with combinations of inducer
              concentrations. We found a wide range of regulatory functions.
              Several functions were similar to the one observed in a reference
              lab strain, whereas others depended weakly on the presence of
              cAMP. Some characteristics of the regulatory function were
              explained by the genetic relatedness of strains, indicating that
              differences varied on relatively short time scales. The
              regulatory characteristics explained by genetic relatedness were
              among those that best predicted the initial growth of strains
              following transition to a lactose environment, suggesting a role
              for selection. Finally, we transferred the lac operon, with the
              lacI regulatory gene, from five natural isolate strains into a
              reference lab strain. The regulatory function of these hybrid
              strains revealed the effect of local and global regulatory
              elements in controlling expression. Together, this work
              demonstrates that regulatory functions can be varied within a
              species and that there is variation within a species to best
              match a function to particular environments.IMPORTANCE The lac
              operon of Escherichia coli is a classic model for studying gene
              regulation. This study has uncovered features such as the
              environmental input logic controlling gene expression, as well as
              gene expression bistability and hysteresis. Most lac operon
              studies have focused on a few lab strains, and it is not known
              how generally those findings apply to the diversity of E. coli
              strains. We examined the environmental dependence of lac gene
              regulation in 20 natural isolates of E. coli and found a wide
              range of regulatory responses. By transferring lac genes from
              natural isolate strains into a common reference strain, we found
              that regulation depends on both the lac genes themselves and on
              the broader genetic background, indicating potential for
              still-greater regulatory diversity following horizontal gene
              transfer. Our results reveal that there is substantial natural
              variation in the regulation of the lac operon and indicate that
              this variation can be ecologically meaningful.",

              prefrontal cortex (PFCx) in different wake-sleep states of adult
              rats. Using stereotypical spike time correlations, we identified
              a large (roughly 70\%) subset of BF neurons, which we named BF
              tonic neurons (BFTNs). BFTNs fired tonically at 2-8 Hz without
              significantly changing their average firing rate across
              wake-sleep states. As such, these cannot be classified as
              cholinergic neurons. BFTNs substantially increased the spiking
              variability during waking and rapid-eye-movement sleep, by
              exhibiting frequent spike bursts with <50-ms interspike interval.
              Spike bursts among BFTNs were highly correlated, leading to
              transient population synchronization events of BFTN ensembles
              that lasted on average 160 ms. Most importantly, BFTN
              synchronization occurred preferentially just before the troughs

              activity. Furthermore, BFTN synchronization was accompanied by
              transient increases in prefrontal cortex gamma oscillations.
              These results suggest that synchronization of BFTN ensembles,
              which are likely to be formed by cortical-projecting GABAergic
              neurons from the BF, could be primarily responsible for fast

              expected magnitude of thrombotic event reduction mediated by
              targeting FXI is unclear. Methods- We analyzed the association of
              2 common genetic variants, which alter levels of FXI, with a
              range of human phenotypes. We combined variants into a genetic
              score standardized to a 30\% increase in relative activated
              partial thromboplastin time, equivalent to what can be achieved
              with pharmacological FXI reduction. Using data from 371 695
              participants in the United Kingdom Biobank and 2 large-scale
              genome-wide association studies, we examined the effect of this
              FXI score on thrombotic and bleeding end points. Results- Genetic
              disposition to lower FXI levels was associated with reduced risks
              of venous thrombosis (odds ratio, 95\% CI; P value; odds
              ratio=0.1, 0.07-0.14; P=3$\times$10-43) and ischemic stroke (odds
              ratio=0.47, 0.36-0.61; P=2$\times$10-8) but not with major
              bleeding (odds ratio=0.7, 0.45-1.04; P=0.0739). The observed
              relative risk reductions were consistent within a range of
              subgroups that were at high risk for thrombosis. Consistently, we
              observed higher absolute risk reductions conferred by genetically
              lower FXI levels in high-risk subgroups, such as patients with
              atrial fibrillation. Conclusions- Human genetic data suggest that
              pharmacological inhibition of FXI may achieve considerable
              reductions in ischemic stroke risk without clear evidence for an
              associated risk of major bleeding. The quantitative framework

              progressive liver cirrhosis and failure leading to either liver
              transplantation or death by 5 yr of age. However, the liver

              R515C, F257L, and R524X. Transient expression experiments showed

              mutations, L224P and Y329S, were detected in two separate alleles

              This deletion, representing the loss of one full exon, was caused
              by a 3' acceptor splicing site mutation (ag to aa). The deletion
              abolished GBE activity. Our studies indicate that the three
              different forms of GSD-IV were caused by mutations in the same
              GBE gene. The data also suggest that the significant retention of
              GBE activity in the Y329S allele may be a reason for the mild

              alleles in all three patients involved mutations in exon 3 at

              change of subsequent amino acid sequence and a truncated protein

              17delAG mutation was also found in 8 of the 10 additional

              W68OX. The R864X and R1228X were not unique for GSD-IIIb as they
              were also found in GSD-IIIa patients (frequency of 10.3\% and
              5.2\% in Caucasian patients, respectively). Our data demonstrated
              that both IIIa and IIIb had mutations in the same GDE gene and

              exocrine pancreas, myocardial epicytes, interstitial cells, and
              gastric parietal cells. No differences in lesion severity or
              distribution were detected between animals dosed with swainsonine
              and those dosed with locoweed. Rats dosed with castanospermine
              were clinically normal; however, they developed mild vacuolation
              of the renal tubular epithelium, the thyroid follicular
              epithelium, hepatocytes, and skeletal myocytes. Special stains
              and lectin histochemical evaluation showed that swainsonine- and
              castanospermine-induced vacuoles contained mannose-rich
              oligosaccharides. Castanospermine-induced vacuoles also contained
              glycogen. These results suggest that 1) swainsonine causes
              lesions similar to those caused by locoweed and is probably the
              primary locoweed toxin; 2) castanospermine at high doses causes
              vacuolar changes in the kidney and thyroid gland; and 3)
              castanospermine intoxication results in degenerative vacuolation
              of hepatocytes and skeletal myocytes, similar to genetic
              glycogenosis.",

  author   = "Avila, Irene and Lin, Shih-Chieh",
  abstract = "The survival of animals depends critically on prioritizing
              responses to motivationally salient stimuli. While it is
              generally believed that motivational salience increases decision
              speed, the quantitative relationship between motivational
              salience and decision speed, measured by reaction time (RT),
              remains unclear. Here we show that the neural correlate of
              motivational salience in the basal forebrain (BF), defined
              independently of RT, is coupled with faster and also more precise
              decision speed. In rats performing a reward-biased simple RT
              task, motivational salience was encoded by BF bursting response
              that occurred before RT. We found that faster RTs were tightly
              coupled with stronger BF motivational salience signals.
              Furthermore, the fraction of RT variability reflecting the
              contribution of intrinsic noise in the decision-making process
              was actively suppressed in faster RT distributions with stronger
              BF motivational salience signals. Artificially augmenting the BF
              motivational salience signal via electrical stimulation led to
              faster and more precise RTs and supports a causal relationship.
              Together, these results not only describe for the first time, to
              our knowledge, the quantitative relationship between motivational
              salience and faster decision speed, they also reveal the
              quantitative coupling relationship between motivational salience
              and more precise RT. Our results further establish the existence
              of an early and previously unrecognized step in the
              decision-making process that determines both the RT speed and
              variability of the entire decision-making process and suggest
              that this novel decision step is dictated largely by the BF
              motivational salience signal. Finally, our study raises the
              hypothesis that the dysregulation of decision speed in conditions
              such as depression, schizophrenia, and cognitive aging may result
              from the functional impairment of the motivational salience
              signal encoded by the poorly understood noncholinergic BF

  abstract = "Neural circuits are exquisitely organized, consisting of many
              different neuronal subpopulations. However, it is difficult to
              assess the functional roles of these subpopulations using
              conventional extracellular recording techniques because these
              techniques do not easily distinguish spikes from different
              neuronal populations. To overcome this limitation, we have
              developed PINP (Photostimulation-assisted Identification of
              Neuronal Populations), a method of tagging neuronal populations
              for identification during in vivo electrophysiological recording.
              The method is based on expressing the light-activated channel
              channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) to restricted neuronal subpopulations.
              ChR2-tagged neurons can be detected electrophysiologically in
              vivo since illumination of these neurons with a brief flash of
              blue light triggers a short latency reliable action potential. We
              demonstrate the feasibility of this technique by expressing ChR2
              in distinct populations of cortical neurons using two different
              strategies. First, we labeled a subpopulation of cortical
              neurons-mainly fast-spiking interneurons-by using
              adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver ChR2 in a transgenic
              mouse line in which the expression of Cre recombinase was driven
              by the parvalbumin promoter. Second, we labeled subpopulations of
              excitatory neurons in the rat auditory cortex with ChR2 based on
              projection target by using herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), which
              is efficiently taken up by axons and transported retrogradely; we
              find that this latter population responds to acoustic stimulation
              differently from unlabeled neurons. Tagging neurons is a novel
              application of ChR2, used in this case to monitor activity
              instead of manipulating it. PINP can be readily extended to other
              populations of genetically identifiable neurons, and will provide
              a useful method for probing the functional role of different
              neuronal populations in vivo.",

              circuit dynamics to behavior requires precise control of sensory
              stimuli and measurement of body movements. Head-fixation has been
              used for behavioral research, particularly in non-human primates,
              to facilitate precise stimulus control, behavioral monitoring and
              neural recording. However, choice-based, perceptual decision
              tasks by head-fixed mice have only recently been introduced.
              Training mice relies on motivating mice using water restriction.
              Here we describe procedures for head-fixation, water restriction
              and behavioral training for head-fixed mice, with a focus on
              active, whisker-based tactile behaviors. In these experiments
              mice had restricted access to water (typically 1 ml/day). After
              ten days of water restriction, body weight stabilized at
              approximately 80\% of initial weight. At that point mice were
              trained to discriminate sensory stimuli using operant
              conditioning. Head-fixed mice reported stimuli by licking in
              go/no-go tasks and also using a forced choice paradigm using a
              dual lickport. In some cases mice learned to discriminate sensory
              stimuli in a few trials within the first behavioral session.
              Delay epochs lasting a second or more were used to separate
              sensation (e.g. tactile exploration) and action (i.e. licking).
              Mice performed a variety of perceptual decision tasks with high
              performance for hundreds of trials per behavioral session. Up to
              four months of continuous water restriction showed no adverse
              health effects. Behavioral performance correlated with the degree
              of water restriction, supporting the importance of controlling
              access to water. These behavioral paradigms can be combined with
              cellular resolution imaging, random access photostimulation, and
              whole cell recordings.",

              Plasma haptoglobin and hemopexin scavenge free hemoglobin and
              heme, respectively, but can be depleted in hemolytic states.
              Haptoglobin and hemopexin supplementation protect tissues,
              including the vasculature, liver and kidneys. It is widely
              assumed that these protective effects are due primarily to
              hemoglobin and heme clearance from the vasculature. However, this
              simple assumption does not account for the consequent
              cytoprotective adaptation seen in cells and organs. To further
              address the mechanism, we used a hyperhemolytic murine model
              (Townes-SS) of sickle cell disease to examine cellular responses
              to haptoglobin and hemopexin supplementation. A single infusion
              of haptoglobin or hemopexin ($\pm$ equimolar hemoglobin) in
              SS-mice increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the liver, kidney
              and skin several fold within 1 hour and decreased nuclear NF-ĸB

              Plasma hemoglobin and heme levels were not significantly changed

              and hemopexin also inhibited hypoxia/reoxygenation and
              lipopolysaccharide-induced vaso-occlusion in SS-mice. Inhibition
              of HO-1 activity with tin protoporphyrin blocked the protections
              afforded by haptoglobin and hemopexin in SS-mice. The HO-1
              reaction product carbon monoxide, fully restored the protection,
              in part by inhibiting Weibel-Palade body mobilization of
              P-selectin and von Willebrand factor to endothelial cell
              surfaces. Thus, the mechanism by which haptoglobin and hemopexin

              analysis was employed to establish novel mechanisms of action of
              this drug. Organoid cell cultures were employed to identify
              possible antigens associated with the tumor and the patient's
              T-cells were expanded against one of these antigens. Similar and
              identical T-cell receptor sequences were observed in the initial
              biopsy and the expanded T-cell population. Immunotherapy
              treatment failed to shrink the tumor, which had undergone an
              epithelial to mesenchymal transition prior to therapy. A warm

  abstract = "Basal forebrain (BF) is one of the largest cortically-projecting
              neuromodulatory systems in the mammalian brain, and plays a key
              role in attention, arousal, learning and memory. The cortically
              projecting BF neurons, comprised of mainly magnocellular
              cholinergic and GABAergic neurons, are widely distributed across
              several brain regions that spatially overlap with the ventral
              striatopallidal system at the ventral pallidum (VP). As a first
              step toward untangling the respective functions of spatially
              overlapping BF and VP systems, the goal of this study was to
              comprehensively characterize the behavioral correlates and
              physiological properties of heterogeneous neuronal populations in
              the BF region. We found that, while rats performed a
              reward-biased simple reaction time task, distinct neuronal
              populations encode either motivational salience or movement
              information. The motivational salience of attended stimuli is
              encoded by phasic bursting activity of a large population of
              slow-firing neurons that have large, broad, and complex action
              potential waveforms. In contrast, two other separate groups of
              neurons encode movement-related information, and respectively
              increase and decrease firing rates while rats maintained
              fixation. These two groups of neurons mostly have higher firing
              rates and small, narrow action potential waveforms. These results
              support the conclusion that multiple neurophysiologically
              distinct neuronal populations in the BF region operate
              independently of each other as parallel functional circuits.
              These observations also caution against interpreting neuronal
              activity in this region as a homogeneous population reflecting
              the function of either BF or VP alone. We suggest that salience-
              and movement-related neuronal populations likely correspond to BF
              corticopetal neurons and VP neurons, respectively.",

              entire mouse brain. We used serial two-photon tomography to

              in c-fosGFP transgenic mice subjected to the learned helplessness
              (LH) procedure, a widely used model of stress-induced
              depression-like phenotype in laboratory animals. We found that
              mice showing ``helpless'' behavior had an overall brain-wide
              reduction in the level of neuronal activation compared with mice
              showing ``resilient'' behavior, with the exception of a few brain
              areas, including the locus coeruleus, that were more activated in

              inhibitory control, is essential for survival and involves both
              reactively stopping the current prepared action and proactively
              adjusting behavioral tendencies to increase future performance. A
              powerful paradigm widely used in basic and clinical research to
              study inhibitory control is the stop signal task (SST). Recent
              years have seen a surging interest in translating the SST to
              rodents to study the neural mechanisms underlying inhibitory
              control. However, significant differences in task designs and
              behavioral strategies between rodent and primate studies have
              made it difficult to directly compare the two literatures. In
              this study, we developed a rodent-appropriate SST and
              characterized both reactive and proactive control in rats. For
              reactive inhibitory control, we found that, unlike in primates,
              incorrect stop trials in rodents result from two independent
              types of errors: an initial failure-to-stop error or, after
              successful stopping, a subsequent failure-to-wait error.
              Conflating failure-to-stop and failure-to-wait errors
              systematically overestimates the covert latency of reactive
              inhibition, the stop signal reaction time (SSRT). To correctly
              estimate SSRT, we developed and validated a new method that
              provides an unbiased SSRT estimate independent of the ability to
              wait. For proactive inhibitory control, we found that rodents
              adjust both their reaction time and the ability to stop following
              failure-to-wait errors and successful stop trials, but not after
              failure-to-stop errors. Together, these results establish a valid
              rodent model that utilizes proactive and reactive inhibitory
              control strategies similar to primates, and highlight the
              importance of dissociating initial stopping from subsequent
              waiting in studying mechanisms of inhibitory control using

              In females, darting exhibits the characteristics of a learned

              proceeds and disappearing from the CS period during extinction.
              This finding motivates a reinterpretation of rodent fear

              neomycin. Even on a 20-g. protein diet the patient deteriorated
              to a state approaching coma. Colectomy with ileorectal
              anastomosis was performed with good result. The patient remained
              alert and active with no recurrences of cerebral disturbance
              while enjoying a 60-g. protein diet. No additional treatment was
              necessary. The literature on colectomy in the treatment of this
              condition, while brief, reports similar good results. Further
              trial of colectomy is recommended for cases refractory to more
              conservative methods of management.",

  abstract = "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the
              most important causes of hospital infections worldwide.
              High-level resistance to methicillin is caused by the mecA gene,
              which encodes an alternative penicillin-binding protein, PBP 2a.
              To determine the clonal relationships between
              methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and MRSA, we typed 1,069
              S. aureus isolates (493 MSSA isolates and 576 MRSA isolates),
              collected mainly in North American and European hospitals between
              the 1960s and the year 2000, using pulsed-field gel
              electrophoresis and ribotyping. Of 10 widespread S. aureus
              lineages recognized, 8 had corresponding mecA-positive strains.
              Multiresistant MRSA strains are found in hospitals worldwide,
              while unrelated and more susceptible strains represent less than
              1\% of the MRSA population. This supports the hypothesis that
              horizontal transfer plays an important role in the dissemination
              of the mecA gene in the S. aureus population.",
