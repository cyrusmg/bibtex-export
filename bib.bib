              full-time surrogate parents to their grandchildren. These
              grandparents and grandchildren often have serious problems that
              may require assistance from schools and mental health
              professionals. The term 'grandfamily' is used to, easily identify
              families where grandparents raise children because their

              have elevated levels of stress that negatively impact their

              needs places extraordinary stress on parents and other family
              members. A scoping review was undertaken to identify and describe
              the full range of current interventions for reducing caregiver
              stress. METHODS: Applying a broad definition of caregiver stress,
              a systematic search of three scientific databases (CINAHL, Embase
              and Ovid Medline), a general internet search and hand searching
              of key peer-reviewed articles were conducted. Inclusion criteria
              were as follows: (i) published in English between 2004-2016; (ii)
              focused on familial caregivers, defined as parents, siblings or
              extended family; (iii) targeted children/youth with medical
              complexity between the ages of 1-24 years; and (iv) described an
              intervention and impact on caregiver stress. Data on type of
              intervention, study design and methods, measures and overall
              findings were extracted. RESULTS: Forty-nine studies were
              included from a list of 22 339 unique titles. Six domains of
              interventions were found: care coordination models (n = 23);
              respite care (n = 8); telemedicine (n = 5); peer and emotional
              support (n = 6); insurance and employment benefits (n = 4); and
              health and related supports (n = 3). Across studies, there was a
              wide variety of designs, outcomes and measures used. CONCLUSIONS:
              Positive findings of reductions in caregiver stress were noted
              within an emerging body of evidence on effective interventions
              for families of children with medical complexity. A commonality
              across domains was a significant focus on streamlining services
              and reducing the burden of care related to varied pressures
              experienced, including time, finances, care needs and service
              access, among others. There was non-conclusive evidence however
              around which of the six identified intervention domains or
              combination thereof are most effective for reducing stress. These
              promising findings demonstrate that stress reduction is possible
              with the right support and that multiple interventions may be
              effective in reducing burdens of care experienced by families of
              children with medical complexity.",

              adult child on depressive symptoms among older widowed women in
              South Korea. METHOD: Data from the first (2006) and second (2008)
              waves of the Korea Longitudinal Study of Ageing were used. The
              analysis was restricted to widowed women aged >/=65 years with at
              least one living child (N = 2,446). We used an instrumental
              variables (IVs) estimation exploiting two child characteristics
              as IVs (the number of sons and whether the eldest child is a
              daughter). Specification tests for IVs showed that these
              instruments predict the probability of an older widowed woman's
              coresidence with an adult child but do not directly affect
              depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Our IV two-stage least-squares
              estimator suggested that coresidence with an adult child has a
              protective effect on depressive symptoms among older widowed
              women in South Korea. Coresidence was found to be endogenous in
              our statistical model of depressive symptoms. DISCUSSION: The IV
              estimation method can be a useful approach to addressing the
              potential endogeneity between intergenerational coresidence and
              elderly health. Rapidly decreasing rates of intergenerational

              However, this dichotomy does not adequately reflect family
              caregiving experiences; for instance, choice and obligation are
              not mutually exclusive motivations. Rather, choice and obligation
              are ``relational'' and ``contextual'' and manifest in the
              interaction between macro- and micro-contexts. The
              choice-obligation dichotomy is also ideological. At the
              moral-political level, it promotes the downloading of
              responsibility by governments to family, obscures the complexity

              and around Mutare, Zimbabwe in 1992; 18.3\% (95\% CI 15.1-21.5\%)
              of households included orphans. 12.8\% (95\% CI 11.2-14.3\%) of
              children under 15 years old had a father or mother who had died;
              5\% of orphans had lost both parents. Orphan prevalence was
              highest in a peri-urban rural area (17.2\%) and lowest in a
              middle income medium density urban suburb (4.3\%). Recent
              increases in parental deaths were noted; 50\% of parental deaths
              since 1987 could be ascribed to AIDS. Orphan household heads were
              likely to be older and less well-educated than non-orphan
              household heads. The majority of orphaned children were being
              cared for satisfactorily within extended families, often under
              difficult circumstances. Caregiving by maternal relatives
              represents a departure from the traditional practice of caring
              for orphans within the paternal extended family and an adaptation
              of community-coping mechanisms. There was little evidence of
              discrimination or exploitation of orphaned children by extended
              family caregivers. The fact that community coping mechanisms are
              changing does not imply that extended family methods of caring
              are about to break down. However, the emergence of orphan
              households headed by siblings is an indication that the extended
              family is under stress. Emphasis needs to be placed upon
              supporting extended families by utilizing existing
              community-based organizations. Orphan support programmes may need
              to be established initially in high risk communities such as
              low-income urban areas and peri-urban rural areas. In 1992 in
              Zimbabwe, local women conducted interviews with 570 heads of
              household and focus group discussions with caregivers, community
              members, and teachers in and near Mutare (Zimunya, Sakubva, and
              Dangamvura) to determine the prevalence of orphans. 220 orphans
              (12.8\% of all children surveyed) lived in 18.3\% of all the
              households. The prevalence of orphans was lowest in the
              newly-developed, affluent suburb of Dangamvura and highest in the
              very low income, rural area of Zimunya (4.3\% vs. 17.1\%). It
              increased with age (4.9\% for under-fives, 10.1\% for 5-9 years,
              and 23.9\% for 10-14 years). Most orphans (81.8\%) had only lost
              their father. Based on verbal autopsy information, gender, age of
              parent at death, and year of deaths, researchers did not classify
              any deaths before 1987 as being caused by possible or probable
              AIDS. They identified 14 cases of possible AIDS and 14 cases of
              probable AIDS during 1987-1992, however. Only one household
              actually reported AIDS as the cause of death of a parent. AIDS
              was likely the cause of death for 32\% of cases. The average age
              for parents dying before 1987 was 45.7 years compared to 34.3
              years after 1987. A member of the maternal family headed up 84\%
              of orphan households, while a member of the paternal family
              headed up only 16\%. Yet, traditionally the father's side,
              especially the paternal aunt, cares for orphans. In three cases,
              the older sister aged 17-23 cared for younger siblings,
              suggesting that the extended family is under stress. Communities
              stigmatized and discriminated against orphans. Caregivers showed
              genuine concern for the orphans. Few differences in health,
              nutrition, and education between orphaned and nonorphaned
              children supported this concern. Community-based groups,
              particularly those in low income urban areas and periurban rural
              areas, should support extended families to prevent rupture of
              stressed community coping mechanisms. eng",

              experimentally induced pain have been widely reported.
              Specifically, females are at greater risk for developing several
              chronic pain disorders, and women exhibit greater sensitivity to
              noxious stimuli in the laboratory compared with men. Several
              mechanisms have been proposed to account for these sex
              differences. Psychosocial factors such as sex role beliefs, pain
              coping strategies, mood, and pain-related expectancies may
              underlie these effects. In addition, there is evidence that
              familial factors can alter pain responses, and these
              intergenerational influences may differ as a function of sex. Sex
              hormones are also known to affect pain responses, which may
              mediate the sex differences. Although the magnitude of these
              effects has not been well characterized, there are potentially
              important practical implications of sex differences in pain

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Cross-informant disagreement is common and results
              in different interpretations of a youth's behavior. Theoretical
              explanations for discrepancies typically rely on scale level
              analyses. This article explores whether caregivers and
              adolescents differ in when they notice and report symptoms of
              youth mania depending on the severity of overall manic
              disturbance. METHOD: Participants were 459 adolescent-caregiver
              pairs recruited at either a community mental health center or an
              academic medical center. Adolescents were most likely to have a
              primary diagnosis of unipolar depression (37\%) or
              attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder/disruptive behavior
              disorder (36\%). Nineteen percent of adolescents received a
              bipolar spectrum disorder diagnosis (4\% bipolar I and 15\%
              bipolar II, cyclothymia, or bipolar not otherwise specificed).
              Caregivers were primarily biological mothers (74\%) or
              grandparents (8\%). Adolescents and caregivers independently
              completed the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) about the
              adolescent. RESULTS: Item response theory analyses of the entire
              sample indicated that in general, both caregivers and adolescents
              reserved endorsement of mania symptoms for the most severely ill
              half of participants. Comparisons of caregiver and adolescent
              report of symptoms on the MDQ indicated two significant
              differences. Caregivers were more likely to report irritability
              at significantly lower severity of mania than adolescents.
              Adolescents endorsed only increased energy or hyperactivity at
              lower severities than caregivers. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents and
              caregivers will have different concerns and might report
              different symptoms consistent with whom the symptom impacts
              first. Caregivers are more likely to report behaviors such as
              irritability, whereas adolescents are more likely to report

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Sub-Saharan Africa is home to approximately 55
              million orphaned children. The growing orphan crisis has
              overwhelmed many communities and has weakened the ability of
              extended families to meet traditional care-taking expectations.
              Other models of care and support have emerged in sub-Saharan
              Africa to address the growing orphan crisis, yet there is a lack
              of information on these models available in the literature. We
              applied a human rights framework using the United Nations
              Convention on the Rights of the Child to understand what extent
              children's basic human rights were being upheld in institutional
              vs. community- or family-based care settings in Uasin Gishu
              County, Kenya. METHODS: The Orphaned and Separated Children's
              Assessments Related to their Health and Well-Being Project is a
              5-year cohort of orphaned children and adolescents aged </=18
              year. This descriptive analysis was restricted to baseline data.
              Chi-Square test was used to test for associations between
              categorical /dichotomous variables. Fisher's exact test was also
              used if some cells had expected value of less than 5. RESULTS:
              Included in this analysis are data from 300 households, 19
              Charitable Children's Institutions (CCIs) and 7 community-based
              organizations. In total, 2871 children were enrolled and had
              baseline assessments done: 1390 in CCI's and 1481 living in
              households in the community. We identified and described four
              broad models of care for orphaned and separated children,
              including: institutional care (sub-classified as 'Pure CCI' for
              those only providing residential care, 'CCI-Plus' for those
              providing both residential care and community-based supports to
              orphaned children , and 'CCI-Shelter' which are rescue,
              detention, or other short-term residential support), family-based
              care, community-based care and self-care. Children in
              institutional care (95\%) were significantly (p < 0.0001) more
              likely to have their basic material needs met in comparison to
              those in family-based care (17\%) and institutions were better
              able to provide an adequate standard of living. CONCLUSIONS: Each
              model of care we identified has strengths and weaknesses. The
              orphan crisis in sub-Saharan Africa requires a diversity of care
              environments in order to meet the needs of children and uphold
              their rights. Family-based care plays an essential role; however,
              households require increased support to adequately care for
              children.",

              grandchildren more often as a result of their adult children's
              drug addiction, mental problems, and financial need. This study
              examined grandmothers' well-being in relation to bonding within
              intergenerational triads consisting of grandmother, parent, and
              grandchild. Methods. Interviews were conducted with 987
              grandmothers recruited through schools and media, including 512
              custodial grandmothers raising their grandchildren and 475
              coparenting grandmothers helping their adult sons or daughters to
              raise their grandchildren. Results. Contrary to expectation,
              triangulation involving a weak parent-grandmother relationship
              was not related to significantly lower grandmother well-being. In
              contrast, the emotionally isolated parent, particularly common in
              custodial families, was related to lower grandmother well-being,
              whether or not the parent lived in the household. The
              configuration in which the parent provided a link for both other
              generations was frequent in coparenting families, but it was not
              significantly different in grandmother well-being compared to
              other linking triads. Discussion. Intergenerational triad types
              appear to be broadly relevant emotional configurations that
              transcend living situations but appear with different frequencies
              in custodial and coparenting families. Results affirm the utility

              ``Research of Productivity by Intergenerational Sympathy
              (REPRINTS)'' in which senior volunteers engage in reading picture
              books to children. The ``REPRINTS'' program consistently involves
              social roles and intellectual activity, two higher-level
              functional capacities. This study reported findings and problems
              experienced through ``REPRINTS'' during the first year,
              ascertained potential effectiveness of social activity, and
              proposed methods for continued activity. METHODS: Basic concepts
              of ``REPRINTS''program include ``contribution to society'',
              ``life-long learning'', and ``group activity.'' Sixty seven
              volunteers and 74 controls, all aged 60 years and over living in
              three areas, ie., Chuo-ku, central Tokyo, Kawasaki city, suburb
              of Tokyo and Nagahama city, a local city, participated in a
              baseline health check-up in June, 2004. After completion of
              3-month training seminars (once a week, 2 hr per session),
              volunteers visited public elementary schools and kindergartens in
              groups of 6-10 persons for 6 months. They were assessed again by
              follow-up health check-up in March, 2005. RESULTS: At baseline,
              the proportion of those who had no grand children (41.8\% vs.
              20.3\%, P= 0.006), average school years (13.4 +/- 2.5 vs. 12.3
              +/- 2.5 years, P= 0.008), having any experience of volunteer
              activities (79.1\% vs. 52.7\%, P=0.001), and an usual walking
              speed (86.7 +/- 12.3 vs. 81.3 +/- 12.9 m/min, P=0.012) were
              significantly higher in volunteers than in controls. There was no
              significant difference in other baseline characteristics between
              the two groups. At follow-up, social network scores for 56
              volunteers were significantly improved: frequency of contact with
              grandchildren and others around neighborhood and size of circles
              of friends and acquaintances were increased, as compared to
              controls. Social support scores for the volunteers significantly
              decreased in the receiving aspect, while increased in the giving
              aspect. In addition, consciousness of loving community and
              self-rated health were significantly enhanced and hand-grip
              strength showed significantly less decline in volunteers than in
              controls. CONCLUSIONS: Through engaging in the intergenerational
              and intellectual volunteer programs for 9 months, subjective
              health, social support and network, consciousness of loving
              community and some aspects of physical performance were
              significantly promoted in senior volunteers. Coordination of
              existing administrative services enabled us to establish this
              ``REPRINTS'' health promotion program for community-dwelling
              older adults.",

              from the needs of the older generation, whereas in Italy it is
              more likely to reflect a cultural preference. Employing data from

              Our findings showed that, in Britain, mothers' health had a
              greater impact on proximity than in Italy, suggesting that the
              needs of the older generation in Britain were important for
              determining proximity. An additional analysis showed that
              children's characteristics were also important in determining
              proximity in Italy, mainly because of delayed adult transitions.
              This supports the hypothesis that intergenerational proximity in

              than of parents.",

              during adolescence presents a major public health burden.
              Research from high-income countries indicates that evidence-based
              parenting program interventions can reduce child maltreatment.
              Much less is known, however, about how beneficiaries of these
              programs experience this process of change. Understanding the
              process that brings about change in child maltreatment practices
              is essential to understanding intervention mechanisms of change.
              This is particularly important given the current scale-up of
              parenting programs across low- and middle-income countries.
              OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to provide insight into how
              caregivers and adolescents attending a parenting program in South
              Africa perceived changes associated with abuse reduction.
              METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with
              caregivers and adolescents (n = 42) after the intervention, as
              well as observations of sessions (n = 9) and focus group
              discussions (n = 240 people). Participants were adolescents
              between the ages of 10-18 and their primary caregiver residing in
              peri-urban and rural program clusters in the Eastern Cape
              Province of South Africa. Data were coded in Atlas.ti, and
              thematic content analysis was conducted. FINDINGS: Based on
              participant perceptions, the Sinovuyo Teen parenting program
              workshops catalyzed change into practice by creating an
              environment that was conducive to learning alternatives. It did
              so through prioritizing a process of mutual respect, openness,
              and being valued by others, giving legitimacy to a respectful
              reciprocity and new ways of spending time together that enabled
              caregivers and teenagers to shift and normalize more positive
              behaviors. This in turn led to reductions in physical and verbal
              abuse. CONCLUSIONS: This study's findings may be of use to
              policymakers and practitioners who need to understand how
              parenting programs support parents and teenagers in increasing
              positive parenting approaches and changing potentially harmful
              practices. It additionally highlights the importance of assessing
              the experiences of both parents and teenagers attending such
              programs.",

              Community Survey/Census 2000 Supplementary Survey. In 2000 there
              were estimated to be nearly 53,000 AI/AN grandparent caregivers
              age 45 and older in the United States. Almost half of the
              caregiving grandparents had been raising a grandchild for five
              years or longer. The findings reveal a portrait of grandparents
              committed to raising their grandchildren despite the fact that
              many were living in extreme poverty, with ill health, and with
              limited resources and services. One-third of grandparent
              caregivers were living below the poverty line, and only
              one-quarter of these were receiving public assistance. Even when
              compared with their noncaregiving AI/AN peers, grandparents
              raising grandchildren were disproportionately female, poor,
              living with a functional disability, and living in overcrowded
              conditions. Implications for social work practice are presented

              partners as roles are gained or relinquished. For children this
              may result in a loss of parenting. The adjustment process to any
              psychological or personality changes may be very painful,
              particularly if children have no one outside the family to
              provide informed support. Acquired illness or disability in

  abstract = "Focus group discussions and interviews were held with 40 orphans,
              25 caretakers and 33 other community workers from a rural area
              near Mutare, Zimbabwe. Orphan concerns included feeling different
              from other children, stress, stigmatization, exploitation,
              schooling, lack of visits and neglect of support responsibilities
              by relatives. Many community members, while recognizing their
              limitations due to poverty, were already actively helping orphans
              and caretakers. Extended family networks are the primary resource
              for orphans, though some relatives exploit orphans or fail to
              fulfil their responsibilities. Interventions are suggested which
              support community coping mechanisms by strengthening the
              capacities of families to care for orphans. Outside organizations
              can develop partnerships with community groups, helping them to
              respond to the impact of AIDS, by building upon existing concern
              for orphan families. They can help affected communities to
              develop orphan support activities which encourage caring
              responses by community leaders and relatives and which discourage
              property-grabbing and orphan neglect. Material support channelled
              through community groups to destitute families at critical times
              can strengthen family coping mechanisms. Income-generating
              activities should build upon communities' existing capabilities
              and benefit the most vulnerable orphan households. Some
              communities are responding to the AIDS disaster by adaptations to
              cope with devastating changes taking place in their communities.
              Interviews and focus group discussions involving 40 orphans, 25
              caretakers, and 33 community workers from a rural area near
              Mutare, Zimbabwe, explored community responses to children
              orphaned as a result of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
              (AIDS) pandemic and other factors. Mutare is the site of a
              church-based orphan support program that provides home visits,
              material assistance, and counseling to orphan households. A 1995
              enumeration in Mutare revealed 14.7\% of children were orphaned.
              The extended family remains the principle orphan-care unit,
              although some relatives exploit the children's labor and fail to
              meet their educational and medical needs. Only 5 orphans felt
              there were no differences between themselves and non-orphaned
              children. Orphans reported they were forced to work rather than
              attend school, isolated from peers, neglected or maltreated by
              caretakers, and stigmatized. Stigmatization was more likely to be
              based on orphan status or poverty than AIDS as the cause of a
              parent's death. Despite the area's substantial poverty, many
              families with orphans had received assistance from community
              members and local churches. The orphan visiting program has
              promoted a generally humane attitude toward these children.
              Traditional community leaders and community visitors can exercise
              moral influence by encouraging relatives to fulfill their family
              responsibilities, protecting the inheritance rights of orphans
              and widows, and helping vulnerable families retain and use their
              land. Outside organizations can channel direct material support
              (e.g., food relief, medical costs, and school fees) through
              community groups to enhance the coping capabilities of destitute
              families and assist communities in developing income-generating
              activities. eng",

              within household power relations--her autonomy with respect to
              other household members--influences her ability to provide for
              the health of her children. We argue that in the context of the
              Arab Middle East, a woman's structural position within the
              household is a good indicator of her relative autonomy: if she is
              the daughter-in-law in a vertically extended residential unit,
              she has less autonomy than if she is head or co-head of
              household. Our analysis is based on data collected from 1341
              households in 1985 as a part of the Follow-up Health and
              Population Assessment of four urban settlements in Amman, Jordan.
              They include measures of the child's weight and age, plus a
              variety of socioeconomic factors. We analyze the effect of the
              mother's autonomy on child nutritional status within a multiple
              regression framework that controls for rival hypotheses. In
              particular, we investigate whether it is the availability of
              other potential child-care substitutes, particularly the
              grandmother, that influences child nutrition rather than
              household structure. We also look at household income, mother's
              education, the area of residence, and the child's sex. Our
              results show a strong negative influence associated with having a
              mother whose autonomy in the household is low. This effect does
              not disappear when mother's age and education, and household size
              and composition are taken into consideration. Nor is it a proxy
              for the higher household incomes characteristic of
              extended-family residential units with their multiple earners.",

              the BHPS data overestimate the proportion of people who report an
              experience of life in a non-intact family during childhood by
              about 10\%. Although an explanation based on recall error that
              deteriorates with the age of the BHPS respondents is possible,
              the overestimation is likely to be accounted for by non-ignorable
              attrition that may affect most of the comparison studies based on
              longitudinal data. Conversely, comparisons with other independent
              measurements from the BHPS itself reveal that the wave 6 data
              underestimate the proportion of young people who have lived at
              least part of their childhood in a non-intact family by about
              8\%. The probability of disagreement between these two sets of
              measures is strongly associated with poor interview
              characteristics, which may affect the comparison measure more
              than the wave 6 measure. Despite such differences, there is
              therefore a substantial degree of similarity between the family
              structure information that was collected in the sixth wave of the
              BHPS and the host of highly diverse records against which it has
              been compared.",

              are clearly high, but people will need considerable help to
              realize this potential. For some children alternatives other than

              reproductive and non-reproductive health problems. Documentation
              of secular trends in stature has been based primarily on
              cross-sectional studies of special populations, primarily of men.
              The objective of this study is to determine how growth and
              socio-economic status (SES) factors relate to stature changes
              among lineal female relatives, maternal grandmothers to mothers.
              Methods The study base was derived from a population-based
              intergenerational cohort which linked several statewide databases
              to data from the mothers' own birth certificates: the Washington
              State Intergenerational Cohort. Mothers in these ethnic groups
              were separately studied: non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans,
              Native Americans, Hispanics. We generated simple, partial, and
              multiple correlation coefficients to investigate the association
              between stature and other growth and SES factors. Results A
              mother's stature is determined partly by her own mother's stature
              and partly by her birthweight. These two measures are
              individually stronger predictors of stature than are several
              available SES factors considered in combination-grandmother's
              age, parity, marital status, and mother's age. The maximal
              multiple correlation models yielded R-2 values from 18\% to 28\%.
              Conclusions Growth measures are stronger predictors of
              intergenerational changes in stature than are the several
              available socio-economic factors. However, socio-economic factors
              are partly responsible for the level of achieved prenatal and
              postnatal growth. Since grandmother's stature is a determinant of
              mother's birthweight, which in turn is a determinant of infant
              birthweight, some environmentally influenced determinants of some
              birth outcomes are already established before a prospective
              mother is conceived or born.",

              vulnerable households during times of stress. In sub-Saharan
              Africa, extended families, together with communities, are the
              most effective responses enabling access to support for
              households facing crises. This paper reviews literature on
              informal social security systems in sub-Saharan Africa, analyses
              changes taking place in their functioning as a result of HIV/AIDS
              and describes community safety net components including economic
              associations, cooperatives, loan providers, philanthropic groups
              and HIV/AIDS initiatives. Community safety nets target households
              in greatest need, respond rapidly to crises, are cost efficient,
              based on local needs and available resources, involve the
              specialized knowledge of community members and provide financial
              and psycho-social support. Their main limitations are lack of
              material resources and reliance on unpaid labour of women.
              Changes have taken place in safety net mechanisms because of
              HIV/AIDS, suggesting the resilience of communities rather than
              their impending collapse. Studies are lacking that assess the
              value of informal community-level transfers, describe how safety
              nets assist the poor or analyse modifications in response to
              HIV/AIDS. The role of community safety nets remains largely
              invisible under the radar of governments, non-governmental
              organizations and international bodies. External support can

              cohort study with 1-year follow-up. SETTING: General community.
              PARTICIPANTS: Volunteer, consecutive sample of parents of 124
              preadolescents with a variety of chronic conditions. METHODS:
              In-depth, in-home interviews conducted with parents. Quantitative
              data from the Social Support Assessment questionnaire was used to
              assess and compare sources and types of helpful support at
              baseline and 1 year later. Content analytic methods were used to
              categorize unsupportive behaviors described by parents during the
              first interview. RESULTS: Both mothers and fathers reported that
              other family members were the primary source of helpful emotional
              and tangible support, while health care providers were the
              primary source of helpful informational support. The amount of
              perceived support from family members, community members, and
              service providers stayed relatively stable over time, except that
              fathers reported a significant increase in helpful emotional and
              informational support from extended family members from baseline
              to 1 year later. Also, 388 incidents of unsupportive behaviors
              were identified; the majority of these behaviors were attributed
              to health professionals and extended family members. CONCLUSION:
              While patterns of perceived support remained relatively stable
              over a 1-year period, reports of unsupportive behaviors suggest
              gaps in service and problems that must be addressed to improve

              considerations relating to the physical and behavioral well-being
              of children raised by their grandparents. RECENT FINDINGS: As the
              number of children being raised by their grandparents in the
              United States steadily increases, the needs of these families
              require greater attention. These children and their custodial
              grandparents face unique health, social, legal, and financial
              challenges. Children being raised by their grandparents are at
              higher risk for developmental and behavioral problems because of
              prior or current adverse family environments. Moreover, there is
              evidence that custodial grandparents may experience negative
              health, social, and financial outcomes that may constrain their
              ability to provide the best care for their grandchildren.
              SUMMARY: Pediatricians should not only be aware of the medical
              and developmental status of children who are being reared by
              their grandparents, but also assess the needs, abilities, and
              potential limitations of these custodial grandparents. In
              addition to providing useful parenting advice and direct support
              to custodial grandparents, pediatricians should refer these
              families as needed to local grandparenting groups, social service
              agencies, experienced legal counsel, and relevant national
              organizations for support and guidance.",

               place in the group was video-recorded and transcribed verbatim.
               Thematic content analysis of this data indicates that caregivers
               are very receptive to the intervention, which they see in the
               role of 'grandmother.' Yet, their socially and economically weak

               Fokusgruppe von 11 Bezugspersonen, die bewusst ausgew{\"a}hlt
               wurden, gesammelt. Die Diskussion, die in der Gruppe stattfand,
               wurde auf Video aufgezeichnet und w{\"o}rtlich transkribiert.
               Eine thematische Inhaltsanalyse dieser Daten zeigt, dass die
               Bezugspersonen sehr empf{\"a}nglich f{\"u}r die Intervention
               sind, welche sie wie eine Art 'Gro{\ss}mutter' wahrnehmen. Doch

               サンプリングを用いて選択した11人の養育者とのフォーカス・グループを行うことによって、集められた。グループで行われた討論は、ビデオ録画され、逐語記録された。このデータの主題内容分析から、養育者は介入をとても良く受け止め、養育者はその介入に「おばあちゃん」の役割を見ていた。しかし、彼女たちは社会的経済的に弱い立場にいるので、介入を完全に使いこなすことはできない。理想的には、彼女たちは専門家に手をさしのべて欲しいと思う。この研究は、早期の親乳幼児介入において、相談室を越えて動くことと養育者の条件で彼女たちと会うことが、いかに重要かを強調する。

              grandparents (N = 442). Using data from the Longitudinal Study of

              over 15 years. Growth curve analysis was used to compare

              depressive symptoms. Grandparents who lost contact with their
