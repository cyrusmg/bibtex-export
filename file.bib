              galaxies VV114 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
              Array (ALMA) Band 3. We also find an 880-um counterpart with ALMA
              Band 7 (S\_880um = 11.2 mJy). A careful comparison of the
              intensities of the line and the continuum suggests that the line
              is a redshifted 12CO transition. A photometric redshift analysis
              using the infrared to radio data favors a CO redshift of z =
              2.467, although z = 3.622 is acceptable. We also find a hard
              X-ray counterpart, suggesting the presence of a luminous (L\_X ~

              column (N\_H ~ 2 x 10^23 cm^-2 if z = 2.47). A cosmological

              single ALMA field of view and 7.5-GHz bandwidth at 99.75 GHz.
              This demonstrates that ALMA has sufficient sensitivity to find an
              emission-line galaxy such as ALMA J010748.3-173028 even by

  author   = "Petrella, Robert J and Lattanzio, Chastity N and Overend, Tom J",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Primary care physicians are ideally positioned to
              affect a large population at risk for epidemics of sedentary
              lifestyle; however, it is unclear what type of counseling they
              provide. METHODS: A questionnaire was used to obtain information
              on primary care physicians' behaviors with respect to counseling
              and prescribing physical activity, physician demographics, and
              practice characteristics. Registered primary care physicians in
              Canada were contacted in all 10 provinces and 2 territories.
              RESULTS: Of 27 980 primary care physicians, 14 319 returned
              usable questionnaires and 13 166 were eligible for study
              participation (response rate, 51.2\%). Respondents were
              predominantly male (61.1\%), practiced in private office/clinic
              settings (73.4\%), and had graduated from medical school more
              than 22 years earlier. Eighty-five percent of respondents
              reported asking patients about their physical activity levels,
              whereas only 26.2\% assessed patient fitness as part of a
              physical examination or through a fitness test and only 10.9\%
              referred patients to others for fitness assessment or appraisal.
              Most physicians (69.8\%) reported using verbal counseling to
              promote physical activity, whereas only 15.8\% used written
              prescriptions for a physical activity promotion program. Male and
              female physicians responded differently. Men more frequently
              assessed fitness than did women, whereas women more frequently
              asked and provided verbal and written directions. CONCLUSIONS:
              This large sample of Canadian primary care physicians regularly
              asked patients about physical activity levels and advised them

              assess the efficacy and safety of topiramate as a
              migraine-preventive therapy. DESIGN: A 26-week, randomized,
              double-blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Outpatient
              treatment at 49 US clinical centers. Patients Patients were aged
              12 to 65 years, had a 6-month International Headache Society
              migraine history, and experienced 3 to 12 migraines per month,
              but had 15 or fewer headache days per month during the 28-day
              baseline period. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to
              placebo or topiramate, 50, 100, or 200 mg/d, titrated by 25 mg/wk
              to the assigned dose or as tolerated in 8 weeks; maintenance
              therapy continued for 18 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The
              primary efficacy assessment was a reduction in mean monthly
              migraine frequency across the 6-month treatment phase. Secondary
              end points were responder rate, time to onset of action, mean
              change in migraine days per month, and mean change in rescue
              medication days per month. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-seven
              patients were randomized, and 469 composed the intent-to-treat
              population. The mean +/- SD monthly migraine frequency decreased
              significantly for the 100-mg/d group (from 5.4 +/- 2.2 to 3.3 +/-
              2.9; P <.001) and the 200-mg/d group (from 5.6 +/- 2.6 to 3.3 +/-
              2.9; P <.001) vs the placebo group (from 5.6 +/- 2.3 to 4.6 +/-
              3.0); improvements occurred within the first treatment month.
              Significantly more topiramate-treated patients (50 mg/d, 35.9\%
              [P =.04]; 100 mg/d, 54.0\% [P <.001]; and 200 mg/d, 52.3\% [P
              <.001]) exhibited a 50\% or more reduction in monthly migraine
              frequency than placebo-treated patients (22.6\%). Adverse events
              included paresthesia, fatigue, nausea, anorexia, and taste per

              accuracy of depression screening instruments; (2) the effect of

              the effect of screening on depression and cardiac outcomes in

              from inception to May 1, 2008; manual journal searches; reference
              list reviews; and citation tracking of included articles. STUDY
              SELECTION: We included articles in any language about patients in
              cardiovascular care settings that (1) compared a screening
              instrument to a valid major depressive disorder criterion
              standard; (2) compared depression treatment with placebo or usual
              care in a randomized controlled trial; or (3) assessed the effect
              of screening on depression identification and treatment rates,
              depression, or cardiac outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION: Methodological
              characteristics and outcomes were extracted by 2 investigators.
              RESULTS: We identified 11 studies about screening accuracy, 6
              depression treatment trials, but no studies that evaluated the
              effects of screening on depression or cardiovascular outcomes. In
              studies that tested depression screening instruments using a
              priori-defined cutoff scores, sensitivity ranged from 39\% to
              100\% (median, 84\%) and specificity ranged from 58\% to 94\%
              (median, 79\%). Depression treatment with medication or cognitive
              behavioral therapy resulted in modest reductions in depressive
              symptoms (effect size, 0.20-0.38; r(2), 1\%-4\%). There was no
              evidence that depression treatment improved cardiac outcomes.
              Among patients with depression and history of myocardial
              infarction in the ENRICHD trial, there was no difference in
              event-free survival between participants treated with cognitive
              behavioral therapy supplemented by an antidepressant vs usual
              care (75.5\% vs 74.7\%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Depression
              treatment with medication or cognitive behavioral therapy in
              patients with cardiovascular disease is associated with modest
              improvement in depressive symptoms but no improvement in cardiac
              outcomes. No clinical trials have assessed whether screening for

              to be increasingly stressful for students in higher education,
              but there is limited research about the extent to which those
              attending student counselling services experience difficulties
              relating to academic issues and how effective counselling is for
              them. Aim The study aimed to evaluate the reliable and clinically
              significant change for students with self-reported academic
              issues. Reliable change occurs when a change in the outcome being
              measured is not attributable to error, while clinically
              significant change occurs when a person moves from a clinical
              population to a healthy population after an intervention, in this
              case counselling. Methodology Pre-existing data from 129
              university students who had attended a student counselling
              service were analysed to determine levels of reliable change and
              clinically significant change. These data related to
              psychological status before and after counselling based on
              CORE-OM total scores; self-report of the impact of counselling on
              academic issues; and demographic variables. Findings In total,
              117 (92\%) of students reported experiencing academic issues to
              some extent. Counselling was found to result in reliable change
              for 67\% and clinically significant change for 40\% of those
              students reporting academic issues. Implications The results of
              the study suggest that, even where academic reasons are not the
              primary cause of referral to student counselling services, a
              significant number of students will also experience difficulties
              in these areas. Counselling was, however, shown to result in
              reliable and clinically significant change in a high percentage

  abstract = "There is a growing body of theoretical and clinical literature
              highlighting the role of pride in maintaining eating disordered
              behaviours. Despite its clinical importance, there are no
              measures to assess feelings of pride associated with eating
              psychopathology. This study describes the development and
              validation of the Pride in Eating Pathology Scale (PEP-S), a
              self-report questionnaire that examines feelings of pride towards
              eating disordered symptoms (e.g., pride in food restriction,
              thinness and weight loss). Participants were 390 females,
              recruited from university and community populations, whose mean
              age was 26.99 years. Respondents rated pride in eating pathology
              on a 7-point Likert-scale. Principal Component Analysis indicated
              that the 60-item scale comprised a four component structure: (1)
              pride in weight loss, food control and thinness, (2) pride in
              healthy weight and healthy eating, (3) pride in outperforming
              others and social recognition and (4) pride in capturing other
              people's attention due to extreme thinness. These four components
              explained a total of 65.31\% of the variance. The PEP-S
              demonstrated very good internal reliability ($\alpha$ ranging
              from 0.88 to 0.98) and very good test-retest reliability over a
              3-week time-span (r ranging from 0.81 to 0.93). The PEP-S also
              showed excellent convergent and discriminant validity.
              Furthermore, the scale discriminated between women with high and
              low levels of eating psychopathology. The PEP-S is a
              psychometrically robust measure of pride in eating pathology. It
              has the potential to advance theoretical understanding and may
              also be clinically useful. Copyright \copyright{} 2015 John Wiley
              \& Sons, Ltd. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE: The PEP-S is a valid,
              reliable, quick and easy to administer self-report questionnaire
              that measures pride related to eating pathology. The PEP-S
              assesses four clinically relevant dimensions: (1) pride in weight
              loss, food control and thinness, (2) pride in healthy weight and
              healthy eating, (3) pride in outperforming others and social
              recognition and (4) pride in capturing other people's attention
              due to extreme thinness. The PEP-S has very good internal and
              test-retest reliability, and very good convergent and
              discriminant validity. The PEP-S distinguishes between women with
              higher and lower levels of eating psychopathology. The PEP-S
              makes an important contribution to understanding pride in eating
              psychopathology, which is essential from both clinical and
              theoretical perspectives.",

              role to beliefs about mental states, including beliefs about

              well as the dialectical behaviour therapy and emotion-focused

              develop a questionnaire to measure the beliefs about emotions as

              new measure to various aspects of emotion regulation in a

               in families and is associated with health and safety risks and
               family problems. The present study examined gender- and
               diagnosis-related differences in reports of hoarding symptoms
               among first-degree relatives of people who hoard, and of
               clinical and community samples. METHODS: The present study
               included 443 participants in a study of hoarding behavior: 217
               with hoarding disorder (HD), 96 with obsessive-compulsive
               disorder (OCD), and 130 nonclinical community controls (CC).
               Assessment included a detailed interview of familial patterns of
               hoarding behaviors among parents and siblings and measures of
               hoarding severity. RESULTS: In the combined sample, participants
               reported more hoarding among female (mothers, sisters) than male
               (fathers, brothers) relatives. Significantly more female than
               male participants indicated they had a parent or any
               first-degree relative with hoarding behaviors. However, within
               the HD sample no significant gender effects were found for
               household, safety, and functioning variables, or for hoarding
               symptom severity. In an age- and gender-matched subsample (total
               n = 150), HD participants reported more hallmark hoarding
               symptoms (difficulty discarding and saving/clutter), and
               acquiring among their relatives compared to OCD and CC samples,
               and parents had higher rates than siblings. CONCLUSIONS:
               Hoarding symptoms appear to be common among first-degree
               relatives of people who hoard and are also found among relatives
               of control samples. The predominance of hoarding symptoms among
               female relatives may indicate genetic or modeling transmission
               but this requires further study using large twin samples.
               Clinicians should consider that family members may also have
               significant hoarding symptoms.",

              eating disorders (ED) with four Axis II personality disorders
              (PD) and with major depressive disorder (MDD) without PD. The
              eating disorders met criteria outlined in the 4th edition of the
              Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).
              METHOD: Six hundred sixty-eight patients recruited for the
              Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS)
              were reliably assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for
              DSM-IV Axis I Disorders and the Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV
              Personality Disorders. The distribution of ED diagnoses was
              compared among four PD study groups (schizotypal, borderline,
              avoidant, obsessive-compulsive) and a fifth study group with MDD
              without any PD. RESULTS: The distribution of lifetime diagnoses
              of anorexia nervosa (N = 40), bulimia nervosa (N = 56), and
              eating disorder not otherwise specified (N = 118) did not differ
              significantly across the five study groups, between the MDD group

              CONCLUSIONS: ED diagnoses did not differentially co-occur
              significantly across common Axis I and II disorders. The pattern
              of ED lifetime co-occurrence rates demonstrates the powerful
              influence of base rates and highlights that declarations of

              influences on body image and eating disturbances-the
              Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire (SATAQ).
              METHOD: Two independent samples of college females completed a
              revision and extension of the SATAQ and factor analyses were
              conducted to determine the underlying structure of the revised
              scale. RESULTS: Factor analyses indicated two distinct
              internalization factors: one appeared to reflect a generic media
              influence related to TV, magazines, and movies. A second factor
              clearly reflected internalization of athletic and sports figures.
              Two other factors, reflecting media pressures and media as an
              informational source, also emerged. Another widely used measure
              of thin-ideal internalization, the Ideal Body Internalization
              Scale-Revised (IBIS-R), was included in factor analyses to
              determine its empirical relationship with the revised SATAQ. None
              of the IBIS-R items loaded with any of the internalization items

              the IBIS-R appeared to tap into an awareness of appearance norms

              validity with measures of body image and eating disturbance.
              Eating-disturbed and eating-disordered samples had higher scores

  author    = "Simpson, Courtney C and Mazzeo, Suzanne E",
  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: A pattern of disordered eating involving a
               pathological fixation with healthy food consumption, labeled
               orthorexia nervosa (ON), has recently generated attention;
               however, research has not yet investigated perceptions of
               ON-related behaviors. This study examined potential
               stigmatization of ON, compared with DSM-5 ED diagnoses. METHOD:
               Participants (N = 505) were randomly assigned to read a vignette
               depicting a woman with anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa
               (BN), binge-eating disorder (BED), or ON. They then answered
               questions about the individual depicted in the vignette. A
               series of MANOVAs investigated whether opinions and beliefs
               about the person depicted varied as a function of the disorder
               described in the vignette. RESULTS: Individuals with ON were
               perceived as less likely to ``improve with treatment'' than
               individuals with BN, and less likely to ``pull themselves
               together,'' than individuals with BED. Individuals with ON and
               AN were viewed as ``hard[er] to talk to'' and more of a ``danger
               to others'' compared with individuals with BED. ON was viewed as
               less distressing, less likely to evoke sympathy, and more
               acceptable than the other disorders. Finally, ``poor living
               choices'' were perceived as contributing more substantially to
               ON. Participants' attributions of various personality
               characteristics did not differ based on ED diagnosis.
               DISCUSSION: Results suggest that ON is viewed as less severe,
               more desirable, and more often the result of personal life
               choices. However, findings also imply that ON is associated with
               stigma, similar to DSM-5 EDs. These negative attitudes might
               reinforce ON behaviors, and limit awareness of their potential
               complications.",

  abstract  = "In summary, fluoxetine is a highly selective serotonin uptake
               inhibitor in vitro and in vivo. The conformation of fluoxetine,
               which resembles that of sertraline and other serotonin uptake
               inhibitors, appears to be a key feature that enables its high
               affinity and selective interaction with the serotonin
               transporter. The para-trifluoromethyl substituent, however, is
               also a pivotal structural element. The molecular pharmacology of
               fluoxetine has been well-defined, and its in vivo
               pharmacological effects appear to be mediated almost exclusively
               by serotonin uptake inhibition. Its selectivity for the
               serotonin transporter, lack of affinity for neurotransmitter
               receptors, and retention of selectivity following metabolism to
               norfluoxetine make fluoxetine a useful tool to explore
               pharmacologically induced increases in serotonin
               neurotransmission. Fluoxetine has found a variety of therapeutic
               application. Its use in treating depression has been most
               extensively studied, but controlled clinical studies also
               suggest the drug may have a role in treating obesity and
               bulimia. Moreover, a variety of other psychiatric disorders may
               be treatable with this drug. Regardless of the outcome of these
               clinical trials, it is apparent that fluoxetine has found a
               useful niche in therapy, and can be used as a probe to determine
               the role of serotonin in modulating human pathophysiologies.",

              day. The interaction between fluoxetine and carbohydrate
              consumption was examined by providing subjects diets that
              engendered varied levels of carbohydrate intake. When subjects
              received placebo and had access to a regular diet, they consumed
              3400 kcal day-1 (53\% carbohydrate, 34\% fat, 13\% protein); and
              fluoxetine decreased caloric intake to 2770 Kcal, without
              affecting macronutrient contribution. Caloric intake (2730 Kcal;
              67\% carbohydrate) under the high-carbohydrate condition when
              subjects received fluoxetine was not different from intake under

              the high-fat (low-carbohydrate) diet was less palatable and

              2:1; the figure was sensibly lower with the 35-point threshold

              enrolled. Then they were randomized into two samples (sample of

              of orthorexia ORTO-15; sample of 121 subjects for the validation

              RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The test we proposed for the diagnosis of

              threshold value of 40 (efficacy 73.8\%, sensitivity 55.6\% and

               stress (ELS) in humans on later behavior and neurobiology is a
               fast developing field. While epidemiological and neurobiological
               studies paint a somber picture of negative outcomes, relatively
               little attention has been devoted to integrating the breadth of
               findings concerning possible cognitive and emotional deficits
               associated with ELS. Emerging findings from longitudinal studies
               examining developmental trajectories of the brain in healthy
               samples may provide a new framework to understand mechanisms
               underlying ELS sequelae. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this review was
               twofold. The first was to summarize findings from longitudinal
               data on normative brain development. The second was to utilize
               this framework of normative brain development to interpret
               changes in developmental trajectories associated with deficits
               in cognitive and affective function following ELS. RESULTS: Five
               principles of normative brain development were identified and
               used to discuss behavioral and neural sequelae of ELS. Early
               adversity was found to be associated with deficits in a range of
               cognitive (cognitive performance, memory, and executive
               functioning) and affective (reward processing, processing of
               social and affective stimuli, and emotion regulation) functions.
               CONCLUSION: Three general conclusions emerge: (1) higher-order,
               complex cognitive and affective functions associated with brain
               regions undergoing protracted postnatal development are
               particularly vulnerable to the deleterious effects of ELS; (2)
               the amygdala is particularly sensitive to early ELS; and (3)
               several deficits, particularly those in the affective domain,
               appear to persist years after ELS has ceased and may increase
               risk for later psychopathology.",

               on body image concerns of young adult women in the U.S., there

               processes and effects of social media on young women's body
               image and self-perceptions. Yet given the heavy online presence
               of young adults, particularly women, and their reliance on

               media can influence perceptions of body image and body image

               theories, the present article articulates a series of ideas and
               a framework to guide research on social media effects on body
               image concerns of young adult women. The interactive format and

               presence and exchange of a multitude of visual images, suggest

              related to orthorexia nervosa. The purpose of the present study
              was to validate the Polish version of the ORTHO-15 test. METHODS:
              341 women and 59 men (N = 400) were recruited, whose age ranged
              from 18 to 35 years. Mean age was 23.09 years (SD = 3.14) in
              women and 24.02 years (SD = 3.87) in men. The ORTHO-15 test and
              the EAT-26 test were used in the present study. RESULTS: Factor
              analysis (exploratory and confirmatory analysis) was used in the
              present study. Exploratory factor analysis performed on the
              initial 15 items from a random split half of the study group
              suggested a nine-item two-factor structure. Confirmatory factor
              analysis performed on the second randomly selected half of the
              study group supported this two-factor structure of the ORTHO-15
              test. The Polish version of the ORTHO-15 test demonstrated an
              internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) equal to 0.644.
              CONCLUSION: The Polish version of the ORTHO-15 test is a reliable
              and valuable instrument to assess obsessive attitudes related to

              eating) is a poorly defined disordered eating behavior that
              results from a pathological obsession with food, its purported
              nutritional value, composition, origin, etc. METHODS: We
              investigated the prevalence of ON in a local ashtanga yoga
              community, by using a validated questionnaire (ORTO-15) that sets
              a threshold of ON diagnosis at $\leq$40. RESULTS: Among the 136
              respondents, the mean ORTO-15 score (which was normally
              distributed) was 35.27 $\pm$ 3.69, i.e., 86 \% of respondents had
              an ORTO-15 score lower than 40 and no significant association
              with age or BMI was recorded. When we analyzed the differential
              distribution of orthorexia in our cohort, we recorded an
              association of ORTO-15 score and vegetarianism, i.e., the ORTO-15
              score was lower among vegetarians. CONCLUSIONS: The results of
              this pilot study should suggest ashtanga yoga teachers to avoid
              excessive reference to a healthy diet, which is natural component
              of yoga practice.",

              prescribed), appearance orientation, overweight preoccupation,

              styles. Higher orthorexic tendencies also correlated with lower
              scores for body areas satisfaction and a secure attachment style.
              There was no significant correlation between orthorexia nervosa
              and self-esteem. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed
              that overweight preoccupation, appearance orientation and the

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: Social media use is ever increasing amongst young
               adults and has previously been shown to have negative effects on
               body image, depression, social comparison, and disordered
               eating. One eating disorder of interest in this context is
               orthorexia nervosa, an obsession with eating healthily. High
               orthorexia nervosa prevalence has been found in populations who
               take an active interest in their health and body and is
               frequently comorbid with anorexia nervosa. Here, we investigate
               links between social media use, in particularly Instagram and
               orthorexia nervosa symptoms. METHODS: We conducted an online
               survey of social media users (N = 680) following health food
               accounts. We assessed their social media use, eating behaviours,
               and orthorexia nervosa symptoms using the ORTO-15 inventory.
               RESULTS: Higher Instagram use was associated with a greater
               tendency towards orthorexia nervosa, with no other social media
               channel having this effect. In exploratory analyses Twitter
               showed a small positive association with orthorexia symptoms.
               BMI and age had no association with orthorexia nervosa. The
               prevalence of orthorexia nervosa among the study population was
               49\%, which is significantly higher than the general population
               (<1\%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the healthy eating
               community on Instagram has a high prevalence of orthorexia
               symptoms, with higher Instagram use being linked to increased
               symptoms. These findings highlight the implications social media
               can have on psychological wellbeing, and the influence social
               media 'celebrities' may have over hundreds of thousands of
               individuals. These results may also have clinical implications

              associated with enhanced neuropeptide Y (NPY) activity within the
              hypothalamus may operate in part by interacting antagonistically
              with other neural processes responsive to serotonin
              (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT). To test this possibility further,
              experiments were performed to determine if the magnitude of
              feeding produced by injecting NPY into the paraventricular
              nucleus (PVN) or the perifornical hypothalamus (PFH) was
              diminished by coinjections of 5-HT into these two sites or
              peripheral injections of the 5-HT agonist, d-fenfluramine. Adult
              male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted unilaterally with
              stainless steel cannulae aimed to terminate either in the PVN or
              the PFH. In both studies, NPY (235 pmol) produced significant
              feeding in both sites either 1 or 2 h after injection when
              compared to saline. This enhanced feeding response was
              significantly greater in the PFH 2 h after injection (40\% in the
              central study; 70\% in the peripheral study). Coinjection of 5-HT
              (6.3, 12.5, or 25.0 nmol) into either site had no effect on the
              induction of this NPY-induced feeding response. However,
              peripherally injected d-fenfluramine (0.32, 0.63, or 1.25 mg/kg)
              produced strong dose-dependent attenuation both 1- and 2-h food
              intake elicited by 235 pmol NPY in either site, with the PFH
              being proportionately more sensitive to this effect. Viewed
              together, these results suggest that the feeding-suppressant
              effects of systemic fenfluramine on hypothalamic NPY-induced
              feeding may operate largely via peripheral mechanisms and/or
              central ones that have little to do with its 5-HT agonistic
              effects within the PVN or PFH.",

              Wistar rats were given fenfluramine (10 mg/kg, n = 7) or saline
              (n = 7), intraperitoneally 1 h before darkness. Food was

  title    = "Determinants of compliance with iron supplementation: supplies,
              side effects, or psychology?",
  author   = "Galloway, R and McGuire, J",
  abstract = "Iron deficiency anemia affects over 2 billion people.
              Particularly at risk are pregnant women and young children.
              Although distribution of iron supplements is practised in many
              antenatal care programs in developing countries, it has often
              been alleged that pregnant women do not take them. Poor
              compliance arises not only because of patient behavior but also
              from factors out of the patient's control. This paper presents
              the results of a review of the literature on medical compliance
              to determine whether iron supplementation is different from other
              medications, to assess the known levels of compliance, and to
              synthesize recommendations for improving compliance relevant to
              iron supplementation. The review showed that compliance with iron
              therapy is a specific case of medical compliance. Reasons for
              non-compliance with iron deficiency treatment include: inadequate
              program support (lack of political commitment and financial
              support); insufficient service delivery (poor provider-user
              dynamics; lack of supplies, access, training, and motivation of
              health care professionals); and patient factors (misunderstanding
              instructions, side effects, frustration about the frequency and
              number of pills taken, migration, fear of having big babies,
              personal problems, nausea that accompanies pregnancy, and the
              subtlety of anemia which makes demand for treatment low). Much
              has been made about the side effects (nausea, constipation, etc.)
              that women might experience during iron therapy as the cause of
              poor compliance with iron supplementation without justification
              according to this review. Instead, unavailability of iron
              supplements was the most common reason why women did not take
              iron supplements. Women bear a disproportionate burden from iron
              deficiency anemia even though the technology exists to address
              the problem at low cost. Governments and health care
              professionals must renew their commitment to iron therapy by
              monitoring and improving compliance. We can significantly improve
              compliance by: making sure that iron supplements are available at
              all times; providing advanced warning about the possibility of
              side effects; involving the patient in the therapeutic strategy;
              and providing reminders, such as posters and calendars, about
              taking supplements.",

              intake, may interact to control energy homoeostasis. We therefore
              investigated the effects of fluoxetine, which inhibits serotonin
              reuptake, on food intake and the activity of the neuropeptide
              Yergic arcuato-paraventricular projection in lean Wistar and

              which obesity is postulated to be due to overactivity of the
              arcuato-paraventricular projection. Fluoxetine significantly
              reduced food intake in lean and obese rats, both during
              continuous subcutaneous infusion and (10 mg/kg/day for seven
              days) and acutely after a single injection (10 mg/kg). Fluoxetine
              also significantly reduced neuropeptide Y levels in the
              paraventricular nucleus, a major site of neuropeptide Y release
              which is highly sensitive to the appetite-stimulating actions of
              neuropeptide Y. Push-pull sampling in lean and fatty Zucker rats
              showed that neuropeptide Y secretion in the paraventricular
              nucleus was significantly reduced after acute fluoxetine
              treatment. Furthermore, seven days fluoxetine treatment prevented
              the significant increases in hypothalamic neuropeptide Y
              messenger RNA which were induced in lean rats by food restriction
              which precisely matched the hypophagia induced by the drug. We
              conclude that fluoxetine inhibits various aspects of the activity
              of the neuropeptide Yergic arcuato-paraventricular neurons, and
              suggest that reduced neuropeptide Y release in the
              paraventricular nucleus may mediate, at least in part, the drug's
              hypophagic action. We further suggest that serotonin may
              influence food intake and energy balance by inhibiting the
              arcuato-paraventricular projection, and that the two
              neurotransmitters may act together to regulate feeding and energy
              homoeostasis.",

              an integrated luminosity of 273 nb−1, 734 events, that is about

               targets. The second wave was characterized by similar direct
               change efforts guided by social learning and cognitive
               principles that included cognitive in addition to behavioral and
               emotive targets. Various factors seem to have set the stage for

               philosophical changes. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
               is one of a number of new interventions from both behavioral and
               cognitive wings that seem to be moving the field in a different

               characterized by openness to older clinical traditions, a focus
               on second order and contextual change, an emphasis of function
               over form, and the construction of flexible and effective
               repertoires, among other features. They build on the first- and

              disorder in which the person is excessively preoccupied with
              healthy food. First described by Bratman in 1997, ON entails a
              fixation on healthy food or a health food dependence. The term
              orthorexia nervosa arises from the Greek words orthos (=accurate)
              and orexis (=hunger) meaning obsession with healthy food and
              proper nutrition. Fears and worries about health, eating, and the
              quality of food are significant. Objectives We investigated the
              prevalence of ON in a a population of young Italian adults by
              using a validated questionnaire (ORTO-15). Aims We aimed to
              assess the prevalence of ON in a large sample of general
              population and to identify some possible specific correlation
              such as gender and Body Mass Index (BMI). Methods 1453 adult
              subjects from the general population were administered the
              ORTO-15 test and investigated for gender, age and BMI.
              Statistical analyses were performed referring to diagnostic
              threshold (40). Results Orthorexia had a 10,9\% prevalence in our
              sample, with a female prevalence statistically significant
              (female vs male= 72,8\% vs 27,2\%). Moreover, age and Body Mass
              Index did not seem to be significant factors. Conclusions ON is
              not currently considered as a full-fledged and discrete mental
              disorder. Again, the definition and diagnostic criteria of ON
              remain unclear. Further studies are needed to clarify appropriate
              diagnostic methods and the place of ON among psychopathological
              categories. This should be accompanied by a vigorous research
              effort aimed at understanding the core nature of this condition.",

              research, which reached out to the entire 318 MD. The ORTO-15

              verify the prevalence of ON. Those subjects who were classified
              below 40 from the ORTO-15 test are accepted to have ON.
              Chi-square test, ANOVA (univariate) analysis and logistic
              regression were used for analyses of the data. Mean score of the
              participants from the ORTO-15 test is 39.8+/-0.22, and there is
              no statistical difference between women and men. A total of
              45.5\% of the residence MD involved in the research scored below
              40 in the ORTO-15 test. Those who do their food shopping
              themselves, skip a meal with a salad/fruit, care about the
              quality of the things they eat, think that eating outside is
              healthy, look at the content of what they eat and the content of
              food is important in selection of a product score lower in their
              average marks in ORTO-15 and the difference among the groups is

              mass-media. The difference between the groups is statistically
              significant (p<0.05). Female medical doctors are more careful
              than men of their physical appearance and weight control and
              consume less caloric food, which is statistically significant.
              Since those who exhibit ``healthy fanatic'' eating habits may
              have a risk of ON in the future, it would be useful to conduct

              with other mental disorders including depression, suicidal
              behavior, and substance abuse. In an effort to elucidate the
              neurobiological underpinnings of impulsive aggression and to help
              account for its connections with these other disorders, this
              paper reviews relevant biochemical, brain imaging, and genetic
              studies. The review suggests that dysfunctional interactions
              between serotonin and dopamine systems in the prefrontal cortex
              may be an important mechanism underlying the link between
              impulsive aggression and its comorbid disorders. Specifically,
              serotonin hypofunction may represent a biochemical trait that
              predisposes individuals to impulsive aggression, with dopamine
              hyperfunction contributing in an additive fashion to the
              serotonergic deficit. The current paper proposes a modified
              diathesis-stress model of impulsive aggression in which the
              underlying biological diathesis may be deficient serotonergic
              function in the ventral prefrontal cortex. This underlying
              disposition can be manifested behaviorally as impulsive
              aggression towards oneself and others, and as depression under
              precipitating life stressors. Substance abuse associated with
              impulsive aggression is understood in the context of dopamine
              dysregulation resulting from serotonergic deficiency. Also

              with 10 mg/kg fluoxetine for 12-23 days. In the first experiment,
              body weight and vaginal smears were monitored daily. Fluoxetine
              treatment reduced body weight within the first 24 h of treatment.
              Fluoxetine treatment also elongated the estrous cycle, reduced
              blood levels of progesterone, and eliminated lordosis behavior.
              In the second experiment, body weight and food intake were
              examined and a pair-fed group was included to determine if
              fluoxetine-induced anorexia contributed to the disturbance of the
              estrous cycle. In pair-fed rats, effects similar to fluoxetine
              treatment were present. These results lead to the suggestion that
              fluoxetine's anorectic properties could disrupt the female's
              normal endocrine cyclicity and that this disruption could be
              relevant to the reduction in sexual behavior and motivation.
              However, when the duration of fluoxetine treatment was extended
              beyond 16 to 17 days, fluoxetine-treated female rats reinitiated
              vaginal cyclicity and showed evidence of normal sexual

              counterparts remained disrupted. Thus, restricted food intake
              appears to contribute to the disruption of the estrous cycle and
              elimination of sexual receptivity during fluoxetine treatment.
              However, compensatory changes in the serotonergic system that are
              associated with chronic fluoxetine administration may contribute

              compared the HIS with three tools that reflect its key areas:
              physical impact (Pregnancy Unique Quantification of Emesis--PUQE
              score and markers of severity of HG), psychological impact
              (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score--HADS) and social impact
              (SF12 quality of life score). SETTING: A large regional referral,
              women and children's hospital in the North West of England.
              PARTICIPANTS: The HIS was evaluated on 50 women admitted to
              hospital with HG and 50 women recruited from ante-natal clinic
              without severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and with an
              uncomplicated pregnancy. RESULTS: Good criterion validity was
              demonstrated by strong significant correlations with all three
              scores (PUQE, r=0.75, p<0.001, HADS, depression r=0.76, p<0.001,
              and SF12, mental component r=-0.65, p<0.001). The HIS showed good
              internal consistency, Cronbach alpha 0.87, split half 0.80.
              CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence for the validity and reliability
              of the HIS to assess the impact of the physical and psychosocial
              symptoms of HG. Further research is currently underway to
              establish the clinical utility of the HIS questionnaire in the
              care of women hospitalised with HG.",

              impact: accommodation and burden. The current study describes the
              scale's development and preliminary validation. Methods One
              hundred thirty-four adults, identifying as the relative of
              someone with problematic hoarding (n=102) or normative collecting
              behavior (n=32), completed the FISH alongside measures of
              hoarding severity, burden, functional impairment, and quality of
              life (QoL). Exploratory factor analysis (FA) was used to examine
              the scale's factor structure. Internal consistency, known-groups
              and convergent validity were also investigated. Results FA
              supported two factors, accounting for 65.43\% of variance. Of the
              scale items, 16 were determined to load onto these factors. Items
              that did not load were omitted. The revised scale accounted for
              67.41\% of variance and was characterized by good internal
              consistency ($\alpha$=0.86). This measure also differentiated
              between study groups and demonstrated strong correlations with
              measures of severity and burden. Regression indicated the FISH
              better predicted group membership than existing measures of
              burden, impairment or quality of life. Discussion The FISH is a
              promising measure of family impact in the context of (HD). Its
              psychometric properties and utility in monitoring outcomes of
              caregiver-based interventions should be investigated further.",

              idea that one's body is insufficiently lean and muscular and
              considered as a body image disorder in men. This study aimed to
              investigate the relationship of MD with childhood bullying
              victimization experiences and mental health problems in a
              nonclinical sample of male bodybuilders. Design A cross-sectional
              study was conducted with a sample of 100 male bodybuilders.
              Methods Participants completed a questionnaire battery consisting
              of the muscle dysmorphic inventory (MDI), and scales on childhood
              bullying victimization, self-esteem, and psychological problems
              including depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive (OC)
              symptoms. Results High scores on the MDI and bullying
              victimization in childhood predicted global psychopathology and
              low self-esteem. Psychological functioning and self-esteem were
              most strongly adversely affected if the men were victims of
              bullying and scored high on the MDI (significant moderation
              effect). Structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses furthermore
              found an indirect linkage of victimization with global
              psychopathology and self-esteem via MDI (mediation effect).
              Conclusions Childhood bullying victimization and MD are strongly
              associated with concurrent anxiety, depressive and

  abstract = "The Behavioral Satiety Sequence (BSS) is the name given to the
              orderly transitions of eating, activity grooming and resting
              measured during the postingestive period. Because the BSS is
              considered to reflect the operations of natural physiological
              processes underlying satiety, the sequence can be used to
              discriminate between different drugs (and other manipulations)
              that reduce food intake via these natural physiological
              mechanisms or those that do so by interference. The BSS is only
              produced by the presence of a caloric load in the gut, and the
              preabsorptive satiety factors (such as CCK) the caloric load
              triggers. The BSS is most accurately defined by continuous
              observation rather than time or event sampling techniques
              [Partial Time Sampling (PTS) or Momentary Time Sampling (MTS)].
              Continuous observation also allows the true duration and true
              frequency of each behavior to be analyzed. Continuous observation
              can be used to determine if the profiles associated with the
              reduction in food intake is caused by nausea, sedation,
              hyperactivity, or altered palatability of food. At the present
              time is it possible to identify a number of drugs whose
              suppression of food intake is associated with the disruption or
              preservation of the BSS. Drugs that increase synaptic 5-HT
              activity such d-fenfluramine, fluoxetine. and sibutramine all
              preserve the BSS and advance the onset of resting. The 5-HT1b/2c
              agonists mCPP and TFMPP and the 5-HT1b agonist CP-94,253 produce
              similar effects. However, the 5-HT2 agonist DOI and the 5-HT1a/1b
              agonist RU-24969 disrupt the BSS by inducing hyperactivity as
              does amphetamine. The 5-HT2 agonist MK-212 disrupts the BSS by
              inducing sedation. Selective dopamine agonists, at low doses,
              such as SKF-38393 (DA1) and LY-171555 (DA2) also preserve the
              BSS. However, detailed behavioral analysis of the effects of many

              clinical trials of fluoxetine reinforced this agent's more
              favorable adverse-event profile compared with tricyclic
              antidepressants (TCAs). OBJECTIVES: The present meta-analysis
              sought to provide a reanalysis of updated adverse-event and
              discontinuation data for fluoxetine 20 to 80 mg/d compared with
              TCAs and placebo in the treatment of major depressive disorder
              (MDD) in adults. A subanalysis to assess the safety profile of
              the most commonly used effective dose of fluoxetine in MDD (20
              mg) was also conducted. METHODS: Data were obtained from 25
              double-blind clinical trials involving 4016 patients with MDD
              randomized to treatment with fluoxetine 20 to 80 mg/d, TCAs, or
              placebo. The subanalysis included data from 6 trials involving
              1258 patients treated with fixed 20-mg doses of fluoxetine or
              placebo. Spontaneously reported treatment-emergent adverse
              events, reasons for discontinuation, and events leading to
              discontinuation were compared between groups. RESULTS: The age of
              the 4016 randomized patients ranged from 12 to 90 years, with a
              mean age of 46 years. Most patients were white (92\%), and 62\%
              were female. The age of the 1258 patients in the 20-mg fixed-dose
              population ranged from 18 to 90 years, with a mean age of 54
              years; as in the total population, most of these patients were
              white (92\%), and 57\% were female. The adverse-event profiles of
              fluoxetine and TCAs in these trials were consistent with the
              typical profiles of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and
              TCAs. At a dose of 20 mg/d, fluoxetine-treated patients had a
              discontinuation rate due to adverse events that was not
              statistically significantly different from that in placebo
              recipients. Discontinuation rates due to lack of efficacy were
              not significantly different between fluoxetine and TCAs. However,
              significantly more TCA-treated patients discontinued therapy
              because of adverse events and significantly fewer completed
              treatment compared with fluoxetine-treated patients (both, P or =
              2\%) leading to discontinuation were asthenia, dizziness,
              insomnia, nausea, nervousness, somnolence, and tremor in
              fluoxetine-treated patients and abnormal vision, agitation,
              constipation, dizziness, dry mouth, headache, nausea,
              nervousness, rash, somnolence, sweating, and tremor in
              TCA-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this large series of
              clinical trials confirm that fluoxetine is well tolerated in the
              acute treatment of MDD in adults, especially at a dosage of 20
              mg/d, and is better tolerated than the recommended doses of TCAs.",

               significantly more often in bupropion SR-treated patients than
               in patients who received placebo (P<0.05). Nearly all (94\% to
               99\%) adverse events reported in these studies were mild or
               moderate. Less than 10\% of patients in either group

               and no deaths or serious drug-related adverse events were
               reported. Sexual dysfunction was reported as an adverse event by
               <1\% of patients in either group. Bupropion SR was associated
               with dose-related weight loss in all 3 studies. No consistent
               patterns of change were observed in vital signs or in the

              40\%-50\% recovery rate. Most of these reviews have focused on
              reductions of binge eating and purging; however, the cognitive

  author   = "Vaswani, Meera and Linda, Farzana Kadar and Ramesh, Subramanyam",
  abstract = "The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have emerged
              as a major therapeutic advance in psychopharmacology. As a
              result, the discovery of these agents marks a milestone in
              neuropsychopharmacology and rational drug design, and has
              launched a new era in psychotropic drug development. Prior to the
              SSRIs, all psychotropic medications were the result of chance
              observation. In an attempt to develop a SSRI, researchers
              discovered a number of nontricyclic agents with amine-uptake
              inhibitory properties, acting on both noradrenergic and
              serotonergic neurons with considerable differences in potency. A
              given drug may affect one or more sites over its clinically
              relevant dosing range and may produce multiple and different
              clinical effects. The enhanced safety profile includes a reduced
              likelihood of pharmacodynamically mediated adverse drug-drug
              interactions by avoiding affects on sites that are not essential
              to the intended outcome. SSRIs were developed for inhibition of
              the neuronal uptake pump for serotonin (5-HT), a property shared
              with the TCAs, but without affecting the other various
              neuroreceptors or fast sodium channels. The therapeutic mechanism
              of action of SSRIs involves alteration in the 5-HT system. The
              plethora of biological substrates, receptors and pathways for
              5-HT are candidates to mediate not only the therapeutic actions
              of SSRIs, but also their side effects. A hypothesis to explain
              these immediate side effects is that 5-HT is increased at
              specific 5-HT receptor subtypes in discrete regions of the body
              where the relevant physiologic processes are regulated. Marked
              differences exist between the SSRIs with regard to effects on
              specific cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, and thus the likelihood
              of clinically important pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions.
              Although no clear relationship exists between the clinical
              efficacy, plasma concentration of SSRIs, nor any threshold that
              defines toxic concentrations, but therapeutic drug monitoring
              (TDM) may be useful in special populations, such as in elderly
              patients, poor metabolizers (PM) of sparteine (CYP2D6) or
              mephenytoin (CYP2C19), and patients with liver and kidney
              impairment. Several meta-analyses have reviewed the comparative
              efficacy of TCAs and SSRIs, and concluded that both TCAs and
              SSRIs have similar efficacy in the treatment of depression. SSRIs
              have demonstrated better efficacy and tolerability in the
              treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). They have also
              been found to be effective in the treatment for social anxiety
              disorder both in reducing total levels of social anxiety and in
              improving overall clinical condition. The benefit of SSRIs in
              anorexia nervosa (AN) is apparently short-term unless medication
              is given in the context of nutritional or behavioral therapy. No
              single antidepressant can ever be recommended for every patient,
              but in a vast majority of patients, SSRIs should be considered as
              one of the first-line drugs in the treatment of depression.",

               Boomsma, D I",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Until recently, hoarding was considered an
               obsessive-compulsive symptom (OCS). However, current evidence
               suggests that these two phenotypes may be clinically, and
               perhaps etiologically, distinct. Both hoarding and OCS have a
               genetic etiology, but the degree of unique and shared genetic
               contributions to these phenotypes has not been well studied.
               METHOD: Prevalence rates were assessed for hoarding and OCS in a
               sample of adult twin pairs (n = 7906 twins) and their family
               members from The Netherlands Twin Register (total sample =
               15,914). Using Mplus, genetic analyses using liability threshold
               models were conducted for both phenotypes, for their
               co-morbidity, and for specific hoarding symptoms (cluttering,
               discarding and acquiring). RESULTS: Of the total sample, 6.7\%
               met criteria for clinically significant hoarding; endorsement of
               all three hoarding symptoms was > or = 79\%. Men had slightly
               higher rates than women. Also, 5.7\% met criteria for clinically
               significant OCS; rates were similar in males and females.
               Genetic factors accounted for 36\% of the variance for hoarding
               and 40\% of the variance for OCS. The genetic correlation
               between hoarding and OCS was 0.10. There was no evidence of
               sex-specific genetic contributions for hoarding or OCS. There
               was evidence for a genetic contribution to all hoarding symptom
               subtypes. Only cluttering showed evidence of a contribution from
               the shared environment. CONCLUSIONS: OCS and hoarding are common
               in this population-based sample, have prevalence rates similar
               to those previously reported, and show significant heritability.
               Genetic factors contributed to the co-morbidity of both traits,
               although the genetic correlation between them was low.",

               therapy (CBT) because it describes and explains clients'
               presentations in ways that inform interventions. Yet the
               evidence base challenges the claimed benefits of case
               conceptualization. This paper reviews the rationale and evidence
               base for case conceptualization and outlines a new approach that
               uses the metaphor of a case conceptualization crucible in which
               a client's particular history, experience and strengths are
               synthesized with theory and research to produce an original and
               unique account of clients' presenting issues. The crucible
               metaphor illustrates three key defining principles of case
               conceptualization. First, heat drives chemical reactions in a
               crucible. In our model, collaborative empiricism between
               therapist and client provides the heat. Second, like the
               chemical reaction in a crucible, conceptualization develops over
               time. Typically, it begins at more descriptive levels, later a
               conceptualization incorporates explanatory elements and, if
               necessary, it develops further to include a longitudinal
               explanation of how pre-disposing and protective factors
               influence client issues. Finally, new substances formed in a
               crucible are dependent on the chemical characteristics of the
               materials put into it. Rather than simply look at client
               problems, our model incorporates client strengths at every stage
               of the conceptualization process to more effectively alleviate
               client distress and promote resilience.",

  author   = "Korinth, Anne and Schiess, Sonja and Westenhoefer, Joachim",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Sometimes the suspicion is put forward that nutrition
              students show more disordered eating patterns, which may be among
              the motivating factors to study nutrition. At the same time, it
              is not clear whether the students' increasing knowledge about
              diet and nutrition is associated with a more healthy eating
              behaviour or with an unhealthy obsession with food choices.
              DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparison of nutrition students from
              German universities during the first year of their studies (n
              123) and during higher semesters (n 96), with a control group
              from other study programmes (n 68 and n 46, respectively).
              Dietary restraint, disinhibition, the tendency towards orthorexia
              nervosa and healthy food choices were assessed using a
              questionnaire. RESULTS: Nutrition students showed higher levels
              of dietary restraint than the control group. Disinhibition and
              orthorexia nervosa did not differ between nutrition students and
              controls. Orthorexic tendencies were lower in the more advanced
              nutrition students. Healthy food choices did not differ among
              students in the first year. More advanced nutrition students
              showed healthier food choices, whereas the corresponding controls
              showed slightly more unhealthy food choices. CONCLUSIONS:
              Nutrition students, more than other students, tend to restrict
              their food intake in order to control their weight, but they do
              not have more disturbed or disordered eating patterns than other
              students. Moreover, during the course of their studies, they
              adopt slightly more healthy food choices and decrease their
              tendency to be obsessive in their eating behaviour.",

               for internal consistency was found for symptom ratings relevant

               Support was found for the content validity as well as the

  abstract = "For obese individuals, successful weight loss and maintenance are
              notoriously difficult. Traditional drug development fails to
              exploit knowledge of the psychological factors that crucially
              influence appetite, concentrating instead on restrictive criteria
              of intake and weight reduction, allied to a mechanistic view of
              energy regulation. Drugs are under development that may produce
              beneficial changes in appetite expression in the obese. These
              currently include glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs such as
              liraglutide, an amylin analog davalintide, the 5-HT(2C) receptor
              agonist lorcaserin, the monoamine re-uptake inhibitor
              tesofensine, and a number of combination therapies such as
              pramlintide and metreleptin, bupropion and naltrexone,
              phentermine and topiramate, and bupropion and zonisamide.
              However, the effects of these treatments on eating behavior
              remain poorly characterized. Obesity is typically a consequence
              of overconsumption driven by an individual's natural sensitivity
              to food stimuli and the pleasure derived from eating.
              Intuitively, these processes should be effective targets for
              pharmacotherapy, and behavioral analysis can identify drugs that
              selectively affect desire to eat, enjoyment of eating, satiation
              or postmeal satiety. Rational interventions designed specifically
              to modulate these processes could limit the normally aversive
              consequences of caloric restriction and maximize an individual's
              capacity to successfully gain control over their appetite.",

              assessing the effects of chronic fluoxetine treatment on NPY and
              orexin immunostaining in several hypothalamic regions. RESEARCH
              METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Male obese Zucker (fa/fa) rats were
              administered fluoxetine (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally) daily for 2
              weeks. The control group was administered 0.9\% NaCl solution.
              Carcass composition was assessed using the official methods of
              the Association of Official Analytical Chemists. To test the
              potential thermogenic effect of fluoxetine administration, total
              body oxygen consumption was measured daily for 60 minutes before
              fluoxetine or saline injection and for 30 minutes after drug or
              saline injection. Hypothalamic arcuate and paraventricular
              nuclei, and the lateral hypothalamic area were immunostained for
              NPY, orexin A, and orexin B. Commercial kits were used for serum
              determinations. RESULTS: Chronic fluoxetine administration in
              obese Zucker rats generated a reduction in body weight gain, food
              intake, adipocyte size, fat mass, and body protein. A decrease in
              NPY immunostaining in the paraventricular nucleus, without
              changes in the arcuate, was observed. However, no changes were
              observed in the number of neural cells immunostained for orexin A
              or orexin B in the lateral hypothalamic area. DISCUSSION: Due to
              the hyperphagic effect of NPY in the paraventricular nucleus,
              these results suggest that NPY, but not orexins, could be
              involved in the anorexigenic effect of fluoxetine in obese Zucker

              memory T cells in humans with the potential to recognize

              (nucleocapsid protein, NP) and non-structural (NSP-7 and NSP13 of
              ORF1) regions of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 convalescents (n=36). In
              all of them we demonstrated the presence of CD4 and CD8 T cells
              recognizing multiple regions of the NP protein. We then showed
              that SARS-recovered patients (n=23) still possess long-lasting
              memory T cells reactive to SARS-NP 17 years after the 2003
              outbreak, which displayed robust cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2
              NP. Surprisingly, we also frequently detected SARS-CoV-2 specific
              T cells in individuals with no history of SARS, COVID-19 or
              contact with SARS/COVID-19 patients (n=37). SARS-CoV-2 T cells in
              uninfected donors exhibited a different pattern of
              immunodominance, frequently targeting the ORF-1-coded proteins
              NSP7 and 13 as well as the NP structural protein. Epitope
              characterization of NSP7-specific T cells showed recognition of

              non-pharmaceutical interventions have suppressed the local
              outbreak of this disease1. Here we use a modelling approach to
              reconstruct the full-spectrum dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan
              between 1 January and 8 March 2020 across 5 periods defined by
              events and interventions, on the basis of 32,583
              laboratory-confirmed cases1. Accounting for presymptomatic
              infectiousness2, time-varying ascertainment rates, transmission
              rates and population movements3, we identify two key features of
              the outbreak: high covertness and high transmissibility. We
              estimate 87\% (lower bound, 53\%) of the infections before 8
              March 2020 were unascertained (potentially including asymptomatic
              and mildly symptomatic individuals); and a basic reproduction
              number (R0) of 3.54 (95\% credible interval 3.40-3.67) in the
              early outbreak, much higher than that of severe acute respiratory
              syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)4,5.
              We observe that multipronged interventions had considerable
              positive effects on controlling the outbreak, decreasing the
              reproduction number to 0.28 (95\% credible interval 0.23-0.33)
              and-by projection-reducing the total infections in Wuhan by
              96.0\% as of 8 March 2020. We also explore the probability of
              resurgence following the lifting of all interventions after 14
              consecutive days of no ascertained infections; we estimate this
              probability at 0.32 and 0.06 on the basis of models with 87\% and
              53\% unascertained cases, respectively-highlighting the risk
              posed by substantial covert infections under changing control
              measures. These results have important implications when
              considering strategies of continuing surveillance and

              were based on group therapy and were supervised by a dietitian

              The VLCD periods were the same. RESULTS: There was no evidence
              that a more intensive treatment promotes a larger weight
              reduction. Weight reduction after 1 y: group 1, -7.6 (+/-0.97)

              kg, BMI -3.0 (+/-0.3) kg/m(2). The dropout rate was 26\%.

               seasonal affective disorder, premenstrual syndrome, and some

               Additionally, unipolar depressed individuals increase their
               preference for sweet carbohydrate/fat rich foods as they become
               depressed. They also increase their consumption of carbohydrates

               behavioral therapy and selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors
               have shown efficacy in treating these disorders, little is known
               about their relative or combined efficacy. METHODS: In this
               randomized, controlled trial, we assigned 488 children between
               the ages of 7 and 17 years who had a primary diagnosis of
               separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or
               social phobia to receive 14 sessions of cognitive behavioral
               therapy, sertraline (at a dose of up to 200 mg per day), a
               combination of sertraline and cognitive behavioral therapy, or a
               placebo drug for 12 weeks in a 2:2:2:1 ratio. We administered
               categorical and dimensional ratings of anxiety severity and
               impairment at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, and 12. RESULTS: The
               percentages of children who were rated as very much or much
               improved on the Clinician Global Impression-Improvement scale
               were 80.7\% for combination therapy (P<0.001), 59.7\% for
               cognitive behavioral therapy (P<0.001), and 54.9\% for
               sertraline (P<0.001); all therapies were superior to placebo
               (23.7\%). Combination therapy was superior to both monotherapies
               (P<0.001). Results on the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale
               documented a similar magnitude and pattern of response;
               combination therapy had a greater response than cognitive
               behavioral therapy, which was equivalent to sertraline, and all
               therapies were superior to placebo. Adverse events, including
               suicidal and homicidal ideation, were no more frequent in the
               sertraline group than in the placebo group. No child attempted
               suicide. There was less insomnia, fatigue, sedation, and
               restlessness associated with cognitive behavioral therapy than
               with sertraline. CONCLUSIONS: Both cognitive behavioral therapy
               and sertraline reduced the severity of anxiety in children with
               anxiety disorders; a combination of the two therapies had a
               superior response rate. (ClinicalTrials.gov number,

              considered Indigenous people's understandings of mental health
              and provided details on methodology. Five articles from four
              qualitative studies met these criteria. Meta-ethnography was used
              to identify common themes emerging from the original studies.
              Reciprocal translation was used to synthesize the findings to
              provide new interpretations extending beyond those presented in
              the original studies. An overarching theme emerged from the
              synthesis: the dynamic interconnectedness between the
              multi-factorial components of life circumstances. Reciprocal
              translations and synthesis regarding Indigenous understandings of
              mental health and illness resulted in five themes: (i) culture

               suggested that both the formal and informal contexts of
               education are heavily imbued with a ?culture of healthism? which
               places moral obligation and blame on individuals for their

              METHODS: Eating disorder risk was assessed with the Eating
              Attitudes Test (EAT) and body dissatisfaction and perceptual
              attractiveness determined with the Bodybuilder Image Grid (BIG).
              RESULTS: There was a positive correlation (r=.16, p<.01) between
              the EAT and fat dissatisfaction and a negative correlation
              (r=-.14, p<.05) for muscle dissatisfaction, 28\% of the males had

               (1902?1987) was designed to promote openness, growth and change
               in understanding the counseling processes. It is an approach
               which is practical and helpful in education, because it can
               solve some of the problems outside the curriculum faced by
               students. For example it provides a way of understanding and
               solving issues of relationships, emotional development and
               ethical behaviour that seem to be at the root of most of the
               problems in school and society at large. However, it is
               essential to incorporate some accelerating ingredients to inform
               conditions which facilitate growth. These include acceptance,
               empathy and positive regard from others. For example it has been
               realized that if an individual is denied acceptance and positive
               regard they fail to relate the meaning of their experience to
               themselves and positive growth in such a relevant way is
               inhibited. However, the approach is faced with some drawbacks

               very challenging job. It is becoming increasingly difficult to
               establish a classroom environment that is free from disruptive
               behaviour. The person-centred approach, where the student as the
               client is made responsible of his or her own behaviour, could be
               part of the solution. This could be the focus of an educational
               yet assertive discipline program. This paper will discuss the

               the helping relationship, empathy, congruence, unconditional

              to offer in the prevention of eating disorders and child obesity.
              Our paper notes the important contribution of school educators
              whilst warning of the current need to specifically examine how
              teachers and school personnel may be best trained and prepared
              for such a preventive role, whether they currently feel willing
              and able to undertake such a role, and whether some groups of
              teachers may be personally susceptible to body image and eating
              problems. It is vital to understand the knowledge, behaviors,
              attitudes, and expectations of educators implementing prevention
              programs in order to ensure that they are personally and
              professionally capable of carrying out prevention initiatives in
              schools. Individuals involved in food and exercise-related
              careers have been identified as being at environmental and
              situational risk for body image and eating problems, and it may
              be possible that they chose their career path due to their own
              personal experience with eating disorders or weight issues. In
              such cases, specific training or assistance may be required in
              order to enable the educators to conduct effective preventive
              activities. Discussion focuses on what needs to be done in order
              to enable teachers and other school-based educators to perform
              most effectively in the implementation of school based eating
              disorder and child obesity prevention programs.",

              Eating Syndrome the least. Although the majority is familiar with

              more seriously in the sense of ``genuine'' syndromes, which

              Emetophobia appears to be the least ``fashionable'' of the four.

               Specifically, the girls refer to healthism, within which sport
               is seen to provide a means to achieve good health and a slim and

               for doing depth psychotherapy with transgender individuals.
               Combining contemporary psychodynamic, Jungian and gender
               identity theory, this approach reflects the unique path of
               transgender identity development. Transgender identity is not
               viewed as inherently pathological. Rather, the issues that
               emerge in psychotherapy with transgender clients, like with all
               people, are about the self and self-in-relation, negotiating
               identity with outer reality. For the transgender person,
               however, psychological issues are particularly related to faulty
               mirroring during periods of identity construction because the
               transgender self is often invisible to the outside world.
               Transgender identity development involves a body/mind mismatch
               and is affected by social stigma associated with gender
               variance. Transgender individuals negotiate their transgendered
               self in a world that sees gender as binary, resulting in a
               tension between desire, authenticity and avoidance of stigma. A
               composite trajectory of pre-, during- and post-coming out of

              from the needs of the older generation, whereas in Italy it is
              more likely to reflect a cultural preference. Employing data from

              Our findings showed that, in Britain, mothers' health had a
              greater impact on proximity than in Italy, suggesting that the
              needs of the older generation in Britain were important for
              determining proximity. An additional analysis showed that
              children's characteristics were also important in determining
              proximity in Italy, mainly because of delayed adult transitions.
              This supports the hypothesis that intergenerational proximity in

              article explores the findings from focus groups conducted with 63

              understanding whether they are in a good position to support

              recommendations regarding school staff's training needs for

              in semi-structured focus groups. These were transcribed and
              analysed using content analysis principles. Five key themes
              emerged: (i) many staff do not have a basic understanding of
              eating disorders, (ii) eating disorders are taboo in the

  author   = "Shelton, Nicola J",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The role that healthy eating plays in good health is
              well documented. Government policy in Scotland recommends
              reducing salt, refined sugar and saturated fat in the diet and
              increasing the consumption of fruit and vegetables,
              carbohydrates, fibre and oily fish. METHODS: Using data from the
              1998 Scottish Health Survey a composite measure of healthy eating
              behaviour was derived by scoring low levels of consumption of
              salt, refined sugar and saturated fat and higher consumption of
              fruit and vegetables, carbohydrates, fibre and oily fish. This
              paper presents results from logistic regression analysis of the
              risk factors for this measure of healthy eating behaviour.
              RESULTS: Young people, men, those on low income, those without
              qualifications, those who take little exercise, who lack access
              to car, live in deprived areas and women who smoke were less
              likely to show healthy eating behaviour. CONCLUSION: Healthy
              eating reflects dietary policy and guidelines for those with
              higher socio-economic status and who demonstrate other health
              seeking behaviour. Health education policy needs to be targeted
              at young people, men, and those of lower socio-economic status,

               Menstrual cycle phases were determined by the presence of
               menses, ovarian hormonal assays, and basal temperature
               monitoring. Reports of pain, water retention, negative affect,

               or better) in the perimenstruum when compared to the follicular
               and luteal phases. During the perimenstruum, a higher energy
               intake of carbohydrate was associated with higher ratings of
               negative affect (p < .01) and impaired performance/decreased
               activity (p < .05). Lower energy intake of protein was
               associated with higher ratings of well being (p < .05).
               Overeating and dieting behavior were related to greater water
               retention (p < .01), autonomic reactions (p < .05), and appetite

              rated audiotapes of therapy sessions using the working alliance

              included their socioeconomic characteristics, markers of eating
              disorder psychopathology and expectancy of their treatment.
              Baseline scores on the eating disorder examination (EDE) were
              positively correlated with the alliance early in treatment in FBT
              but no patients' characteristics were correlated with the
              alliance in AFT. EDE was a moderator of alliance, with higher

               used therapeutic approach that focuses on helping clients
               construct solutions rather than solve problems. The approach
               evolved in a clinical context amid many anecdotal reports of
               success from both therapists and clients, but it has not been
               subjected to controlled empirical testing until very recently.
               In this article we critically review all of the controlled
               outcome studies of SFBT to date (N = 15) to assess the extent to
               which SFBT has received empirical support. Five studies were
               well-controlled and all showed positive outcomes?four found SFBT
               to be better than no treatment or standard institutional
               services, and one found SFBT to be comparable to a known
               intervention: Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depression (IPT).
               Findings from the remaining 10 studies, which we consider
               moderately or poorly controlled, were consistent with a
               hypothesis of SFBT effectiveness. We conclude that the 15
               studies provide preliminary support for the efficacy of SFBT but
               do not permit a definitive conclusion. Our critique highlights
               areas where methodology in future studies can be strengthened to

              dieting and restrictive eating, abnormal eating behavior, and
              finally clinical eating disorders. The prevalence of eating
              disorders is increased in elite athletes and for this group the
              cause of starting to diet is related to (a) perception of the
              paradigm of appearance in the specific sport, (b) perceived
              performance improvements, and (c) sociocultural pressures for
              thinness or an ``ideal'' body. Athletes most at risk for
              disordered eating are those involved in sports emphasizing a thin
              body size/shape, a high power-to-weight ratio, and/or sports
              utilizing weight categories, such as in some high-intensity
              sports. In addition to dieting, personality factors, pressure to

              sport-specific training, overtraining, injuries, and unfortunate
              coaching behavior, are important risk factors. To prevent
              disordered eating and eating disorders, the athletes have to
              practice healthy eating, and the medical staff of teams and
              parents must be able to recognize symptoms indicating risk for
              eating disorders. Coaches and leaders must accept that disordered
              eating can be a problem in the athletic community and that

              about these problems have stimulated calls for broader
              intervention efforts in schools, actions thus far have been
              limited. This study examined educators' perspectives about
              potential policy actions to address these issues in schools.
              METHODS: Educators (N = 240) completed an online questionnaire
              assessing their support for 11 potential school-based policy
              actions to address weight-related bullying and eating disorders.
              Participants also rated policies according to their feasibility
              and potential for positive impact. RESULTS: Forty-eight percent
              of participants observed weight-related bullying in their school
              and 99\% expressed the importance of intervening in such
              incidents. A large majority (75\%-94\%) supported 8 of the 11
              policies, especially actions requiring school-based health
              curriculum to include content on eating disorder prevention
              (94\%), and addressing weight-bullying through antibullying

              variables associated with FA in an outpatient sample. METHODS:
              The study comprised 228 subjects, namely, 114 patients with OCD
              and 114 family members, assessed before the patients entered a
              12-session cognitive behavioral group therapy program. A
              multivariate linear regression model was used to control for
              confounding factors and to evaluate variables independently
              associated with FA. FA was evaluated using the Family
              Accommodation Scale for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder-Interviewer
              Rated. RESULTS: FA was found to be highly prevalent among family
              members. Two patient factors positively associated with FA were
              OCD severity as measured by the Clinical Global Impressions Scale
              and higher scores on the Obsessions dimension of the
              Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised. Family members'
              characteristics that were positively associated with FA were
              higher scores on the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory - Revised
              hoarding subscale and being the patient's spouse. CONCLUSION: Our
              findings suggest that the early identification of patients and
              family members who could benefit from interventions aimed at
              reducing FA could improve treatment outcomes.",

              Past research has shown that hope and optimism are negatively

              provides guidelines to guide risk assessment, treatment and
              return-to-play decisions. The IOC expert working group introduces
              a broader, more comprehensive term for the condition previously
              known as 'Female Athlete Triad'. The term 'Relative Energy
              Deficiency in Sport' (RED-S), points to the complexity involved
              and the fact that male athletes are also affected. The syndrome
              of RED-S refers to impaired physiological function including, but
              not limited to, metabolic rate, menstrual function, bone health,
              immunity, protein synthesis, cardiovascular health caused by
              relative energy deficiency. The cause of this syndrome is energy
              deficiency relative to the balance between dietary energy intake
              and energy expenditure required for health and activities of
              daily living, growth and sporting activities. Psychological
              consequences can either precede RED-S or be the result of RED-S.
              The clinical phenomenon is not a 'triad' of the three entities of
              energy availability, menstrual function and bone health, but
              rather a syndrome that affects many aspects of physiological
              function, health and athletic performance. This Consensus

              PARTICIPANTS: 271 patients aged 18-70 years without serious
              illness. INTERVENTION: Brief individual behavioural counselling
              based on the stage of change model; time matched nutrition
              education counselling. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self reported
              number of portions of fruit and vegetables eaten per day, plasma
              beta carotene, alpha tocopherol, and ascorbic acid
              concentrations, and 24 hour urinary potassium excretion.
              Assessment at baseline, eight weeks, and 12 months. RESULTS:
              Consumption of fruit and vegetables increased from baseline to 12
              months by 1.5 and 0.9 portions per day in the behavioural and
              nutrition groups (mean difference 0.6 portions, 95\% confidence
              interval 0.1 to 1.1). The proportion of participants eating five
              or more portions a day increased by 42\% and 27\% in the two
              groups (mean difference 15\%, 3\% to 28\%). Plasma beta carotene
              and alpha tocopherol concentrations increased in both groups, but
              the rise in beta carotene was greater in the behavioural group
              (mean difference 0.16 micromol/l, 0.001 micromol/l to 1.34

              the regulation of emotions. We argue that mindfulness has

              depression, and other psychopathologies through the contribution
              of mindfulness to emotional regulation. We consider the unique
              factors that mindfulness meditation brings to the process of
              emotion regulation that may account for its effectiveness. We

              understanding of appropriateness and safety issues concerning

              the dispensing of pediatric ADs using provincial,
              population-based data from Canada. METHODS: Data covering 22 ADs
              were drawn from the Saskatchewan Ministry of Health
              administrative data files in outpatient settings. The data were
              for 9 triennial years from 1983 to 2007, a 24-year period, for
              those aged 0 to 19 in the general population. Descriptive
              analyses were used. RESULTS: In 1983, 5.9 per 1000 population
              aged 0 to 19 were dispensed at least 1 AD; this decreased to 5.1
              per 1000 population in 1989, and then increased to 15.4 per 1000
              population in 2007, with a slower increase after 2004. Both sexes
              were dispensed more ADs from 1989 onwards, with females being the
              heavier users. The rate of AD use increased significantly with
              age, and this trend became more pronounced after 1998. Family
              physicians were the major prescribers and their prescriptions
              significantly increased from 1989 to 2004 and decreased in 2007.
              The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was
              the major reason for the increase. The number of AD scripts per
              patient also increased. CONCLUSIONS: The growth in the prevalence
              of AD use among children and youth was largely caused by the use
              of SSRIs. The possibility of safety issues induced by AD use
              among children and adolescents, and different patterns of
              medication practice, suggest continuing education is warranted.",

              psychotherapeutic interventions require culturally competent
              delivery for ethnoracial minority clients to protect the
              distinctive cultural orientations of these clients. Dominant
              disciplinary conceptualizations of cultural competence are ``kind
              of person'' models that emphasize specialized awareness,
              knowledge, and skills on the part of the practitioner. Even
              within psychology, this approach to cultural competence is
              controversial owing to professional misgivings concerning its
              culturally essentialist assumptions. Unfortunately, alternative
              ``process-oriented'' models of cultural competence emphasize such
              generic aspects of therapeutic interaction that they remain in
              danger of losing sight of culture altogether. Thus, for cultural
              competence to persist as a meaningful construct, an alternative
              approach that avoids both essentialism and generalism must be
              recovered. One means to capture this alternative is to shift
              focus away from culturally competent therapists toward culturally
              commensurate therapies. Indigenous communities in North America

  abstract = "Emotion regulation has been conceptualized as a process by which
              individuals modify their emotional experiences, expressions, and
              physiology and the situations eliciting such emotions in order to
              produce appropriate responses to the ever-changing demands posed
              by the environment. Thus, context plays a central role in emotion
              regulation. This is particularly relevant to the work on emotion
              regulation in psychopathology, because psychological disorders
              are characterized by rigid responses to the environment. However,
              this recognition of the importance of context has appeared
              primarily in the theoretical realm, with the empirical work
              lagging behind. In this review, the author proposes an approach
              to systematically evaluate the contextual factors shaping emotion
              regulation. Such an approach consists of specifying the
              components that characterize emotion regulation and then
              systematically evaluating deviations within each of these
              components and their underlying dimensions. Initial guidelines
              for how to combine such dimensions and components in order to
              capture substantial and meaningful contextual influences are
              presented. This approach is offered to inspire theoretical and
              empirical work that it is hoped will result in the development of

              and their offspring. Micronutrient supplements are recommended
              for pregnant women because of their documented protective effects
              for the offspring, but their potential beneficial effects on
              maternal mental health are unknown. This study investigated the
              association between prenatal micronutrient supplementation and
              the risk for symptoms of postpartum depression in a longitudinal
              pregnancy cohort from the Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and
              Nutrition (APrON) study. METHODS: Participants came from a cohort
              of the first 600 APrON women. Supplemental nutrient intake and
              symptoms of depression (measured with the Edinburgh Postnatal
              Depression Scale (EPDS)) were collected at each trimester and 12
              weeks postpartum. RESULTS: Of the 475 participants who completed
              the EPDS at least twice in pregnancy and at 12 weeks postpartum,
              416 (88\%) scored <10 and 59 (12\%) scored $\geq$10, where an
              EPDS $\geq$10 is considered to be ``at least probable minor
              depression''. Mean nutrient intakes from supplements were higher
              in women with lower EPDS scores, particularly selenium (p =
              0.0015) and omega-3s (p = 0.01). Bivariate analyses showed that
              several demographic and social/lifestyle variables were
              associated with EPDS $\geq$10: not having been born in Canada (p
              = 0.01), greater number of chronic conditions (p = 0.05), greater
              number of stressful life events during this pregnancy (p = 0.02),
              and lower prenatal and postnatal support (p = 0.0043 and p =
              0.0001, respectively). Adjusting for covariates and nutrients
              known to be associated with postpartum depression, logistic
              regression showed that having a prenatal EPDS $\geq$ 10 increased
              the odds of postpartum depressive symptoms (second and third
              trimester OR = 3.29, 95\% CI = 1.55 - 7.01, p = 0.004 and OR =
              4.26, 95\% CI = 2.05 - 8.85, p < 0.0001, respectively), while
              prenatal supplemental selenium (per 10 mcg, OR = 0.76, 95\% CI =
              0.74 - 0.78, p = 0.0019) and postnatal social support (OR = 0.87,
              95\% CI = 0.78 - 0.97, p = 0.0015) were protective. CONCLUSIONS:
              Multiple factors, including supplementary selenium intake, are
              associated with the risk of postpartum depressive symptoms.

              disorders, it is necessary to investigate their subtypes and
              develop specific assessment tools to measure their specific
              symptoms. Orthorexia nervosa is an alleged eating disorder in
              which the person is excessively preoccupied with healthy food.
              The ORTO-15, designed by Donini and colleagues, is the first and
              only at least partially validated instrument to measure this
              construct. The aims of the present study were to examine the
              psychometric properties of its Hungarian adaptation (ORTO-11-Hu),
              and to investigate its relationship to food consumption and
              lifestyle habits in order to contribute to a better description
              of the phenomenon. METHODS: The ORTO-11-Hu, a lifestyle habits
              questionnaire, a food choice list indicating foods the
              participants choose to consume, and ten additional
              orthorexia-related questions were administered to a group of 810
              Hungarian participants (89.4\% female) aged between 20 and 70 (M
              = 32.39 $\pm$ 10.37 years). RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis
              suggested a single factor structure for the 11-item shortened
              version of the instrument. Internal consistency of the measure
              was adequate (Cronbach's alpha = 0.82). No significant
              differences were found between males and females on the
              ORTO-11-Hu. Age and body mass index were significantly associated
              with a tendency towards orthorexia nervosa. Additional
              orthorexia-related features were significantly correlated with
              ORTO-11-Hu scores: orthorexia nervosa tendency was associated not
              only with healthier food choices (eating more whole wheat
              cereals, less white wheat cereals, more fruit and vegetables) but
              with shopping in health food stores, as well as with some healthy
              lifestyle habits (more sports activity, specific dietary
              behaviors, and less alcohol intake). Individuals with higher
              orthorexia nervosa tendency also reported a greater tendency to
              advocate their healthy diet to their friends and family members.
              CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence for the reliability
              of ORTO-11-Hu and some support for the construct validity of the
              instrument. The present study also contributes to the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Nutrition is often a casualty of the busy work day
              for physicians. We aimed to explore physicians' views of their
              nutrition in the workplace including their perceptions of the
              impact of inadequate nutrition upon their personal wellness and
              their professional performance. METHODS: This is a qualitative
              study of a sample of 20 physicians practicing in a large urban
              teaching hospital. Semi-structured open ended interviews were
              conducted to explore physicians' views of workplace nutrition.
              The same physicians had agreed to participate in a related
              nutrition based wellness intervention study that compared
              nutritional intake and cognitive function during a day of usual
              nutrition patterns against another day with scheduled nutrition
              breaks. A second set of interviews was conducted after the
              intervention study to explore how participation in the
              intervention impacted these views. Detailed interview content
              notes were transcribed and analyzed independently with
              differences reconciled by discussion. RESULTS: At initial
              interview, participants reported difficulty accessing adequate
              nutrition at work, linking this deficit with emotional (irritable
              and frustrated), physical (tired and hungry), and cognitive
              (difficulty concentrating and poor decision making) symptoms. In
              addition to identifying practical barriers such as lack of time
              to stop and eat, inconvenient access to food and poor food
              choices, the physicians described how their sense of
              professionalism and work ethic also hinder their work nutrition
              practices. After participating in the intervention, most
              physicians reported heightened awareness of their nutrition
              patterns and intentions to improve their workplace nutrition.
              CONCLUSIONS: Physicians report that inadequate workplace
              nutrition has a significant negative impact on their personal
              wellness and professional performance. Given this threat to
              health care delivery, health care organizations and the medical

              lack sensitivity for some diagnoses and many not be responsive in
              eating disorder patients. This article describes the development
              and validation of a condition-specific QoL measure for
              adolescents and adults with eating disorders--the Eating
              Disorders Quality of Life Scale (EDQLS). METHODS: Multi-source
              and multi-stage methods were used to develop the EDQLS, with
              participation of patients with EDs, their family members and ED
              treatment providers. Sources for domain and item development
              included 39 articles, 12 patient and 10 treatment provider
              interviews, and 31 first person narratives from the internet.
              Four stages of validation and pre-testing involving 17 patients,
              10 family members and 18 providers reduced 233 items to 40 items
              in 12 domains. These items were pilot tested in 41 ED patients.
              RESULTS: The final instrument was then validated in a 12 site
              sample of 171 individuals aged 14-60 with EDs. All items showed
              good dispersion. The total raw mean score was 110 out of 200 (SD
              27.6) with higher scores indicating better QoL. Internal
              consistency was excellent (Cronbach's alpha = .96) and subscale
              internal consistency ranged from alpha .36 to .79 providing
              evidence for a strong overall construct and some
              multi-dimensionality. Validity was supported by significant
              differences in mean EDQLS according to severity levels on the
              EDI-2 (F = 95.3, p <.001) and the BSI (F = 86.9, p <.001). EDQLS
              scores were positively associated with time in treatment (F =
              4.65, p = .01) suggesting responsiveness. A strong positive
              association was also found between EDQLS scores and stage of
              change (F = 15.1 p <.001). Pearson's correlations between the
              EDQLS and criterion instrument scores were .71 for the SF-12
              mental subscale, .61 for the QoLI and .78 for the 16D, supporting
              construct validity. Exploratory principal components and item
              response theory analyses identified only a few poor fitting
              items. CONCLUSION: The EDQLS has promising psychometric

  abstract = "The popularity of natural bodybuilding is increasing; however,
              evidence-based recommendations for it are lacking. This paper
              reviewed the scientific literature relevant to competition
              preparation on nutrition and supplementation, resulting in the
              following recommendations. Caloric intake should be set at a
              level that results in bodyweight losses of approximately 0.5 to
              1\%/wk to maximize muscle retention. Within this caloric intake,
              most but not all bodybuilders will respond best to consuming
              2.3-3.1 g/kg of lean body mass per day of protein, 15-30\% of
              calories from fat, and the reminder of calories from
              carbohydrate. Eating three to six meals per day with a meal
              containing 0.4-0.5 g/kg bodyweight of protein prior and
              subsequent to resistance training likely maximizes any
              theoretical benefits of nutrient timing and frequency. However,
              alterations in nutrient timing and frequency appear to have
              little effect on fat loss or lean mass retention. Among popular
              supplements, creatine monohydrate, caffeine and beta-alanine
              appear to have beneficial effects relevant to contest
              preparation, however others do not or warrant further study. The
              practice of dehydration and electrolyte manipulation in the final
              days and hours prior to competition can be dangerous, and may not
              improve appearance. Increasing carbohydrate intake at the end of
              preparation has a theoretical rationale to improve appearance,
              however it is understudied. Thus, if carbohydrate loading is
              pursued it should be practiced prior to competition and its
              benefit assessed individually. Finally, competitors should be
              aware of the increased risk of developing eating and body image
              disorders in aesthetic sport and therefore should have access to
              the appropriate mental health professionals.",

              is higher in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adolescents
              compared to non-Aboriginal adolescents. Despite this, only a
              small proportion of Aboriginal youth have contact with mental
              health services, possibly due to factors such as remoteness,
              language barriers, affordability and cultural sensitivity issues.
              This research aimed to develop culturally appropriate guidelines
              for anyone who is providing first aid to an Australian Aboriginal
              or Torres Strait Islander adolescent who is experiencing a mental
              health crisis or developing a mental illness. METHODS: A panel of
              Australian Aboriginal people who are experts in Aboriginal youth
              mental health, participated in a Delphi study investigating how
              members of the public can be culturally appropriate when helping
              an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander adolescent with mental
              health problems. The panel varied in size across the three
              sequential rounds, from 37-41 participants. Panellists were
              presented with statements about cultural considerations and
              communication strategies via online questionnaires and were
              encouraged to suggest additional content. All statements endorsed
              as either Essential or Important by $\geq$ 90\% of panel members

              members' satisfaction with the research method, participants were
              invited to provide their feedback after the final survey.
              RESULTS: From a total of 304 statements shown to the panel of
              experts, 194 statements were endorsed. The methodology was found
              to be useful and appropriate by the panellists. CONCLUSION:
              Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Youth mental health experts

              elite sports, especially leanness sports, where control over body
              weight is crucial for high peak performance. Nonetheless, there
              is only a fine line between purely functional behaviour and
              clinically relevant eating disorders. Especially the rapid form
              of weight manipulation seems to foster later eating disorders. So
              far, most studies have focussed on adult athletes and
              concentrated on manifest eating disorders. In contrast, our
              review concentrates on young athletes and weight-control
              behaviour as a risk factor for eating disorders. An electronic
              search according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for
              Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) Statement was performed
              using Pubmed, PsychInfo and Spolit. The following search terms
              were used: weight-control, weight-control behaviour, weight gain,
              weight loss, pathogenic weight-control behaviour and
              weight-concerns, each of them combined with elite athlete, young
              elite athlete, adolescent elite athlete and elite sports.
              Overall, data are inconsistent. In general, athletes do not seem
              to be at a higher risk for pathogenic weight concerns and
              weight-control behaviour. It does seem to be more prevalent in
              leanness sports, though. There is evidence for pathogenic
              weight-control behaviour in both genders; male athletes mostly
              trying to gain weight whereas females emphasise weight reduction.
              There is not enough data to make predictions about connections
              with age of onset. Young elite athletes do show weight-control
              behaviour with varying degrees of frequency and severity. In
              particular, leanness sports seem to be a risk factor for weight
              manipulation. Further research is needed for more details and

              attitudinal body image in ED patients; 2) to identify possible
              predictors of orthorexia nervosa among ED patients. METHODS:
              Fifty-two women diagnosed with EDs were recruited. Patients'
              assessment included the following: the ORTO-15 test (Polish
              version) for orthorexic behaviours; the Eating Attitude Test-26
              (EAT-26) to identify ED symptoms; the Multidimensional Body-Self
              Relations Questionnaire (Polish version) to assess body image.
              RESULTS: A latent class analysis was performed and differences
              between identified classes were assessed. The main differences
              concerned weight, ED pathology and orthorexic behaviours within
              the same group of ED patients. In order to examine predictors of
              orthorexia nervosa, we investigated a structural equation model,
              which excellently fitted to the data ($\chi$(2)(17) = 23.05; p =
              .148; CFI = .962; RMSEA = .08; p = .25; SRMR = .05). In ED
              patients, orthorexic behaviour was negatively predicted by eating
              pathology, weight concern, health orientation and appearance
              orientation. CONCLUSION: The assessment of the orthorexia
              construct in EDs may add to the paucity of studies about this
              issue and may help to clarify the relationship between the two.
              Differences and similarities seem to exist between these
              disorders, and may benefit from specific treatment approaches.

              levels of preoccupation with a healthy food intake (68.55\% women
              and 43.18\% men, respectively). RESULTS: There were no

              engender body image dissatisfaction. To date, most studies have
              demonstrated this relationship between appearance comparison and
              body image dissatisfaction in the context of conventional media
              images depicting the thin-ideal. Social comparison theory posits
              that people are more likely to compare themselves to similar

              anorexia has been well established, little is known about the
              social consequences of ``clean dieting'' and orthorexia nervosa.
              In two studies, we examined the social stigma of clean dieting
              and orthorexia. METHOD: In Study 1, participants read a vignette
              describing a woman following a ``clean'' diet, a woman with
              anorexia, or a control target (minimal information about the
              individual). In Study 2, participants read a vignette describing
              a woman with orthorexia, a woman displaying identical orthorexic
              behaviors but without the orthorexia label, a woman with
              anorexia, or a control target. Participants then rated the target
              individual on a range of measures assessing stereotypes,
              emotions, and behavioral intentions toward the target. RESULTS:
              Study 1 found that the clean-dieting target was evaluated more
              negatively than the control target on some dimensions, but less
              negatively than the target with anorexia nervosa. Study 2 found
              that evaluations of the targets with orthorexia nervosa were more
              negative than evaluations of a control target, but did not differ
              from evaluations of the target with anorexia nervosa. Perceptions
              of the target's control over her behavior were associated with
              more positive evaluations (Studies 1 and 2), whereas perceptions
              of blame and responsibility for the condition were associated
              with more negative evaluations (Study 2). CONCLUSIONS: Overall,
              these findings highlight the potential negative social
              consequences of clean dieting and orthorexia nervosa, and point
              to perceptions of control and blame as potential mechanisms
              underlying the stigma of these conditions.",

              and causal mediation components of Beck's (1967, 1983) cognitive
              theory of depression. DESIGN: In order to allow for a stringent
              test of the aetiological component of Beck's theory, we used a
              short-term longitudinal design in which participants'
              dysfunctional attitudes were assessed prior to the occurrence of
              a negative event. METHODS: In all, 136 high school seniors
              applying to the University of Pennsylvania completed measures of
              depressed mood and dysfunctional attitudes 1-8 weeks before
              receiving their admissions decision (Time 1). The assessment of
              dysfunctional attitudes was preceded by a priming task designed
              to activate latent depressogenic schemata. Participants also
              completed measures of depressed mood, negative views of the self,
              and negative views of the future shortly after they received
              their admissions decision (Time 2) and four days later (Time 3).
              RESULTS: Consistent with the diathesis-stress component of Beck's
              theory, dysfunctional attitudes predicted increases in depressed
              mood immediately following a negative admissions outcome (Time
              2). In addition, consistent with the causal mediation component
              of the theory, in negative outcome students, the relationship
              between dysfunctional attitudes and increases in depressed mood
              was mediated by negative views of the future. Contrary to
              predictions, however, this relationship was not mediated by
              negative views of the self. In addition, contrary to predictions,
              dysfunctional attitudes did not predict enduring depressed mood
              after a negative outcome (Time 3). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with
              dysfunctional attitudes are likely to show increases in depressed
              mood following the occurrence of negative events. The
              relationship between dysfunctional attitudes and increases in

              of the original version is a single-factor structure (9-item

              after omitting 40\% of the original question. A total of 69.1\%
              participants showed orthorectic tendencies. Orthorectic
              tendencies are associated with special eating behavior features
              (dieting frequency, vegetarian and vegan diet). Education level
              did not influence ON tendency and nutritional students did not

              disciplines. This study is the first attempt to translate and to
              evaluate the psychometric properties of a German version of the
              ORTO-15 questionnaire. The ORTO-9-GE questionnaire, however, is
              only a mediocre tool for assessing orthorectic tendencies in

               and the building of these hopes into change. This article shows

               solution-focused therapists to perform their role. Microanalysis
               of actual therapeutic dialogue, by two collaborating
               practitioners, reveals how opportunities are identified, how
               options for solution-focused responding are generated, how the
               preferred opportunities and responses are selected, and how
               rationales for the particular selection may be usefully shared

              the challenges to the fundamental premises of Freud's
              psychoanalysis by those who have shifted to relationship or
              so-called two-person psychologies in our field. The author begins
              by briefly describing a parallel to the recent history of
              psychoanalysis in the sudden rise and fall of scholastic
              philosophy in the 14th century. He then focuses on contemporary
              attacks on Freud's psychoanalysis as a science, based on the
              contention by two-person psychologists that free association by
              the patient and evenly hovering attention by the analyst are
              actually impossible. He reviews Freud's idea of psychoanalysis,
              discusses psychodynamic psychotherapy, both conceived as
              scientific treatment procedures, and describes the current
              assault on their metapsychological and epistemological
              foundations. Returning to the parallel between what happened to
              medieval scholasticism and what has happened to psychoanalysis,
              he examines why this happened, and the resulting fragmentation of
              psychoanalytic practice. The article concludes with suggestions
              for the integration of various schools of psychoanalysis,
              reminding us of Benjamin Franklin's warning: ``We must, indeed,
              all hang together or, most assuredly, we shall all hang

              capsule formulation of Adderall designed to produce a therapeutic
              effect that lasts throughout the day with 1 morning dose. The
              primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and
              safety of SLI381 compared with placebo in the treatment of
              attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children in a
              naturalistic school and home setting. A secondary objective was
              to assess the diurnal variation in responses based on morning and
              afternoon assessments. METHODS: A multicenter, randomized,
              double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial was
              conducted at 47 sites. After a 1-week washout of any previous
              stimulant medication, patients were randomized to receive
              single-daily morning doses of placebo or SLI381 10 mg, 20 mg, or
              30 mg for 3 weeks. Participants aged 6 to 12 years inclusive who
              satisfied Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
              Fourth Edition criteria diagnosis of ADHD were included. The
              primary efficacy parameter was the Conners Global Index Scale for
              Teachers. Secondary efficacy parameters included the Conners
              Global Index Scale for Parents, the Clinical Global Impressions
              Scale for improvement, and the Parent Global Assessment for
              improvement. Safety was assessed by recording adverse events,
              laboratory tests, and vital signs at each visit during the study.
              Physical examinations and electrocardiograms were performed at
              the screening and the end of the study. RESULTS: Five hundred
              eighty-four children were randomized, 563 were included in the
              intent-to-treat population, and 509 completed the entire study.
              Intention-to-treat analysis of Conners Global Index Scale for
              Teachers and Conners Global Index Scale for Parents scores
              revealed significant improvement in morning, afternoon, and late
              afternoon behavior for all active treatment groups versus
              placebo. All active treatment groups showed significant
              dose-related improvement in behavior from baseline. Both the
              Clinical Global Impressions Scale for improvement and Parent
              Global Assessment for improvement showed all doses of SLI381 to
              be superior to placebo at treatment end and both confirmed the
              dose-response relationship between improvement and the SLI381
              dose. The incidence of spontaneously reported adverse events was
              low and similar for active treatments and placebo. CONCLUSIONS:
              SLI381 produced consistent, dose-related improvements on all
              measures of efficacy. The extended-release nature of the SLI381
              formulation was shown by continued, significant improvement in
              afternoon assessments by teachers and afternoon and late
              afternoon assessments by parents. The time course and therapeutic
              effects of SLI381 suggests that this medication is an efficacious
              once-daily treatment for children with ADHD.",

              health care providers use or are interested in using
              complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). People around the
              world rely on CAM, so similar issues face clinicians in many

              that have apply the same general legal principles used in cases
              that involved conventional care while taking into account
              considerations unique to CAM. In ethics, as with conventional
              care, the issues surrounding pediatric CAM use usually involve
              questions about who the appropriate decision-makers are, on what
              ethical principles should clinical decision-making rely, and what
              obligations arise on the part of physicians and other health care
              providers. Clinical decision-making is made more complex by the
              relatively limited research on the efficacy and safety of CAM
              compared with conventional medicine, especially in children,
              which requires clinicians to make decisions under conditions of

               scientific methods as we know them today were not in use at the
               time. Modern scientific methods in neuroscience began to emerge
               much later, leading investigators to examine the role of diet in
               health, including mental wellbeing, with greater precision. This
               review shows how short- and long-term forced dietary
               interventions bring about changes in brain structure, chemistry,
               and physiology, leading to altered animal behavior. Examples
               will be presented to show how diets alter brain chemistry,
               behavior, and the action of neuroactive drugs. Most humans and
               most animal species examined in a controlled setting exhibit a
               fairly reproducible pattern of what and how they eat. Recent
               data suggest that these patterns may be under the neurochemical
               and hormonal control of the organisms themselves. Other data

              nutrition that is characterized by a restrictive diet, ritualized
              patterns of eating, and rigid avoidance of foods believed to be
              unhealthy or impure. Although prompted by a desire to achieve
              optimum health, orthorexia may lead to nutritional deficiencies,
              medical complications, and poor quality of life. Despite its
              being a distinct behavioral pattern that is frequently observed
              by clinicians, orthorexia has received very little empirical
              attention and is not yet formally recognized as a psychiatric
              disorder. In this review, we synthesize existing research to
              identify what is known about the symptoms, prevalence,
              neuropsychological profile, and treatment of orthorexia. An
              examination of diagnostic boundaries reveals important points of
              symptom overlap between orthorexia and anorexia nervosa,
              obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), obsessive-compulsive
              personality disorder (OCPD), somatic symptom disorder, illness
              anxiety disorder, and psychotic spectrum disorders.
              Neuropsychological data suggest that orthorexic symptoms are
              independently associated with key facets of executive dysfunction
              for which some of these conditions already overlap. Discussion of
              cognitive weaknesses in set-shifting, external attention, and
              working memory highlights the value of continued research to
              identify intermediate, transdiagnostic endophenotypes for insight
              into the neuropathogenesis of orthorexia. An evaluation of
              current orthorexia measures indicates a need for further
              psychometric development to ensure that subsequent research has
              access to reliable and valid assessment tools. Optimized
              assessment will not only permit a clearer understanding of
              prevalence rates, psychosocial risk factors, and comorbid
              psychopathology but will also be needed to index intervention
              effectiveness. Though the field lacks data on therapeutic
              outcomes, current best practices suggest that orthorexia can
              successfully be treated with a combination of

               definitive proof of efficacy) for the use of antiretroviral
               agents as postexposure prophylaxis for occupational exposures to
               HIV in the healthcare workplace. Despite the lack of definitive
               evidence of the efficacy of these agents in this setting, over
               the past decade this intervention has become the standard of
               care for healthcare workers who sustain occupational exposures
               to HIV. Administration of these agents--even for a relatively
               short 28-day postexposure course--is often fraught with
               difficulty. All of the agents currently used for postexposure
               prophylaxis regimens have substantial adverse effects, and
               significant adverse effects occur in more than two-thirds of
               individuals electing prophylaxis. This manuscript reiterates
               current US Federal Government guidelines for the administration
               of postexposure prophylaxis, specifically noting that zidovudine
               plus lamivudine (with or without a protease inhibitor) remains
               the recommended regimen. The paper summarises the significant
               toxicities associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase
               inhibitors (primarily nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and bone
               marrow suppression), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
               inhibitors (rash, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms and
               hepatitis, including hepatic decompensation necessitating liver
               transplantation) and protease inhibitors (nausea, vomiting,
               diarrhoea, abdominal pain, hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia,
               headache and anorexia). As a class, the antiretroviral agents
               have an extraordinary number of drug interactions. The
               non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and the protease
               inhibitors are metabolised through the cytochrome P450 pathway,
               and the effects of concomitant administration of protease
               inhibitors with other agents in the same class are discussed, as
               well as the effects of concomitant administration of protease
               inhibitors with non-nucleoside agents. The potential for
               numerous and medically risky drug interactions emphasises the
               importance of planning antiretroviral prophylaxis in
               consultation with practitioners or clinical pharmacists who are
               skilled in the use of these agents and knowledgeable about the
               potential for significant drug interactions that could either
               reduce the benefit of prophylaxis or increase the potential for
               toxicity. Another common problem encountered by individuals
               managing postexposure prophylaxis programmes relates to the
               administration of chemoprophylaxis to a pregnant healthcare
               worker who has sustained an occupational exposure to HIV. We
               address what is known about the potential for toxicity and
               emphasise the recently published warning concerning the deaths
               of pregnant women and their offspring from lactic acidosis while

  abstract = "Over 35 years of research suggests that endogenous hypothalamic
              serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) plays an important part in
              within-meal satiation and post-meal satiety processes. Thus, the
              serotonin system has provided a viable target for weight control,
              critical to the action of at least two effective anti-obesity
              treatments, both producing clinically significant weight loss
              over a year or more. Numerous serotonin receptor subtypes have
              been identified; of these, serotonin 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptors
              have been specifically recognised as mediators of
              serotonin-induced satiety.A number of serotonergic drugs,
              including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),
              dexfenfluramine and 5-HT2C receptor agonists, have been shown to
              significantly attenuate rodent bodyweight gain. This effect is
              strongly associated with marked hypophagia and is probably
              mediated by the hypothalamic melanocortin system. Additionally,
              sibutramine, dexfenfluramine, fluoxetine and the 5-HT2C receptor
              agonist chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) have all been shown to
              modify appetite in both lean and obese humans, resulting in
              reduced caloric intake. Clinical studies demonstrate serotonergic
              drugs specifically reduce appetite prior to and following the
              consumption of fixed caloric loads, and cause a reduction in
              pre-meal appetite and caloric intake at ad libitum meals. Weight
              loss in the obese has also been produced by treatment with both
              the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan and the preferential
              5-HT2C receptor agonist mCPP.A new generation of 5-HT2C receptor
              selective agonists have been developed and at least one,
              lorcaserin (APD356), is currently undergoing clinical trials. In
              addition, 5-HT6 receptor antagonists such as PRX-07034 and
              BVT74316 have been shown to potently reduce food intake and
              bodyweight gain in rodent models and have recently entered
              clinical trials. However, the role of the 5-HT6 receptor in the
              expression of appetite remains to be determined. The hope is that
              these drugs will not only be free of their predecessors' adverse
              effect profiles, but will also be equally or more effective at
              regulating appetite and controlling bodyweight.",

  abstract = "Participants in the sport of bodybuilding are judged by
              appearance rather than performance. In this respect, increased
              muscle size and definition are critical elements of success. The
              purpose of this review is to evaluate the literature and provide
              recommendations regarding macronutrient intake during both
              'off-season' and 'pre-contest' phases. Body builders attempt to
              increase muscle mass during the off-season (no competitive
              events), which may be the great majority of the year. During the
              off-season, it is advantageous for the bodybuilder to be in
              positive energy balance so that extra energy is available for
              muscle anabolism. Additionally, during the off-season, adequate
              protein must be available to provide amino acids for protein
              synthesis. For 6-12 weeks prior to competition, body builders
              attempt to retain muscle mass and reduce body fat to very low
              levels. During the pre-contest phase, the bodybuilder should be
              in negative energy balance so that body fat can be oxidised.
              Furthermore, during the pre-contest phase, protein intake must be
              adequate to maintain muscle mass. There is evidence that a
              relatively high protein intake (approximately 30\% of energy
              intake) will reduce lean mass loss relative to a lower protein
              intake (approximately 15\% of energy intake) during energy
              restriction. The higher protein intake will also provide a
              relatively large thermic effect that may aid in reducing body
              fat. In both the off-season and pre-contest phases, adequate
              dietary carbohydrate should be ingested (55-60\% of total energy
              intake) so that training intensity can be maintained. Excess
              dietary saturated fat can exacerbate coronary artery disease;
              however, low-fat diets result in a reduction in circulating
              testosterone. Thus, we suggest dietary fats comprise 15-20\% of
              the body builders' off-season and pre-contest diets. Consumption
              of protein/amino acids and carbohydrate immediately before and
              after training sessions may augment protein synthesis, muscle
              glycogen resynthesis and reduce protein degradation. The optimal
              rate of carbohydrate ingested immediately after a training
              session should be 1.2 g/kg/hour at 30-minute intervals for 4
              hours and the carbohydrate should be of high glycaemic index. In
              summary, the composition of diets for body builders should be
              55-60\% carbohydrate, 25-30\% protein and 15-20\% of fat, for
              both the off-season and pre-contest phases. During the off-season
              the diet should be slightly hyperenergetic (approximately 15\%
              increase in energy intake) and during the pre-contest phase the
              diet should be hypoenergetic (approximately 15\% decrease in
              energy intake).",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Adolescence and young adulthood are key periods for
               developing norms related to health behaviors and body image, and
               social media can influence these norms. Social media is
               saturated with content related to dieting, fitness, and health.
               Health and fitness-related social media content has received
               significant media attention for often containing objectifying
               and inaccurate health messages. Limited research has identified
               problematic features of such content, including stigmatizing
               language around weight, portraying guilt-related messages
               regarding food, and praising thinness. However, no research has
               identified who is ``liking'' or ``following'' (ie, consuming)
               such content. OBJECTIVE: This exploratory study aimed to
               identify demographics, mental health, and substance use-related
               behaviors that predicted consuming 3 types of health and
               fitness-related social media content-weight loss/fitness
               motivation pages (ie, ``fitspiration''), detox/cleanse pages,
               and diet/fitness plan pages-among young social media users.
               METHODS: Participants (N=1001; age: median 21.06, IQR
               17.64-24.64; female: 723/1001, 72.23\%) completed a
               cross-sectional 112-question online survey aimed at social media
               users aged between 15-29 years residing in Victoria, Australia.
               Logistic regression was used to determine which characteristics
               predicted consuming the 3 types of health and fitness-related
               social media content. RESULTS: A total of 378 (37.76\%)
               participants reported consuming at least 1 of the 3 types of
               health and fitness-related social media content: 308 (30.77\%)
               fitspiration pages, 145 (14.49\%) detox pages, and 235 (23.48\%)
               diet/fitness plan pages. Of the health and fitness-related
               social media content consumers, 85.7\% (324/378) identified as
               female and 44.8\% (324/723) of all female participants consumed
               at least 1 type of health and fitness-related social media
               content. Predictors of consuming at least one type of health and
               fitness-related social media content in univariable analysis
               included female gender (OR 3.5, 95\% CI 2.5-4.9, P<.001), being
               aged 15-17 years (OR 3.0, 95\% CI 2.2-4.0, P<.001), residing
               outside a major city (OR 2.0, 95\% CI 1.4-2.9, P<.001), having
               no post-high school education (OR 2.2, 95\% CI 1.7-2.9, P<.001),
               being born in Australia (OR 2.0, 95\% CI 1.2-3.2, P=.006),
               having a self-reported eating disorder (OR 2.4, 95\% CI 1.5-3.9,
               P<.001), being a victim of bullying (OR 1.7, CI 1.3-2.3,
               P<.001), misusing detox/laxative teas or diet pills (OR 4.6,
               95\% CI 2.8-7.6, P<.001), never using illegal drugs (OR 1.6,
               95\% CI 1.2-2.0, P=.001), and not engaging in risky single
               occasion drinking on a weekly basis (OR 2.0, 95\% CI 1.3-3.0,
               P=.003). CONCLUSIONS: Consumers of health and fitness-related
               social media content were predominantly teenaged girls. There is
               a need to ensure that this social media content portrays
               responsible health messages and to research further the role of
               fitspiration pages, detox pages, and diet/fitness plan pages in

              influence on the two IRAP scores. Specifically, the implicit
              belief that one is thin was lower in participants who exhibited a
              high degree of body dissatisfaction than in participants who
              exhibited a low degree of body dissatisfaction. In contrast, the
              implicit desire to be thin (i.e., thin ideal body image) was
              stronger in participants who exhibited a high level of body
              dissatisfaction than in participants who were less dissatisfied
              with their body. Adding further weight to the idea that both IRAP
              measures captured different underlying constructs, we also
              observed that they correlated differently with body mass index,
              explicit body dissatisfaction, and explicit measures of actual
              and ideal body image. More generally, these findings underscore
              the advantage of using implicit measures that incorporate
              relational information relative to implicit measures that allow
              for an assessment of associative relations only.",

  abstract = "Bratman first proposed orthorexia nervosa in the late 1990s,
              defining it an obsession with eating healthy food to achieve, for
              instance, improved health. Today, in the Swedish media, excessive
              exercising plays a central role in relation to orthorexia. A few
              review articles on orthorexia have been conducted; however, these
              have not focused on aspects of food and eating, sport, exercise,
              or a societal perspective. The overall aim of this study was to
              provide an overview and synthesis of what philosophies of science
              approaches form the current academic framework of orthorexia. Key
              questions were: What aspects of food and eating are related to
              orthorexia? What role do exercise and sports play in relation to
              orthorexia? In what ways are orthorexia contextualized?
              Consequently, the concept of healthism was used to discuss and
              contextualize orthorexia. The method used was an integrative
              literature review; the material covered 19 empirical and
              theoretical articles published in peer-reviewed journals. This
              review demonstrates a multifaceted nature of orthorexia research;
              this field has been examined from four different philosophies of
              science approaches (i.e., empirical-atomistic,
              empirical-atomistic with elements of empirical-holistic,
              empirical-holistic, and rational-holistic) on individual, social,
              and societal levels. The majority of the articles followed an
              empirical-atomistic approach that focused on orthorexia as an
              individual issue, which was discussed using healthism. Our
              analysis indicates a need for (a) more empirical-holistic
              research that applies interpretive qualitative methods and uses a
              social perspective of health, e.g., healthism and (b) examining
              the role of sports and exercise in relation to orthorexia that
              takes the problematizing of ``orthorexic behaviours'' within the
              sports context into account.",

  abstract = "CONTEXT: Research has suggested that the prevalence of young
              women with eating disorders (EDs) is increasing, but determining
              the exact prevalence of EDs within the female student-athlete
              (FS-A) population is difficult. Looking at certain traits may
              help us to identify their level of susceptibility to developing
              an ED. OBJECTIVE: To determine the susceptibility of FS-As to EDs
              in relation to self-concept, including self-esteem and body
              image. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Athletic training
              and health centers at National Collegiate Athletic Association
              Division I, II, and III institutions via e-mail questionnaire
              correspondence. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 439
              FS-As from 17 participating institutions completed the
              questionnaires. The sample was primarily white (83.1\%) and
              underclass (61.8\%). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The questionnaire
              consisted of 4 parts: 3 subscales of the Eating Disorder
              Inventory-2, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Body Cathexis
              Scale, and demographic items. RESULTS: A total of 6.8\% of FS-As
              were susceptible to anorexia and 1.8\% were susceptible to
              bulimia. The majority of FS-As (61\%) reported normal self-esteem
              levels, whereas 29.4\% had high self-esteem. Overall, 64.5\% were
              satisfied and 23\% were very satisfied with their body image.
              CONCLUSIONS: These results are generally positive in that they
              suggest FS-As have high levels of self-concept and are at low
              risk to develop EDs. However, these findings do not mean that all
              concerns should be dismissed. Although more than 90\% of the
              respondents were not susceptible to an ED, there are still FS-As
              who may be. Athletic departments should evaluate their FS-As'
              levels of self-concept so that their susceptibility to EDs can be
              addressed. The emotional aspect of health care should be included
              in providing holistic care for student-athletes. Athletic
              trainers often are the primary health care providers for FS-As,
              so they should be made aware of this concern.",

               others and by themselves. Second, gay and lesbian families, are
               viewed intergenerationally, with each family member is
               influenced by the specific history and culture of his or her own
               family or origin in its sociocultural; context. Third, in family
               therapy, life-cycle ``stage'' theories have been central in the
               study of individual gay and lesbian identity and development.
               Some attention has more recently turned to the the life cycle of
               the gay couple and of the lesbian family. Then, some of the
               dimensions and metaphors that have been of interest to family
               theorists are considered. Questions are addressed throughout the
               chapter: What can we say at present about family structure and
               process and about how these families are doing? How relevant are
               concepts such as boundary, enmeshment, fusion, and cohesion?
               What can these families teach us about heterosexual families,
               about gender identity and relationships? Do such families have
               unique strengths and face unique kinds of problems? The chapter

              there has been a significant increase in the proportion who

              Furthermore, three out of ten stated that they had tried diets to
              achieve weight reduction over the past twelve months. One
              consequence of this trend is a consumption field that requires a

              food and dietary products that help you realize the dream of a

              and how to eat. A typical characteristic of the diets that have
              gained wide acceptance over the past few years is that they are
              in conflict with the national guidelines for a healthy diet.
              Another tendency is that traditional products in the Norwegian
              diet such as bread, potatoes and dairy products, in particular,
              have been up for debate. The purpose of this article is to

              Cosmetic Act in 1938 and escalating with the 1962 Kefauver-Harris
              amendments, increasing pressure has been placed on pharmaceutical
              manufacturers to demonstrate that a drug's benefits outweigh its
              risks. Nowhere has the question of risk versus benefit come under
              greater scrutiny than with anorectics. After the approval in the
              1940s and 1950s of a number of amphetamine and amphetamine-like
              compounds for the treatment of obesity, the U.S. Food and Drug
              Administration struggled to define the efficacy and safety of
              these agents. Labeling restrictions on duration of use and
              warnings about abuse and addiction ultimately contributed to the
              reduced use of anorectics. That trend continued until the
              mid-1990s, when the off-label use of fenfluramine plus
              phentermine (fen-phen) and the approval of dexfenfluramine gave
              rise to widespread, long-term use of anorectics to treat obesity.
              The adverse effects that came to be associated with fenfluramine
              and dexfenfluramine, leading to their eventual withdrawal from
              the market, gave pause to regulators, physicians, patients, and
              drug companies alike. Sibutramine, the latest anorectic to enter
              the market, is now the focus of a landmark trial that is

               extreme care for and selection of what is considered to be pure
               'healthy' food. This ritual leads to a very restrictive diet and
               social isolation as a compensation. Orthorexics obsessively
               avoid foods which may contain artificial colours, flavours,
               preservant agents, pesticide residues or genetically modified
               ingredients, unhealthy fats, foods containing too much salt or
               too much sugar and other components. The way of preparation,
               kitchenware and other tools used are also part of the obsessive
               ritual. People with orthorexia often have a history or features
               in common with anorexic patients. They are very careful,
               detailed and tidy persons with an exagerated need for selfcare
               and protection. Women, adolescents and those who practice sports
               suchs as bodybuidling or ahthetics are the gruops at higher
               risk. A short test has been suggested as a screening tool and
               useful for early diagnosis of the disorder. Treatment of
               orthorexia require a multidisciplinary team involving
               physicians, psychoterapists and dietitians. In some cases,
               antiserotoninergic drugs may be required as part of the

               eating habits that compromise physical and mental health. These
               conditions are seen in small percentages of the population in
               both men and women, but many of these disorders such as anorexia
               nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and orthorexia nervosa are seen within
               the athlete population. The majority of athletes are considered
               to be very healthy in terms of BMI, however in many sports,
               coaches and peers can place a strong emphasis on the importance
               of attaining unrealistic weights in order to excel. This can
               significantly impact the athlete's relationship with food and
               lead to a distorted body image. This review looked at how
               different categories of restricted eating and eating disorders
               cause long-term deterioration of sport performance due to
               subsequent muscle deterioration. Athletes and coaches should be
               educated on the proper nutrition requirements for strenuous
               athletic performance and how to deal with the stress of the lean
               culture of certain sports. Motivating athletes to improve other
               aspects of the sport such as fitness, strength, and endurance
               are healthier ways to improve performance without emphasising
               weight loss that can lead to disordered eating.",

               and distress. Along with the negative impact on the individual,
               previous reports have indicated that compulsive hoarding is not
               only impairing and substantially burdensome for family members,
               but also linked to disruptions in family functioning. The
               present study utilized a path model analysis to examine the
               associations between an array of hoarding variables hypothesized
               to impact family functioning and parent-adult child
               relationships in 199 adult children of hoarders. Results
               revealed that family functioning mediated the relationship
               between hoarding severity and parent-adult child relationship.
               Decreased insight into hoarding symptoms was directly associated
               with decreased quality of parent-adult child relationships,
               which was mediated by family functioning. Increased family
               accommodation was significantly associated with increased
               impairment (work, social, family domains) in adult children of
               hoarders. Clinical implications and future directions in

               1980s. By focusing on solutions instead of problems, it asks

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of mental health problems in Canada is
              highest among youth and young adults. Relatively little is known
              about where they seek support and the factors related to
              help-seeking. DATA AND METHODS: Based on the 2012 Canadian
              Community Health Survey-Mental Health, this study describes
              professional and informal mental health support reported by
              Canadians aged 15 to 24. RESULTS: In 2012, 12\% of 15- to
              24-year-olds reported that, in the previous 12 months, they had
              consulted health professionals about emotional, mental or
              substance use problems; 27\% reported consulting informal sources
              such as family and friends. Young Canadians with mood, anxiety or
              substance disorders, one or more chronic physical conditions,
              higher levels of distress, or who had a traumatic childhood
              experience were more likely than their contemporaries who did not
              have these risk factors to report contact with professional and
              informal sources of support. Those with multiple needs-related
              factors had significantly higher odds of reporting contact with
              professional and informal sources. INTERPRETATION: More than one
              in ten young Canadians consulted professionals and about a
              quarter sought informal support for mental health problems in the
              past year. The percentages were higher among those with multiple

              race, ethnicity, gender, sexual identity, spiritual identity,

              participating supervisees were receiving supervision from one of

              Data were collected through individual, semi-structured
              interviews and a demographic information sheet. Data were

              discussion, supervisor's role in addressing cultural issues,
              degree of intentionality, and scope of attention to culture.
              Participants also described positive and negative experiences
              with attention to cultural issues in supervision and the impact

              the impact of negative experiences include supervisee withdrawal,

              women, aged 54 - 65 years, with increased appetite. They were
              randomly assigned in 2 groups. In group I (n = 30) fluoxetine (20
              mg in the morning) and placebo (in the evening) were administered
              for 24 weeks. Group II (n = 34) received fluoxetine (20 mg in the
              morning) and melatonin (5 mg in the evening) in the same period
              of time. Hamilton anxiety rating scale (HARS), Beck depression
              scale (BDI), the insomnia severity index (ISI) and body mass
              index (BMI) were used to assess the health status and the

              significant reduction in the level of anxiety and depression was
              obtained in both groups. In group I, the ISI decreased from 14.9

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Orthorexia is a pathological fixation about the
              consumption of healthy food. The present study aimed to reveal
              the psychometric properties of the Turkish version of ORTO-15,

              the relationship betweenorthorexia, and eating attitude,
              obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and some demographic variables.
              METHOD: The study included 994 participants aged between 19 and
              66 years. ORTO-15, the Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory,
              and the Eating Attitude Test-40 were administered to the
              participants. RESULTS: A 3-factor solution with varimax rotation
              explained 40.62\% of the variance. When 4 items with factor
              loadings below+/- 0.50 were eliminated from ORTO-15, the
              Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.62. The remaining 11 items
              were thought to have statistically satisfactory properties for
              the Turkish version of ORTO and were collectively referred to as
              ORTO-11. This version was used to investigate the relationship
              between orthorexia, and eating attitude and obsessive-compulsive
              symptoms. Pathological eating attitude and obsessive-compulsive
              symptoms were related to orthorexia. Women exhibited more
              orthorexic symptoms then men. In the present study high a body
              mass index was an important variable for orthorexia, but only
              together with gender (female), pathological eating attitude, and
              increased obsessive-compulsive symptoms. The results,
              implications, and limitations of the study are discussed.
              CONCLUSION: ORTO-11 demonstrated statistically satisfactory
              properties. Orthorexia was related to pathological eating
              attitude and obsessive-compulsive symptoms; however, caution
              should be used when generalizing the reported results.",

  author    = "Scrinis, Gyorgy",
  abstract  = "Popularized by Michael Pollan in his best-selling In Defense of
               Food, Gyorgy Scrinis's concept of nutritionism refers to the
               reductive understanding of nutrients as the key indicators of
               healthy food -- an approach that has dominated nutrition
               science, dietary advice, and food marketing. Scrinis argues this
               ideology has narrowed and in some cases distorted our
               appreciation of food quality, such that even highly processed
               foods may be perceived as healthful depending on their content
               of ``good'' or ``bad'' nutrients. Investigating the butter
               versus margarine debate, the battle between low-fat, low-carb,
               and other weight-loss diets, and the food industry's strategic
               promotion of nutritionally enhanced foods, Scrinis reveals the
               scientific, social, and economic factors driving our modern
               fascination with nutrition.Scrinis develops an original
               framework and terminology for analyzing the characteristics and
               consequences of nutritionism since the late nineteenth century.
               He begins with the era of quantification, in which the idea of
               protective nutrients, caloric reductionism, and vitamins'
               curative effects took shape. He follows with the era of good and
               bad nutritionism, which set nutricentric dietary guidelines and
               defined the parameters of unhealthy nutrients; and concludes
               with our current era of functional nutritionism, in which the
               focus has shifted to targeted nutrients, superfoods, and optimal
               diets. Scrinis's research underscores the critical role of
               nutrition science and dietary advice in shaping our relationship
               to food and our bodies and in heightening our nutritional
               anxieties. He ultimately shows how nutritionism has aligned the
               demands and perceived needs of consumers with the commercial
               interests of food manufacturers and corporations. Scrinis also
               offers an alternative paradigm for assessing the healthfulness
               of foods -- the food quality paradigm -- that privileges food
               production and processing quality, cultural-traditional
               knowledge, and sensual-practical experience, and promotes less
               reductive forms of nutrition research and dietary advice.",

  abstract = "Dietitians are expected to deliver sound and scientifically
              objective advice to the general public, yet their personal
              beliefs and behaviors could influence delivery of nutrition care.
              Increased understanding of the personal attitudes and behaviors
              of dietitians concerning eating behavior and body image could
              help improve dietetic practice. Traditional nutrition education
              emphasizes cognitive eating, i.e., monitoring energy intake and
              comparing macronutrient intakes to the current acceptable ranges.
              Intuitive eating, however, promotes the release of cognitive
              eating in favor of greater attention to physiologic cues, or
              ``body wisdom''. We hypothesized that nutrition students in a
              traditional curriculum would report eating less intuitively than
              non-nutrition majors. We surveyed 258 female undergraduate
              students (96 nutrition majors and 162 non-majors) at the
              University of Massachusetts Amherst. Using Mann-Whitney U tests,
              we assessed the differences between nutrition majors and
              non-majors in terms of: intuitive eating, as measured by the
              Intuitive Eating Scale-2 (IES-2); body mass index (BMI, kg/m2);
              magnitude of body dissatisfaction (actual weight -- ideal
              weight); and dieting behavior. We also used non-parametric
              Spearman's rho correlations and Chi-squared statistics to examine
              relationships between variables. A two-way between-groups
              analysis of variance was used to calculate statistical
              differences in intuitive eating scores between diet behavior and
              major. Contrary to our working hypothesis, we found that IES-2
              scores were significantly higher in majors versus non-majors (p=
              0.01) and significantly lower (pnormalor underweight BMI. These
              observations provide novel information indicating that nutrition
              undergraduate students, who have the intention of becoming
              registered dietitians, report that they eat more intuitively and
              have a lower degree of body dissatisfaction than do undergraduate
              students not majoring in nutrition. Additional research is needed
              to address issues related to body dissatisfaction and body
              weight.",

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Orthorexia nervosa (Greek: ortho--correct, right;
              orexis--appetite, desire) is a term introduced in 1997 by the
              American doctor Steven Bratman and is defined as a pathological
              fixation with righteous and healthy eating. Clear classification
              criteria oforthorexia have not been developed yet and there has
              been an on-going discussion whether it belongs to the group of
              eating disorders or the obsessive-compulsive disorders. AIM: The
              aim of this paper is to summarise briefly the current state of
              knowledge regarding orthorexia and to point out the difficulties
              connected with an attempt to classify it in a given disorders
              group as well as with the attempt to establish the classification
              criteria. DISCUSSION: Despite the fact that the problem of
              orthorexia has been signalled in the Polish media, it has neither
              been discussed nor published in the Polish medical literature
              yet. Orthorexia starts when a diet becomes an escape from
              life--everyday activities are dominated by planning, buying and
              preparing ``proper'' meals. Each departure from this regime
              causes anxiety and guilty conscience and leads to even further
              tightening of the dietary habits. According to Bratmann,
              orthorexia is connected with an illusory feeling of safety
              (preventing from diseases), the urge to exercise a full control
              over one's life (elimination of the unpredictable), ``a hidden
              conformism'' (eating philosophy helps in a subconscious way to
              achieve a culturally accepted model of a beautiful body), a
              search for spirituality and identity, and a desire for
              self-deprivation. CONCLUSIONS: The arguments presented in this
              paper substantiate the expediency of implementing the
              epidemiological studies which will show the scale of the problem,
              its prevalence and conditionings. Data obtained in this way
              should facilitate the verification of classification criteria and
              will also help to formulate the diagnostic criteria of
              orthorexia.",

               ``pure'' or ``healthy'' foods. Despite emergent interest, few
               studies have been published about orthorexia to date. This study
               examined the phenomenology, correlates, and associated
               impairment of orthorexia in 404 undergraduate students. A
               battery of self-report questionnaires assessed orthorexia
               symptoms, related functional impairment, disordered eating,
               perfectionism, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, appearance
               anxiety, fear of negative evaluation, anxiety, and depressive
               symptoms. In total, 35.4\% of participants endorsed elevated
               orthorexia symptoms, with primary concerns related to guilt
               associated with dietary transgressions and experiencing control

               effects on mental health in both clinical and nonclinical

               provides recommendations for future studies. The strongest

               alleviate some symptoms associated with mild to moderate
               depression. The evidence also suggests that physical activity
               and exercise might provide a beneficial adjunct for alcoholism

               and cognitive functioning; reduce the symptoms of anxiety; and

              These disorders have not been officially recognized so that they
              are not classified as independent entities. The term orthorexia
              comes from the Greek word orthos (straight, proper) and orexia
              (appetite). It is characterized by the pathological obsession for
              biologically pure food, which leads to important dietary
              restrictions. Orthorexic patients exclude foods from their diets
              that they consider to be impure because they have herbicides,
              pesticides or artificial substances and they worry in excess
              about the techniques and materials used in the food elaboration.
              This obsession leads to loss of social relationships and
              affective dissatisfactions which, in turn, favors obsessive
              concern about food. In orthorexia, that patient initially wants
              to improve his/her health, treat a disease or lose weight.
              Finally, the diet becomes the most important part of their lives.
              We present a clinical case that responds to the characteristics
              of orthorexia. The differential diagnosis with chronic delusional
              disorder, anorexia nervosa and obsessive-compulsive disorder is
              carried out.",

              problems, and feelings as well as to determine whether there are
              any differences between genders and among different age-groups.
              The research instrument was an Eating Habits Questionnaire (EHQ)
              which consisted of 35 items. There were 382 respondents involved
              in the study. The reliability and factor structure of the
              questionnaire were verified by using factor analysis. The results
              of MANOVA showed that there is a significant difference in the
              habits concerning healthy eating between men and women [F
              (3,378)=4.26, p=0.006; Wilks' Lambda=0.97]. When the results for
              the dependent variables (knowledge, problems, and feelings) were
              considered separately, it was determined that there is no
              significant difference between men and women, which confirms the
              results of the t-test. The effect of age on the three dimensions
              of healthy eating habits was examined within three age-groups, by
              using ANOVA. The results showed that knowledge about healthy
              eating increases with age [F (2,379)=6.14, p=0.002] as well as
              positive feelings which occur as a result of healthy eating [F
              (2,379)=3.66, p=0.027]. Unlike ANOVA, MANOVA showed difference
              among the age-groups only when it came to the 'knowledge'

              Fluoxetine injections during ad libitum feeding led to depressed

              initial 10 days of treatment with full recovery of both intake
              and weight by the end of the study. Fluoxetine treatment of mice

  abstract  = "Background: Orthorexia nervosa is the pathological obsession for
               consuming only biologically pure food that may lead to the
               development of specific ritualistic attitudes towards food
               preparation and the restriction of specific food groups that can
               be harmful to one's health (Zamora et al., 2005; Matera, 2012).
               Aim: Due to the rise in popularity with Instagram and online
               eating disorder communities, and the potential negative outcomes
               on psychosocial health, the purpose of this descriptive study
               was to investigate images tagged with \#orthorexia on Instagram
               over 7 days. Methods: A mixed methods approach was utilized for
               this study. A text analysis was conducted using the Netlytic
               program (Gruzd, 2016) to explore for emerging themes of
               discussion specifically using word count frequency, and a
               network analysis using both a name network (i.e., who mentions
               whom) and a chain network (i.e., who replies to whom) was
               performed. Among a subsample of images, author/image information
               was manually obtained, and a coding scheme (adapted from
               Tiggemann and Zaccardo, 2016) was implemented for a subsample of
               images (results pending). Results: Among the 4,533 records
               downloaded, there were 48,780 unique words associated with the
               posts (in the description of the picture or in the comment
               section). Majority of most commonly used words were associated
               with eating disorder recovery (i.e., 425 instances of
               \#edrecovery; 340 instances of \#recovery; 297 instances of
               \#eatingdisorderrecovery). The chain network/direct interactions
               analysis indicated a large online presence with 1,503 nodes
               (i.e., users) and 1,803 ties (i.e., direct replies between
               users). The coding of \#orthorexia images is pending but will
               help us further understand the orthorexia online community.
               Conclusions: As the network analysis and text analysis suggested
               an eating disorder recovery theme, this suggests that Instagram
               may be being used as a supportive and interactive community for
               those who have/had symptoms of orthorexia.",

               nervosa--an obsession with eating healthfully--and offer expert
               advice on how to treat it. As Americans become better informed
               about health, more and more people have turned to diet as a way
               to lose weight and keep themselves in peak condition. Anorexia
               nervosa and bulimia nervosa--disorders in which the sufferer
               focuses on the quantity of food eaten--have been highly
               documented over the past decade. But as Dr. Steven Bratman
               asserts in this breakthrough book, for many people, eating
               ``correctly'' has become an equally harmful obsession, one that
               causes them to adopt progressively more rigid diets that not
               only eliminate crucial nutrients and food groups, but ultimately
               cost them their overall health, personal relationships, and
               emotional well-being. Health Food Junkies is the first book to
               identify this new eating disorder, orthorexia nervosa, and to
               offer detailed, practical advice on how to cope with and
               overcome it. Orthorexia nervosa occurs when the victim becomes
               obsessed, not with the quantity of food eaten, but the quality
               of the food. What starts as a devotion to healthy eating can
               evolve into a pattern of incredibly strict diets; victims become
               so focused on eating a ``pure'' diet (usually raw vegetables and
               grains) that the planning and preparation of food come to play
               the dominant role in their lives. Health Food Junkies provides
               an expert analysis of some of today's most popular diets--from
               The Zone to macrobiotics, raw-foodism to food allergy
               elimination--and shows not only how they can lead to orthorexia,
               but how they are often built on faulty logic rather than sound
               medical advice. Offering expert insight gleaned from his work
               with orthorexia patients, Dr. Bratman outlines the symptoms of
               orthorexia, describes its progression, and shows readers how to
               diagnose the condition. Finally, Dr. Bratman offers practical
               suggestions for intervention and treatment, giving readers the
               tools they need to conquer this painful disorder, rediscover the
               joys of eating, and reclaim their lives. From the Hardcover

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening
              syndrome that is precipitated by the use of serotonergic drugs
              and overactivation of both the peripheral and central
              postsynaptic 5HT-1A and, most notably, 5HT-2A receptors. This
              syndrome consists of a combination of mental status changes,
              neuromuscular hyperactivity, and autonomic hyperactivity.
              Serotonin syndrome can occur via the therapeutic use of
              serotonergic drugs alone, an intentional overdose of serotonergic
              drugs, or classically, as a result of a complex drug interaction
              between two serotonergic drugs that work by different mechanisms.
              A multitude of drug combinations can result in serotonin
              syndrome. METHODS: This review describes the presentation and
              management of serotonin syndrome and discusses the drugs and
              interactions that can precipitate this syndrome with the goal of
              making physicians more alert and aware of this potentially fatal
              yet preventable syndrome. CONCLUSION: Many commonly used
              medications have proven to be the culprits of serotonin syndrome.
              Proper education and awareness about serotonin syndrome will
              improve the accuracy of diagnosis and promote the institution of
              the appropriate treatment that may prevent significant morbidity

              (FVII) activity and antigen levels we studied a polymorphism

              (IVS7), and the 353Arg-Gln polymorphism. All the polymorphisms,
              which showed strong allelic association, analyzed separately or
              in combination by the one-way analysis of variance, were
              associated with significantly different FVII levels. The 5'F7 and
              353Arg-Gln polymorphic systems, which have very similar allele
              frequencies, contributed to a similar extent to the total
              phenotypic variance, whereas the contribution of the IVS7
              polymorphism was lower. Genetic variation at the FVII locus,
              evaluated on combined genotypes, accounted for up to 40\% of the
              phenotype FVII variance. As also shown by the two-way analysis of
              variance, the use of two out of three markers is advisable, and
              since the 5'F7 polymorphism can be screened by a simple
              immunoassay, it should be preferred for population-based studies.
              No substantial differences between FVII activity and FVII antigen
              levels were found, thus suggesting that the variation was due to
              biosynthesis- or stability-mediated mechanisms. The genetic
              control of FVII levels described in this study plays an important
              role in determining plasma FVII level variability, which may
