              topiramate's efficacy in migraine prevention. OBJECTIVE: To
              assess the efficacy and safety of topiramate as a
              migraine-preventive therapy. DESIGN: A 26-week, randomized,
              double-blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Outpatient
              treatment at 49 US clinical centers. Patients Patients were aged
              12 to 65 years, had a 6-month International Headache Society
              migraine history, and experienced 3 to 12 migraines per month,
              but had 15 or fewer headache days per month during the 28-day
              baseline period. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to
              placebo or topiramate, 50, 100, or 200 mg/d, titrated by 25 mg/wk
              to the assigned dose or as tolerated in 8 weeks; maintenance
              therapy continued for 18 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The
              primary efficacy assessment was a reduction in mean monthly
              migraine frequency across the 6-month treatment phase. Secondary
              end points were responder rate, time to onset of action, mean
              change in migraine days per month, and mean change in rescue
              medication days per month. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-seven
              patients were randomized, and 469 composed the intent-to-treat
              population. The mean +/- SD monthly migraine frequency decreased
              significantly for the 100-mg/d group (from 5.4 +/- 2.2 to 3.3 +/-
              2.9; P <.001) and the 200-mg/d group (from 5.6 +/- 2.6 to 3.3 +/-
              2.9; P <.001) vs the placebo group (from 5.6 +/- 2.3 to 4.6 +/-
              3.0); improvements occurred within the first treatment month.
              Significantly more topiramate-treated patients (50 mg/d, 35.9\%
              [P =.04]; 100 mg/d, 54.0\% [P <.001]; and 200 mg/d, 52.3\% [P
              <.001]) exhibited a 50\% or more reduction in monthly migraine
              frequency than placebo-treated patients (22.6\%). Adverse events
              included paresthesia, fatigue, nausea, anorexia, and taste per

  abstract = "CONTEXT: Several practice guidelines recommend that depression be
              evaluated and treated in patients with cardiovascular disease,
              but the potential benefits of this are unclear. OBJECTIVE: To
              evaluate the potential benefits of depression screening in
              patients with cardiovascular disease by assessing (1) the
              accuracy of depression screening instruments; (2) the effect of
              depression treatment on depression and cardiac outcomes; and (3)
              the effect of screening on depression and cardiac outcomes in
              patients in cardiovascular care settings. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE,
              PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, ISI, SCOPUS, and Cochrane databases
              from inception to May 1, 2008; manual journal searches; reference
              list reviews; and citation tracking of included articles. STUDY
              SELECTION: We included articles in any language about patients in
              cardiovascular care settings that (1) compared a screening
              instrument to a valid major depressive disorder criterion
              standard; (2) compared depression treatment with placebo or usual
              care in a randomized controlled trial; or (3) assessed the effect
              of screening on depression identification and treatment rates,
              depression, or cardiac outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION: Methodological
              characteristics and outcomes were extracted by 2 investigators.
              RESULTS: We identified 11 studies about screening accuracy, 6
              depression treatment trials, but no studies that evaluated the
              effects of screening on depression or cardiovascular outcomes. In
              studies that tested depression screening instruments using a
              priori-defined cutoff scores, sensitivity ranged from 39\% to
              100\% (median, 84\%) and specificity ranged from 58\% to 94\%
              (median, 79\%). Depression treatment with medication or cognitive
              behavioral therapy resulted in modest reductions in depressive
              symptoms (effect size, 0.20-0.38; r(2), 1\%-4\%). There was no
              evidence that depression treatment improved cardiac outcomes.
              Among patients with depression and history of myocardial
              infarction in the ENRICHD trial, there was no difference in
              event-free survival between participants treated with cognitive
              behavioral therapy supplemented by an antidepressant vs usual
              care (75.5\% vs 74.7\%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Depression
              treatment with medication or cognitive behavioral therapy in
              patients with cardiovascular disease is associated with modest
              improvement in depressive symptoms but no improvement in cardiac
              outcomes. No clinical trials have assessed whether screening for
              depression improves depressive symptoms or cardiac outcomes in
              patients with cardiovascular disease.",

  abstract = "There is a growing body of theoretical and clinical literature
              highlighting the role of pride in maintaining eating disordered
              behaviours. Despite its clinical importance, there are no

              psychopathology. This study describes the development and
              validation of the Pride in Eating Pathology Scale (PEP-S), a
              self-report questionnaire that examines feelings of pride towards
              eating disordered symptoms (e.g., pride in food restriction,
              thinness and weight loss). Participants were 390 females,
              recruited from university and community populations, whose mean
              age was 26.99 years. Respondents rated pride in eating pathology
              on a 7-point Likert-scale. Principal Component Analysis indicated
              that the 60-item scale comprised a four component structure: (1)
              pride in weight loss, food control and thinness, (2) pride in
              healthy weight and healthy eating, (3) pride in outperforming

              reliable, quick and easy to administer self-report questionnaire
              that measures pride related to eating pathology. The PEP-S
              assesses four clinically relevant dimensions: (1) pride in weight
              loss, food control and thinness, (2) pride in healthy weight and
              healthy eating, (3) pride in outperforming others and social
              recognition and (4) pride in capturing other people's attention
              due to extreme thinness. The PEP-S has very good internal and
              test-retest reliability, and very good convergent and
              discriminant validity. The PEP-S distinguishes between women with
              higher and lower levels of eating psychopathology. The PEP-S
              makes an important contribution to understanding pride in eating
              psychopathology, which is essential from both clinical and
              theoretical perspectives.",

              well as the dialectical behaviour therapy and emotion-focused
              therapy literature specifies particular beliefs thought to be
              related to emotion dysregulation and therefore to a label of
              borderline personality disorder. The current study aimed to
              develop a questionnaire to measure the beliefs about emotions as
              specified by this literature and to test the relationship of this
              new measure to various aspects of emotion regulation in a
              non-clinical sample of 289 participants. A factor analysis
              extracted six factors, which described beliefs about emotions as
              (a) overwhelming and uncontrollable; (b) shameful and irrational;
              (c) invalid and meaningless; (d) useless; (e) damaging; and (f)

              aspects of emotion dysregulation including distress, borderline
              personality disorder symptoms and behaviours associated with
              dysregulation of emotion, suggesting that beliefs about emotions
              could be an important metacognitive construct involved in the

              eating disorders met criteria outlined in the 4th edition of the
              Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).
              METHOD: Six hundred sixty-eight patients recruited for the
              Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS)
              were reliably assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for
              DSM-IV Axis I Disorders and the Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV
              Personality Disorders. The distribution of ED diagnoses was
              compared among four PD study groups (schizotypal, borderline,

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: A pattern of disordered eating involving a
               pathological fixation with healthy food consumption, labeled
               orthorexia nervosa (ON), has recently generated attention;
               however, research has not yet investigated perceptions of
               ON-related behaviors. This study examined potential
               stigmatization of ON, compared with DSM-5 ED diagnoses. METHOD:
               Participants (N = 505) were randomly assigned to read a vignette
               depicting a woman with anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa
               (BN), binge-eating disorder (BED), or ON. They then answered
               questions about the individual depicted in the vignette. A
               series of MANOVAs investigated whether opinions and beliefs
               about the person depicted varied as a function of the disorder
               described in the vignette. RESULTS: Individuals with ON were
               perceived as less likely to ``improve with treatment'' than
               individuals with BN, and less likely to ``pull themselves
               together,'' than individuals with BED. Individuals with ON and
               AN were viewed as ``hard[er] to talk to'' and more of a ``danger
               to others'' compared with individuals with BED. ON was viewed as
               less distressing, less likely to evoke sympathy, and more
               acceptable than the other disorders. Finally, ``poor living
               choices'' were perceived as contributing more substantially to
               ON. Participants' attributions of various personality
               characteristics did not differ based on ED diagnosis.
               DISCUSSION: Results suggest that ON is viewed as less severe,
               more desirable, and more often the result of personal life
               choices. However, findings also imply that ON is associated with
               stigma, similar to DSM-5 EDs. These negative attitudes might
               reinforce ON behaviors, and limit awareness of their potential
               complications.",

               inhibitor in vitro and in vivo. The conformation of fluoxetine,
               which resembles that of sertraline and other serotonin uptake
               inhibitors, appears to be a key feature that enables its high
               affinity and selective interaction with the serotonin
               transporter. The para-trifluoromethyl substituent, however, is
               also a pivotal structural element. The molecular pharmacology of
               fluoxetine has been well-defined, and its in vivo
               pharmacological effects appear to be mediated almost exclusively
               by serotonin uptake inhibition. Its selectivity for the
               serotonin transporter, lack of affinity for neurotransmitter
               receptors, and retention of selectivity following metabolism to
               norfluoxetine make fluoxetine a useful tool to explore
               pharmacologically induced increases in serotonin
               neurotransmission. Fluoxetine has found a variety of therapeutic
               application. Its use in treating depression has been most
               extensively studied, but controlled clinical studies also
               suggest the drug may have a role in treating obesity and

              day. The interaction between fluoxetine and carbohydrate
              consumption was examined by providing subjects diets that
              engendered varied levels of carbohydrate intake. When subjects
              received placebo and had access to a regular diet, they consumed
              3400 kcal day-1 (53\% carbohydrate, 34\% fat, 13\% protein); and
              fluoxetine decreased caloric intake to 2770 Kcal, without
              affecting macronutrient contribution. Caloric intake (2730 Kcal;
              67\% carbohydrate) under the high-carbohydrate condition when
              subjects received fluoxetine was not different from intake under
              the regular-diet fluoxetine conditions. Subjects reported that
              the high-fat (low-carbohydrate) diet was less palatable and
              consumed 2975 Kcal under placebo conditions (35\% carbohydrate);
              fluoxetine decreased caloric intake by an additional 400 Kcal
              without affecting macronutrient contribution. There was no
              evidence that carbohydrate intake modulated the effects of
              fluoxetine. Fluoxetine decreased food intake by decreasing the
              number of eating occasions. Performance and subjective measures
              were not significantly altered by fluoxetine compared to placebo.
              Thus, there was no evidence of a specific effect of fluoxetine on
              macronutrient consumption, nor were the effects of fluoxetine
              altered by the macronutrient composition of the available diet.",

               stress (ELS) in humans on later behavior and neurobiology is a
               fast developing field. While epidemiological and neurobiological
               studies paint a somber picture of negative outcomes, relatively
               little attention has been devoted to integrating the breadth of
               findings concerning possible cognitive and emotional deficits
               associated with ELS. Emerging findings from longitudinal studies
               examining developmental trajectories of the brain in healthy
               samples may provide a new framework to understand mechanisms
               underlying ELS sequelae. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this review was
               twofold. The first was to summarize findings from longitudinal
               data on normative brain development. The second was to utilize
               this framework of normative brain development to interpret
               changes in developmental trajectories associated with deficits
               in cognitive and affective function following ELS. RESULTS: Five
               principles of normative brain development were identified and
               used to discuss behavioral and neural sequelae of ELS. Early
               adversity was found to be associated with deficits in a range of
               cognitive (cognitive performance, memory, and executive
               functioning) and affective (reward processing, processing of
               social and affective stimuli, and emotion regulation) functions.
               CONCLUSION: Three general conclusions emerge: (1) higher-order,
               complex cognitive and affective functions associated with brain
               regions undergoing protracted postnatal development are
               particularly vulnerable to the deleterious effects of ELS; (2)
               the amygdala is particularly sensitive to early ELS; and (3)
               several deficits, particularly those in the affective domain,
               appear to persist years after ELS has ceased and may increase
               risk for later psychopathology.",

               question the role of professional bodies in addressing rural

              for perfectionism (self-oriented, others-oriented and socially
              prescribed), appearance orientation, overweight preoccupation,

              scores for body areas satisfaction and a secure attachment style.
              There was no significant correlation between orthorexia nervosa

              that overweight preoccupation, appearance orientation and the

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: Social media use is ever increasing amongst young
               adults and has previously been shown to have negative effects on
               body image, depression, social comparison, and disordered
               eating. One eating disorder of interest in this context is
               orthorexia nervosa, an obsession with eating healthily. High
               orthorexia nervosa prevalence has been found in populations who
               take an active interest in their health and body and is
               frequently comorbid with anorexia nervosa. Here, we investigate
               links between social media use, in particularly Instagram and
               orthorexia nervosa symptoms. METHODS: We conducted an online
               survey of social media users (N = 680) following health food
               accounts. We assessed their social media use, eating behaviours,
               and orthorexia nervosa symptoms using the ORTO-15 inventory.
               RESULTS: Higher Instagram use was associated with a greater
               tendency towards orthorexia nervosa, with no other social media
               channel having this effect. In exploratory analyses Twitter
               showed a small positive association with orthorexia symptoms.
               BMI and age had no association with orthorexia nervosa. The
               prevalence of orthorexia nervosa among the study population was
               49\%, which is significantly higher than the general population
               (<1\%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the healthy eating
               community on Instagram has a high prevalence of orthorexia
               symptoms, with higher Instagram use being linked to increased
               symptoms. These findings highlight the implications social media
               can have on psychological wellbeing, and the influence social
               media 'celebrities' may have over hundreds of thousands of
               individuals. These results may also have clinical implications

              associated with enhanced neuropeptide Y (NPY) activity within the
              hypothalamus may operate in part by interacting antagonistically
              with other neural processes responsive to serotonin
              (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT). To test this possibility further,
              experiments were performed to determine if the magnitude of
              feeding produced by injecting NPY into the paraventricular
              nucleus (PVN) or the perifornical hypothalamus (PFH) was
              diminished by coinjections of 5-HT into these two sites or
              peripheral injections of the 5-HT agonist, d-fenfluramine. Adult
              male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted unilaterally with
              stainless steel cannulae aimed to terminate either in the PVN or
              the PFH. In both studies, NPY (235 pmol) produced significant
              feeding in both sites either 1 or 2 h after injection when
              compared to saline. This enhanced feeding response was
              significantly greater in the PFH 2 h after injection (40\% in the
              central study; 70\% in the peripheral study). Coinjection of 5-HT
              (6.3, 12.5, or 25.0 nmol) into either site had no effect on the
              induction of this NPY-induced feeding response. However,
              peripherally injected d-fenfluramine (0.32, 0.63, or 1.25 mg/kg)
              produced strong dose-dependent attenuation both 1- and 2-h food
              intake elicited by 235 pmol NPY in either site, with the PFH
              being proportionately more sensitive to this effect. Viewed
              together, these results suggest that the feeding-suppressant
              effects of systemic fenfluramine on hypothalamic NPY-induced
              feeding may operate largely via peripheral mechanisms and/or
              central ones that have little to do with its 5-HT agonistic

              tool, and the majority of ON research has been conducted among
              European populations. The present study explored the Bratman

              validated tools for assessing disordered eating, body dysmorphic,
              and obsessive-compulsive tendencies among college students
              attending a western university. A convenience sample of 448
              college students with a mean age of 22 years was recruited to
              complete an online survey that included the BOT, Eating Attitudes
              Test-26 (EAT-26), Body Dysmorphic Disorder Questionnaire (BDDQ),
              Obsessive Compulsive Inventory, Revised (OCI-R) and demographics.
              Spearman correlation, Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, chi-square,
              and multiple linear regressions were used for analyses. The
              average BOT score was 4.71, near the ``health fanatic'' range,

              having significantly higher median BOT scores. Gender, age, and

              Significant positive correlations were observed between total BOT
              and EAT-26 scores (r = .47, p < 0.01), BOT and BDDQ scores (r =

              with other mental disorders including depression, suicidal
              behavior, and substance abuse. In an effort to elucidate the
              neurobiological underpinnings of impulsive aggression and to help
              account for its connections with these other disorders, this
              paper reviews relevant biochemical, brain imaging, and genetic
              studies. The review suggests that dysfunctional interactions
              between serotonin and dopamine systems in the prefrontal cortex
              may be an important mechanism underlying the link between
              impulsive aggression and its comorbid disorders. Specifically,
              serotonin hypofunction may represent a biochemical trait that
              predisposes individuals to impulsive aggression, with dopamine
              hyperfunction contributing in an additive fashion to the

              function in the ventral prefrontal cortex. This underlying

              impulsive aggression is understood in the context of dopamine

              with 10 mg/kg fluoxetine for 12-23 days. In the first experiment,
              body weight and vaginal smears were monitored daily. Fluoxetine
              treatment reduced body weight within the first 24 h of treatment.
              Fluoxetine treatment also elongated the estrous cycle, reduced
              blood levels of progesterone, and eliminated lordosis behavior.
              In the second experiment, body weight and food intake were
              examined and a pair-fed group was included to determine if
              fluoxetine-induced anorexia contributed to the disturbance of the
              estrous cycle. In pair-fed rats, effects similar to fluoxetine
              treatment were present. These results lead to the suggestion that
              fluoxetine's anorectic properties could disrupt the female's
              normal endocrine cyclicity and that this disruption could be
              relevant to the reduction in sexual behavior and motivation.
              However, when the duration of fluoxetine treatment was extended
              beyond 16 to 17 days, fluoxetine-treated female rats reinitiated
              vaginal cyclicity and showed evidence of normal sexual
              receptivity. In contrast, the estrous cycles of their pair-fed
              counterparts remained disrupted. Thus, restricted food intake
              appears to contribute to the disruption of the estrous cycle and
              elimination of sexual receptivity during fluoxetine treatment.
              However, compensatory changes in the serotonergic system that are
              associated with chronic fluoxetine administration may contribute
              to the gradual recovery of estrous cyclicity and sexual

              physical and psychosocial symptoms of hyperemesis gravidarum (HG)
              on individuals. Its purpose is to aid planning and implementation
              of tailored care for women with HG. To our knowledge no similar
              tool exists. OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity and reliability of
              the HIS questionnaire. DESIGN: As no similar tool exists, we
              compared the HIS with three tools that reflect its key areas:
              physical impact (Pregnancy Unique Quantification of Emesis--PUQE
              score and markers of severity of HG), psychological impact
              (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score--HADS) and social impact
              (SF12 quality of life score). SETTING: A large regional referral,
              women and children's hospital in the North West of England.
              PARTICIPANTS: The HIS was evaluated on 50 women admitted to
              hospital with HG and 50 women recruited from ante-natal clinic
              without severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and with an
              uncomplicated pregnancy. RESULTS: Good criterion validity was
              demonstrated by strong significant correlations with all three
              scores (PUQE, r=0.75, p<0.001, HADS, depression r=0.76, p<0.001,
              and SF12, mental component r=-0.65, p<0.001). The HIS showed good
              internal consistency, Cronbach alpha 0.87, split half 0.80.
              CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence for the validity and reliability
              of the HIS to assess the impact of the physical and psychosocial
              symptoms of HG. Further research is currently underway to
              establish the clinical utility of the HIS questionnaire in the
              care of women hospitalised with HG.",

              is the lack of a structured interview, which may affect
              reliability. The HAM-D and the MADRS are often used conjointly as
              endpoints in depression trials. We designed a hybrid
              questionnaire that allows administration of MADRS and 31 HAM-D
              items simultaneously. Seventy mood disorder patients (60 bipolar
              I, 10 major depressive disorder) were administered the
              HAM-D/MADRS Interview (HMI) as part of a larger study. Interrater
              reliability for 50 patients was excellent for the HAM-D and the

  abstract = "The Behavioral Satiety Sequence (BSS) is the name given to the
              orderly transitions of eating, activity grooming and resting
              measured during the postingestive period. Because the BSS is
              considered to reflect the operations of natural physiological
              processes underlying satiety, the sequence can be used to
              discriminate between different drugs (and other manipulations)
              that reduce food intake via these natural physiological
              mechanisms or those that do so by interference. The BSS is only
              produced by the presence of a caloric load in the gut, and the
              preabsorptive satiety factors (such as CCK) the caloric load
              triggers. The BSS is most accurately defined by continuous
              observation rather than time or event sampling techniques
              [Partial Time Sampling (PTS) or Momentary Time Sampling (MTS)].
              Continuous observation also allows the true duration and true
              frequency of each behavior to be analyzed. Continuous observation
              can be used to determine if the profiles associated with the
              reduction in food intake is caused by nausea, sedation,
              hyperactivity, or altered palatability of food. At the present
              time is it possible to identify a number of drugs whose
              suppression of food intake is associated with the disruption or
              preservation of the BSS. Drugs that increase synaptic 5-HT
              activity such d-fenfluramine, fluoxetine. and sibutramine all
              preserve the BSS and advance the onset of resting. The 5-HT1b/2c
              agonists mCPP and TFMPP and the 5-HT1b agonist CP-94,253 produce
              similar effects. However, the 5-HT2 agonist DOI and the 5-HT1a/1b
              agonist RU-24969 disrupt the BSS by inducing hyperactivity as
              does amphetamine. The 5-HT2 agonist MK-212 disrupts the BSS by
              inducing sedation. Selective dopamine agonists, at low doses,
              such as SKF-38393 (DA1) and LY-171555 (DA2) also preserve the
              BSS. However, detailed behavioral analysis of the effects of many

              clinical trials of fluoxetine reinforced this agent's more
              favorable adverse-event profile compared with tricyclic
              antidepressants (TCAs). OBJECTIVES: The present meta-analysis
              sought to provide a reanalysis of updated adverse-event and
              discontinuation data for fluoxetine 20 to 80 mg/d compared with
              TCAs and placebo in the treatment of major depressive disorder
              (MDD) in adults. A subanalysis to assess the safety profile of
              the most commonly used effective dose of fluoxetine in MDD (20
              mg) was also conducted. METHODS: Data were obtained from 25
              double-blind clinical trials involving 4016 patients with MDD
              randomized to treatment with fluoxetine 20 to 80 mg/d, TCAs, or
              placebo. The subanalysis included data from 6 trials involving
              1258 patients treated with fixed 20-mg doses of fluoxetine or
              placebo. Spontaneously reported treatment-emergent adverse
              events, reasons for discontinuation, and events leading to
              discontinuation were compared between groups. RESULTS: The age of
              the 4016 randomized patients ranged from 12 to 90 years, with a
              mean age of 46 years. Most patients were white (92\%), and 62\%
              were female. The age of the 1258 patients in the 20-mg fixed-dose
              population ranged from 18 to 90 years, with a mean age of 54
              years; as in the total population, most of these patients were
              white (92\%), and 57\% were female. The adverse-event profiles of
              fluoxetine and TCAs in these trials were consistent with the
              typical profiles of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and
              TCAs. At a dose of 20 mg/d, fluoxetine-treated patients had a
              discontinuation rate due to adverse events that was not
              statistically significantly different from that in placebo
              recipients. Discontinuation rates due to lack of efficacy were
              not significantly different between fluoxetine and TCAs. However,
              significantly more TCA-treated patients discontinued therapy
              because of adverse events and significantly fewer completed
              treatment compared with fluoxetine-treated patients (both, P or =

              nervousness, rash, somnolence, sweating, and tremor in
              TCA-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this large series of
              clinical trials confirm that fluoxetine is well tolerated in the
              acute treatment of MDD in adults, especially at a dosage of 20
              mg/d, and is better tolerated than the recommended doses of TCAs.",

  abstract = "The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have emerged
              as a major therapeutic advance in psychopharmacology. As a
              result, the discovery of these agents marks a milestone in
              neuropsychopharmacology and rational drug design, and has
              launched a new era in psychotropic drug development. Prior to the
              SSRIs, all psychotropic medications were the result of chance
              observation. In an attempt to develop a SSRI, researchers
              discovered a number of nontricyclic agents with amine-uptake
              inhibitory properties, acting on both noradrenergic and
              serotonergic neurons with considerable differences in potency. A
              given drug may affect one or more sites over its clinically
              relevant dosing range and may produce multiple and different
              clinical effects. The enhanced safety profile includes a reduced
              likelihood of pharmacodynamically mediated adverse drug-drug
              interactions by avoiding affects on sites that are not essential
              to the intended outcome. SSRIs were developed for inhibition of
              the neuronal uptake pump for serotonin (5-HT), a property shared
              with the TCAs, but without affecting the other various
              neuroreceptors or fast sodium channels. The therapeutic mechanism
              of action of SSRIs involves alteration in the 5-HT system. The
              plethora of biological substrates, receptors and pathways for
              5-HT are candidates to mediate not only the therapeutic actions
              of SSRIs, but also their side effects. A hypothesis to explain
              these immediate side effects is that 5-HT is increased at
              specific 5-HT receptor subtypes in discrete regions of the body
              where the relevant physiologic processes are regulated. Marked
              differences exist between the SSRIs with regard to effects on
              specific cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, and thus the likelihood
              of clinically important pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions.
              Although no clear relationship exists between the clinical
              efficacy, plasma concentration of SSRIs, nor any threshold that
              defines toxic concentrations, but therapeutic drug monitoring
              (TDM) may be useful in special populations, such as in elderly
              patients, poor metabolizers (PM) of sparteine (CYP2D6) or
              mephenytoin (CYP2C19), and patients with liver and kidney
              impairment. Several meta-analyses have reviewed the comparative
              efficacy of TCAs and SSRIs, and concluded that both TCAs and
              SSRIs have similar efficacy in the treatment of depression. SSRIs
              have demonstrated better efficacy and tolerability in the
              treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). They have also
              been found to be effective in the treatment for social anxiety
              disorder both in reducing total levels of social anxiety and in
              improving overall clinical condition. The benefit of SSRIs in
              anorexia nervosa (AN) is apparently short-term unless medication
              is given in the context of nutritional or behavioral therapy. No
              single antidepressant can ever be recommended for every patient,
              but in a vast majority of patients, SSRIs should be considered as
              one of the first-line drugs in the treatment of depression.",

  abstract  = "Case conceptualization is a foundation of cognitive-behavioural
               therapy (CBT) because it describes and explains clients'
               presentations in ways that inform interventions. Yet the
               evidence base challenges the claimed benefits of case
               conceptualization. This paper reviews the rationale and evidence
               base for case conceptualization and outlines a new approach that
               uses the metaphor of a case conceptualization crucible in which
               a client's particular history, experience and strengths are
               synthesized with theory and research to produce an original and
               unique account of clients' presenting issues. The crucible
               metaphor illustrates three key defining principles of case
               conceptualization. First, heat drives chemical reactions in a
               crucible. In our model, collaborative empiricism between
               therapist and client provides the heat. Second, like the
               chemical reaction in a crucible, conceptualization develops over
               time. Typically, it begins at more descriptive levels, later a
               conceptualization incorporates explanatory elements and, if
               necessary, it develops further to include a longitudinal
               explanation of how pre-disposing and protective factors
               influence client issues. Finally, new substances formed in a
               crucible are dependent on the chemical characteristics of the
               materials put into it. Rather than simply look at client
               problems, our model incorporates client strengths at every stage
               of the conceptualization process to more effectively alleviate
               client distress and promote resilience.",

              notoriously difficult. Traditional drug development fails to
              exploit knowledge of the psychological factors that crucially
              influence appetite, concentrating instead on restrictive criteria
              of intake and weight reduction, allied to a mechanistic view of
              energy regulation. Drugs are under development that may produce
              beneficial changes in appetite expression in the obese. These
              currently include glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs such as
              liraglutide, an amylin analog davalintide, the 5-HT(2C) receptor
              agonist lorcaserin, the monoamine re-uptake inhibitor
              tesofensine, and a number of combination therapies such as
              pramlintide and metreleptin, bupropion and naltrexone,
              phentermine and topiramate, and bupropion and zonisamide.
              However, the effects of these treatments on eating behavior
              remain poorly characterized. Obesity is typically a consequence
              of overconsumption driven by an individual's natural sensitivity
              to food stimuli and the pleasure derived from eating.
              Intuitively, these processes should be effective targets for
              pharmacotherapy, and behavioral analysis can identify drugs that
              selectively affect desire to eat, enjoyment of eating, satiation
              or postmeal satiety. Rational interventions designed specifically
              to modulate these processes could limit the normally aversive
              consequences of caloric restriction and maximize an individual's

              involvement of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and orexins in the

              orexin immunostaining in several hypothalamic regions. RESEARCH
              METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Male obese Zucker (fa/fa) rats were
              administered fluoxetine (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally) daily for 2
              weeks. The control group was administered 0.9\% NaCl solution.
              Carcass composition was assessed using the official methods of
              the Association of Official Analytical Chemists. To test the
              potential thermogenic effect of fluoxetine administration, total
              body oxygen consumption was measured daily for 60 minutes before
              fluoxetine or saline injection and for 30 minutes after drug or
              saline injection. Hypothalamic arcuate and paraventricular
              nuclei, and the lateral hypothalamic area were immunostained for
              NPY, orexin A, and orexin B. Commercial kits were used for serum
              determinations. RESULTS: Chronic fluoxetine administration in
              obese Zucker rats generated a reduction in body weight gain, food
              intake, adipocyte size, fat mass, and body protein. A decrease in
              NPY immunostaining in the paraventricular nucleus, without
              changes in the arcuate, was observed. However, no changes were
              observed in the number of neural cells immunostained for orexin A
              or orexin B in the lateral hypothalamic area. DISCUSSION: Due to
              the hyperphagic effect of NPY in the paraventricular nucleus,
              these results suggest that NPY, but not orexins, could be
              involved in the anorexigenic effect of fluoxetine in obese Zucker

              memory T cells in humans with the potential to recognize
              SARS-CoV-2. Here, we first studied T cell responses to structural
              (nucleocapsid protein, NP) and non-structural (NSP-7 and NSP13 of
              ORF1) regions of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 convalescents (n=36). In
              all of them we demonstrated the presence of CD4 and CD8 T cells
              recognizing multiple regions of the NP protein. We then showed
              that SARS-recovered patients (n=23) still possess long-lasting
              memory T cells reactive to SARS-NP 17 years after the 2003
              outbreak, which displayed robust cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2
              NP. Surprisingly, we also frequently detected SARS-CoV-2 specific
              T cells in individuals with no history of SARS, COVID-19 or
              contact with SARS/COVID-19 patients (n=37). SARS-CoV-2 T cells in
              uninfected donors exhibited a different pattern of
              immunodominance, frequently targeting the ORF-1-coded proteins
              NSP7 and 13 as well as the NP structural protein. Epitope
              characterization of NSP7-specific T cells showed recognition of
              protein fragments with low homology to ``common cold'' human
              coronaviruses but conserved amongst animal betacoranaviruses.
              Thus, infection with betacoronaviruses induces multispecific and
              long-lasting T cell immunity to the structural protein NP.
              Understanding how pre-existing NP- and ORF-1-specific T cells
              present in the general population impact susceptibility and
              pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is of paramount importance
              for the management of the current COVID-19 pandemic.",

              lessons can be drawn from the study of the full transmission
              dynamics of its causative agent-severe acute respiratory syndrome
              coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)- in Wuhan (China), where vigorous
              non-pharmaceutical interventions have suppressed the local
              outbreak of this disease1. Here we use a modelling approach to
              reconstruct the full-spectrum dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan
              between 1 January and 8 March 2020 across 5 periods defined by
              events and interventions, on the basis of 32,583
              laboratory-confirmed cases1. Accounting for presymptomatic
              infectiousness2, time-varying ascertainment rates, transmission
              rates and population movements3, we identify two key features of
              the outbreak: high covertness and high transmissibility. We
              estimate 87\% (lower bound, 53\%) of the infections before 8
              March 2020 were unascertained (potentially including asymptomatic
              and mildly symptomatic individuals); and a basic reproduction
              number (R0) of 3.54 (95\% credible interval 3.40-3.67) in the
              early outbreak, much higher than that of severe acute respiratory
              syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)4,5.
              We observe that multipronged interventions had considerable
              positive effects on controlling the outbreak, decreasing the
              reproduction number to 0.28 (95\% credible interval 0.23-0.33)
              and-by projection-reducing the total infections in Wuhan by
              96.0\% as of 8 March 2020. We also explore the probability of
              resurgence following the lifting of all interventions after 14
              consecutive days of no ascertained infections; we estimate this
              probability at 0.32 and 0.06 on the basis of models with 87\% and
              53\% unascertained cases, respectively-highlighting the risk
              posed by substantial covert infections under changing control
              measures. These results have important implications when
              considering strategies of continuing surveillance and

               randomized, controlled trial, we assigned 488 children between
               the ages of 7 and 17 years who had a primary diagnosis of
               separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or
               social phobia to receive 14 sessions of cognitive behavioral
               therapy, sertraline (at a dose of up to 200 mg per day), a
               combination of sertraline and cognitive behavioral therapy, or a
               placebo drug for 12 weeks in a 2:2:2:1 ratio. We administered
               categorical and dimensional ratings of anxiety severity and
               impairment at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, and 12. RESULTS: The
               percentages of children who were rated as very much or much
               improved on the Clinician Global Impression-Improvement scale
               were 80.7\% for combination therapy (P<0.001), 59.7\% for
               cognitive behavioral therapy (P<0.001), and 54.9\% for
               sertraline (P<0.001); all therapies were superior to placebo
               (23.7\%). Combination therapy was superior to both monotherapies
               (P<0.001). Results on the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale
               documented a similar magnitude and pattern of response;
               combination therapy had a greater response than cognitive
               behavioral therapy, which was equivalent to sertraline, and all
               therapies were superior to placebo. Adverse events, including
               suicidal and homicidal ideation, were no more frequent in the
               sertraline group than in the placebo group. No child attempted
               suicide. There was less insomnia, fatigue, sedation, and
               restlessness associated with cognitive behavioral therapy than
               with sertraline. CONCLUSIONS: Both cognitive behavioral therapy
               and sertraline reduced the severity of anxiety in children with
               anxiety disorders; a combination of the two therapies had a
               superior response rate. (ClinicalTrials.gov number,

              considered Indigenous people's understandings of mental health
              and provided details on methodology. Five articles from four
              qualitative studies met these criteria. Meta-ethnography was used
              to identify common themes emerging from the original studies.
              Reciprocal translation was used to synthesize the findings to
              provide new interpretations extending beyond those presented in
              the original studies. An overarching theme emerged from the
              synthesis: the dynamic interconnectedness between the
              multi-factorial components of life circumstances. Reciprocal
              translations and synthesis regarding Indigenous understandings of
              mental health and illness resulted in five themes: (i) culture

               (1902?1987) was designed to promote openness, growth and change
               in understanding the counseling processes. It is an approach
               which is practical and helpful in education, because it can
               solve some of the problems outside the curriculum faced by
               students. For example it provides a way of understanding and
               solving issues of relationships, emotional development and
               ethical behaviour that seem to be at the root of most of the
               problems in school and society at large. However, it is
               essential to incorporate some accelerating ingredients to inform
               conditions which facilitate growth. These include acceptance,
               empathy and positive regard from others. For example it has been
               realized that if an individual is denied acceptance and positive
               regard they fail to relate the meaning of their experience to
               themselves and positive growth in such a relevant way is
               inhibited. However, the approach is faced with some drawbacks
               which will be explored. Teaching today in British schools is a
               very challenging job. It is becoming increasingly difficult to
               establish a classroom environment that is free from disruptive
               behaviour. The person-centred approach, where the student as the
               client is made responsible of his or her own behaviour, could be
               part of the solution. This could be the focus of an educational
               yet assertive discipline program. This paper will discuss the
               person-centred approach in counseling touching on the process of
               the helping relationship, empathy, congruence, unconditional
               positive regard as important concepts of the approach and some

              Our paper notes the important contribution of school educators
              whilst warning of the current need to specifically examine how
              teachers and school personnel may be best trained and prepared
              for such a preventive role, whether they currently feel willing
              and able to undertake such a role, and whether some groups of
              teachers may be personally susceptible to body image and eating
              problems. It is vital to understand the knowledge, behaviors,
              attitudes, and expectations of educators implementing prevention
              programs in order to ensure that they are personally and
              professionally capable of carrying out prevention initiatives in

               construct the meanings of sport, health and the body.
               Specifically, the girls refer to healthism, within which sport
               is seen to provide a means to achieve good health and a slim and
               feminine body. These references reflect a set of knowledge and
               discourses important to Western cultures. Alternative discursive
               resources exist, yet were not utilised. We argue that the girls'
               adoption of healthist ideas is used to counter cultural

              activated emotion and purported regulatory processes; analysis of

              and multiple, convergent measures. By offering this perspective,

               used therapeutic approach that focuses on helping clients
               construct solutions rather than solve problems. The approach
               evolved in a clinical context amid many anecdotal reports of
               success from both therapists and clients, but it has not been
               subjected to controlled empirical testing until very recently.
               In this article we critically review all of the controlled
               outcome studies of SFBT to date (N = 15) to assess the extent to
               which SFBT has received empirical support. Five studies were
               well-controlled and all showed positive outcomes?four found SFBT
               to be better than no treatment or standard institutional
               services, and one found SFBT to be comparable to a known
               intervention: Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depression (IPT).
               Findings from the remaining 10 studies, which we consider
               moderately or poorly controlled, were consistent with a
               hypothesis of SFBT effectiveness. We conclude that the 15
               studies provide preliminary support for the efficacy of SFBT but
               do not permit a definitive conclusion. Our critique highlights
               areas where methodology in future studies can be strengthened to
               provide more conclusive evidence of SFBT efficacy.",

              associated with adverse health consequences, including increased
              risk for body dissatisfaction and disordered eating behaviors,
              which are risk factors for eating disorders. Although concerns
              about these problems have stimulated calls for broader
              intervention efforts in schools, actions thus far have been
              limited. This study examined educators' perspectives about
              potential policy actions to address these issues in schools.
              METHODS: Educators (N = 240) completed an online questionnaire
              assessing their support for 11 potential school-based policy
              actions to address weight-related bullying and eating disorders.
              Participants also rated policies according to their feasibility
              and potential for positive impact. RESULTS: Forty-eight percent
              of participants observed weight-related bullying in their school
              and 99\% expressed the importance of intervening in such
              incidents. A large majority (75\%-94\%) supported 8 of the 11
              policies, especially actions requiring school-based health
              curriculum to include content on eating disorder prevention
              (94\%), and addressing weight-bullying through antibullying
              policies (92\%), staff training (89\%), and school curriculum
              (89\%). Strongly supported policies were viewed by participants
              as being the most impactful and feasible to implement.
              CONCLUSIONS: Educators recognize weight-related bullying and
              eating disorders as problems in their schools that warrant
              improved prevention and intervention efforts at the policy level.",

              the regulation of emotions. We argue that mindfulness has
              achieved effective outcomes in the treatment of anxiety,
              depression, and other psychopathologies through the contribution
              of mindfulness to emotional regulation. We consider the unique
              factors that mindfulness meditation brings to the process of
              emotion regulation that may account for its effectiveness. We
              review experimental evidence that points towards the unique

              regulatory effects of cognitive reappraisal mechanisms. A

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Research is needed to clarify and improve our
              understanding of appropriateness and safety issues concerning
              antidepressant (AD) treatment. We explored the long-term trend in
              the dispensing of pediatric ADs using provincial,
              population-based data from Canada. METHODS: Data covering 22 ADs
              were drawn from the Saskatchewan Ministry of Health
              administrative data files in outpatient settings. The data were
              for 9 triennial years from 1983 to 2007, a 24-year period, for
              those aged 0 to 19 in the general population. Descriptive
              analyses were used. RESULTS: In 1983, 5.9 per 1000 population
              aged 0 to 19 were dispensed at least 1 AD; this decreased to 5.1
              per 1000 population in 1989, and then increased to 15.4 per 1000
              population in 2007, with a slower increase after 2004. Both sexes
              were dispensed more ADs from 1989 onwards, with females being the
              heavier users. The rate of AD use increased significantly with
              age, and this trend became more pronounced after 1998. Family
              physicians were the major prescribers and their prescriptions
              significantly increased from 1989 to 2004 and decreased in 2007.
              The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was
              the major reason for the increase. The number of AD scripts per
              patient also increased. CONCLUSIONS: The growth in the prevalence
              of AD use among children and youth was largely caused by the use
              of SSRIs. The possibility of safety issues induced by AD use
              among children and adolescents, and different patterns of
              medication practice, suggest continuing education is warranted.",

              psychotherapeutic interventions require culturally competent
              delivery for ethnoracial minority clients to protect the
              distinctive cultural orientations of these clients. Dominant
              disciplinary conceptualizations of cultural competence are ``kind
              of person'' models that emphasize specialized awareness,
              knowledge, and skills on the part of the practitioner. Even
              within psychology, this approach to cultural competence is
              controversial owing to professional misgivings concerning its
              culturally essentialist assumptions. Unfortunately, alternative
              ``process-oriented'' models of cultural competence emphasize such
              generic aspects of therapeutic interaction that they remain in
              danger of losing sight of culture altogether. Thus, for cultural
              competence to persist as a meaningful construct, an alternative
              approach that avoids both essentialism and generalism must be
              recovered. One means to capture this alternative is to shift
              focus away from culturally competent therapists toward culturally
              commensurate therapies. Indigenous communities in North America
              represent interesting sites for exploring this shift, owing to
              widespread political commitments to Aboriginal cultural
              reclamation in the context of postcoloniality. Two examples from
              indigenous communities illustrate a continuum of cultural
              commensurability that ranges from global psychotherapeutic
              approaches at one end to local healing traditions at the other.
              Location of culturally integrative efforts by indigenous

              local, agentic, and intentional deconstructions and

  abstract = "Emotion regulation has been conceptualized as a process by which
              individuals modify their emotional experiences, expressions, and
              physiology and the situations eliciting such emotions in order to
              produce appropriate responses to the ever-changing demands posed
              by the environment. Thus, context plays a central role in emotion
              regulation. This is particularly relevant to the work on emotion
              regulation in psychopathology, because psychological disorders
              are characterized by rigid responses to the environment. However,
              this recognition of the importance of context has appeared
              primarily in the theoretical realm, with the empirical work
              lagging behind. In this review, the author proposes an approach
              to systematically evaluate the contextual factors shaping emotion
              regulation. Such an approach consists of specifying the
              components that characterize emotion regulation and then
              systematically evaluating deviations within each of these
              components and their underlying dimensions. Initial guidelines
              for how to combine such dimensions and components in order to
              capture substantial and meaningful contextual influences are
              presented. This approach is offered to inspire theoretical and
              empirical work that it is hoped will result in the development of
              a more nuanced and sophisticated understanding of the

              lack sensitivity for some diagnoses and many not be responsive in
              eating disorder patients. This article describes the development
              and validation of a condition-specific QoL measure for
              adolescents and adults with eating disorders--the Eating
              Disorders Quality of Life Scale (EDQLS). METHODS: Multi-source
              and multi-stage methods were used to develop the EDQLS, with
              participation of patients with EDs, their family members and ED
              treatment providers. Sources for domain and item development
              included 39 articles, 12 patient and 10 treatment provider
              interviews, and 31 first person narratives from the internet.
              Four stages of validation and pre-testing involving 17 patients,
              10 family members and 18 providers reduced 233 items to 40 items
              in 12 domains. These items were pilot tested in 41 ED patients.
              RESULTS: The final instrument was then validated in a 12 site
              sample of 171 individuals aged 14-60 with EDs. All items showed
              good dispersion. The total raw mean score was 110 out of 200 (SD
              27.6) with higher scores indicating better QoL. Internal
              consistency was excellent (Cronbach's alpha = .96) and subscale
              internal consistency ranged from alpha .36 to .79 providing
              evidence for a strong overall construct and some
              multi-dimensionality. Validity was supported by significant
              differences in mean EDQLS according to severity levels on the
              EDI-2 (F = 95.3, p <.001) and the BSI (F = 86.9, p <.001). EDQLS
              scores were positively associated with time in treatment (F =
              4.65, p = .01) suggesting responsiveness. A strong positive
              association was also found between EDQLS scores and stage of
              change (F = 15.1 p <.001). Pearson's correlations between the
              EDQLS and criterion instrument scores were .71 for the SF-12

              model (GLM) to account for repeated measurement (p < .001).
              Responsiveness was good overall (Cohen's d = .61 and .80), and
              confirmed using anchor methods across 5 levels of self-reported
              improvement in health status (p < .001). Effect sizes across time
              were moderate or large for for all age groups. Internal
              consistency (Chronbach's alpha=.96) held across measurement
              points and patterns of responsiveness held across subscales.
              EDQLS responsiveness exceeded that of the Quality of Life
              Inventory, the Short Form-12 (mental and physical subscales) and
              was similar to the 16-dimension quality of life scale.

              diverse and clinically heterogeneous programs over a relatively
              short time period in adolescents and adults. It shows promise as

              communication strategies for providing mental health first aid to
              an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adolescent. These

  abstract = "Weight-control behaviour is commonly observed in a wide range of
              elite sports, especially leanness sports, where control over body
              weight is crucial for high peak performance. Nonetheless, there
              is only a fine line between purely functional behaviour and
              clinically relevant eating disorders. Especially the rapid form
              of weight manipulation seems to foster later eating disorders. So
              far, most studies have focussed on adult athletes and
              concentrated on manifest eating disorders. In contrast, our
              review concentrates on young athletes and weight-control
              behaviour as a risk factor for eating disorders. An electronic
              search according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for
              Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) Statement was performed
              using Pubmed, PsychInfo and Spolit. The following search terms
              were used: weight-control, weight-control behaviour, weight gain,
              weight loss, pathogenic weight-control behaviour and
              weight-concerns, each of them combined with elite athlete, young
              elite athlete, adolescent elite athlete and elite sports.
              Overall, data are inconsistent. In general, athletes do not seem
              to be at a higher risk for pathogenic weight concerns and
              weight-control behaviour. It does seem to be more prevalent in
              leanness sports, though. There is evidence for pathogenic
              weight-control behaviour in both genders; male athletes mostly
              trying to gain weight whereas females emphasise weight reduction.
              There is not enough data to make predictions about connections
              with age of onset. Young elite athletes do show weight-control
              behaviour with varying degrees of frequency and severity. In
              particular, leanness sports seem to be a risk factor for weight
              manipulation. Further research is needed for more details and

               clinical and non-clinical groups, and in different cultural
               contexts. . METHODS: Recruitment involved both female patients
               with anorexia nervosa (AN) and healthy controls (HC) from Italy
               and Poland (N = 23 and N = 35 AN patients; and N = 39 and N = 39

              anorexia has been well established, little is known about the
              social consequences of ``clean dieting'' and orthorexia nervosa.
              In two studies, we examined the social stigma of clean dieting
              and orthorexia. METHOD: In Study 1, participants read a vignette
              describing a woman following a ``clean'' diet, a woman with
              anorexia, or a control target (minimal information about the
              individual). In Study 2, participants read a vignette describing
              a woman with orthorexia, a woman displaying identical orthorexic
              behaviors but without the orthorexia label, a woman with
              anorexia, or a control target. Participants then rated the target
              individual on a range of measures assessing stereotypes,
              emotions, and behavioral intentions toward the target. RESULTS:
              Study 1 found that the clean-dieting target was evaluated more
              negatively than the control target on some dimensions, but less
              negatively than the target with anorexia nervosa. Study 2 found
              that evaluations of the targets with orthorexia nervosa were more
              negative than evaluations of a control target, but did not differ
              from evaluations of the target with anorexia nervosa. Perceptions
              of the target's control over her behavior were associated with
              more positive evaluations (Studies 1 and 2), whereas perceptions
              of blame and responsibility for the condition were associated
              with more negative evaluations (Study 2). CONCLUSIONS: Overall,
              these findings highlight the potential negative social
              consequences of clean dieting and orthorexia nervosa, and point
              to perceptions of control and blame as potential mechanisms

              and causal mediation components of Beck's (1967, 1983) cognitive
              theory of depression. DESIGN: In order to allow for a stringent
              test of the aetiological component of Beck's theory, we used a
              short-term longitudinal design in which participants'
              dysfunctional attitudes were assessed prior to the occurrence of
              a negative event. METHODS: In all, 136 high school seniors
              applying to the University of Pennsylvania completed measures of
              depressed mood and dysfunctional attitudes 1-8 weeks before
              receiving their admissions decision (Time 1). The assessment of
              dysfunctional attitudes was preceded by a priming task designed
              to activate latent depressogenic schemata. Participants also
              completed measures of depressed mood, negative views of the self,
              and negative views of the future shortly after they received
              their admissions decision (Time 2) and four days later (Time 3).
              RESULTS: Consistent with the diathesis-stress component of Beck's
              theory, dysfunctional attitudes predicted increases in depressed
              mood immediately following a negative admissions outcome (Time
              2). In addition, consistent with the causal mediation component
              of the theory, in negative outcome students, the relationship
              between dysfunctional attitudes and increases in depressed mood
              was mediated by negative views of the future. Contrary to
              predictions, however, this relationship was not mediated by
              negative views of the self. In addition, contrary to predictions,
              dysfunctional attitudes did not predict enduring depressed mood
              after a negative outcome (Time 3). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with
              dysfunctional attitudes are likely to show increases in depressed
              mood following the occurrence of negative events. The
              relationship between dysfunctional attitudes and increases in
              depressed mood following the occurrence of negative events is
              mediated by negative views of the future.",

              so-called two-person psychologies in our field. The author begins
              by briefly describing a parallel to the recent history of
              psychoanalysis in the sudden rise and fall of scholastic
              philosophy in the 14th century. He then focuses on contemporary
              attacks on Freud's psychoanalysis as a science, based on the
              contention by two-person psychologists that free association by
              the patient and evenly hovering attention by the analyst are
              actually impossible. He reviews Freud's idea of psychoanalysis,
              discusses psychodynamic psychotherapy, both conceived as
              scientific treatment procedures, and describes the current
              assault on their metapsychological and epistemological
              foundations. Returning to the parallel between what happened to
              medieval scholasticism and what has happened to psychoanalysis,
              he examines why this happened, and the resulting fragmentation of
              psychoanalytic practice. The article concludes with suggestions
              for the integration of various schools of psychoanalysis,

              safety of SLI381 compared with placebo in the treatment of
              attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children in a
              naturalistic school and home setting. A secondary objective was
              to assess the diurnal variation in responses based on morning and
              afternoon assessments. METHODS: A multicenter, randomized,
              double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial was
              conducted at 47 sites. After a 1-week washout of any previous
              stimulant medication, patients were randomized to receive
              single-daily morning doses of placebo or SLI381 10 mg, 20 mg, or
              30 mg for 3 weeks. Participants aged 6 to 12 years inclusive who
              satisfied Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
              Fourth Edition criteria diagnosis of ADHD were included. The
              primary efficacy parameter was the Conners Global Index Scale for
              Teachers. Secondary efficacy parameters included the Conners
              Global Index Scale for Parents, the Clinical Global Impressions
              Scale for improvement, and the Parent Global Assessment for
              improvement. Safety was assessed by recording adverse events,
              laboratory tests, and vital signs at each visit during the study.
              Physical examinations and electrocardiograms were performed at
              the screening and the end of the study. RESULTS: Five hundred
              eighty-four children were randomized, 563 were included in the
              intent-to-treat population, and 509 completed the entire study.
              Intention-to-treat analysis of Conners Global Index Scale for
              Teachers and Conners Global Index Scale for Parents scores
              revealed significant improvement in morning, afternoon, and late
              afternoon behavior for all active treatment groups versus
              placebo. All active treatment groups showed significant
              dose-related improvement in behavior from baseline. Both the
              Clinical Global Impressions Scale for improvement and Parent
              Global Assessment for improvement showed all doses of SLI381 to
              be superior to placebo at treatment end and both confirmed the
              dose-response relationship between improvement and the SLI381
              dose. The incidence of spontaneously reported adverse events was
              low and similar for active treatments and placebo. CONCLUSIONS:
              SLI381 produced consistent, dose-related improvements on all
              measures of efficacy. The extended-release nature of the SLI381
              formulation was shown by continued, significant improvement in
              afternoon assessments by teachers and afternoon and late
              afternoon assessments by parents. The time course and therapeutic
              effects of SLI381 suggests that this medication is an efficacious
              once-daily treatment for children with ADHD.",

              health care providers use or are interested in using
              complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). People around the
              world rely on CAM, so similar issues face clinicians in many
              countries. In law, few cases have dealt with CAM use. The few
              that have apply the same general legal principles used in cases
              that involved conventional care while taking into account
              considerations unique to CAM. In ethics, as with conventional
              care, the issues surrounding pediatric CAM use usually involve
              questions about who the appropriate decision-makers are, on what
              ethical principles should clinical decision-making rely, and what
              obligations arise on the part of physicians and other health care
              providers. Clinical decision-making is made more complex by the
              relatively limited research on the efficacy and safety of CAM
              compared with conventional medicine, especially in children,
              which requires clinicians to make decisions under conditions of

               men); however, more men than women ate 1-2 meals daily (18.95\%
               men versus 7.9\% women). Both place of birth and field of study
               did not differ in terms of the number of meals. Moreover, it was
               observed that the number of meals per day was correlated with

               day on planning their diet in comparison with people who ate
               only 1-2 meals. Only 17.6\% of the respondents declared that

  abstract  = "A substantial body of evidence provides support (but not
               definitive proof of efficacy) for the use of antiretroviral
               agents as postexposure prophylaxis for occupational exposures to
               HIV in the healthcare workplace. Despite the lack of definitive
               evidence of the efficacy of these agents in this setting, over
               the past decade this intervention has become the standard of
               care for healthcare workers who sustain occupational exposures
               to HIV. Administration of these agents--even for a relatively
               short 28-day postexposure course--is often fraught with
               difficulty. All of the agents currently used for postexposure
               prophylaxis regimens have substantial adverse effects, and
               significant adverse effects occur in more than two-thirds of
               individuals electing prophylaxis. This manuscript reiterates
               current US Federal Government guidelines for the administration
               of postexposure prophylaxis, specifically noting that zidovudine
               plus lamivudine (with or without a protease inhibitor) remains
               the recommended regimen. The paper summarises the significant
               toxicities associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase
               inhibitors (primarily nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and bone
               marrow suppression), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
               inhibitors (rash, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms and
               hepatitis, including hepatic decompensation necessitating liver
               transplantation) and protease inhibitors (nausea, vomiting,
               diarrhoea, abdominal pain, hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia,
               headache and anorexia). As a class, the antiretroviral agents
               have an extraordinary number of drug interactions. The
               non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and the protease
               inhibitors are metabolised through the cytochrome P450 pathway,
               and the effects of concomitant administration of protease
               inhibitors with other agents in the same class are discussed, as
               well as the effects of concomitant administration of protease
               inhibitors with non-nucleoside agents. The potential for
               numerous and medically risky drug interactions emphasises the
               importance of planning antiretroviral prophylaxis in
               consultation with practitioners or clinical pharmacists who are
               skilled in the use of these agents and knowledgeable about the
               potential for significant drug interactions that could either
               reduce the benefit of prophylaxis or increase the potential for
               toxicity. Another common problem encountered by individuals
               managing postexposure prophylaxis programmes relates to the
               administration of chemoprophylaxis to a pregnant healthcare
               worker who has sustained an occupational exposure to HIV. We
               address what is known about the potential for toxicity and
               emphasise the recently published warning concerning the deaths

              serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) plays an important part in
              within-meal satiation and post-meal satiety processes. Thus, the
              serotonin system has provided a viable target for weight control,
              critical to the action of at least two effective anti-obesity
              treatments, both producing clinically significant weight loss
              over a year or more. Numerous serotonin receptor subtypes have
              been identified; of these, serotonin 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptors
              have been specifically recognised as mediators of
              serotonin-induced satiety.A number of serotonergic drugs,
              including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),
              dexfenfluramine and 5-HT2C receptor agonists, have been shown to
              significantly attenuate rodent bodyweight gain. This effect is
              strongly associated with marked hypophagia and is probably
              mediated by the hypothalamic melanocortin system. Additionally,
              sibutramine, dexfenfluramine, fluoxetine and the 5-HT2C receptor
              agonist chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) have all been shown to
              modify appetite in both lean and obese humans, resulting in
              reduced caloric intake. Clinical studies demonstrate serotonergic
              drugs specifically reduce appetite prior to and following the
              consumption of fixed caloric loads, and cause a reduction in
              pre-meal appetite and caloric intake at ad libitum meals. Weight
              loss in the obese has also been produced by treatment with both
              the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan and the preferential
              5-HT2C receptor agonist mCPP.A new generation of 5-HT2C receptor
              selective agonists have been developed and at least one,
              lorcaserin (APD356), is currently undergoing clinical trials. In
              addition, 5-HT6 receptor antagonists such as PRX-07034 and
              BVT74316 have been shown to potently reduce food intake and
              bodyweight gain in rodent models and have recently entered
              clinical trials. However, the role of the 5-HT6 receptor in the
              expression of appetite remains to be determined. The hope is that
              these drugs will not only be free of their predecessors' adverse
              effect profiles, but will also be equally or more effective at
              regulating appetite and controlling bodyweight.",

               contexts in which gays and lesbians have been and are defined by
               others and by themselves. Second, gay and lesbian families, are
               viewed intergenerationally, with each family member is
               influenced by the specific history and culture of his or her own
               family or origin in its sociocultural; context. Third, in family
               therapy, life-cycle ``stage'' theories have been central in the
               study of individual gay and lesbian identity and development.
               Some attention has more recently turned to the the life cycle of
               the gay couple and of the lesbian family. Then, some of the
               dimensions and metaphors that have been of interest to family
               theorists are considered. Questions are addressed throughout the
               chapter: What can we say at present about family structure and
               process and about how these families are doing? How relevant are
               concepts such as boundary, enmeshment, fusion, and cohesion?
               What can these families teach us about heterosexual families,
               about gender identity and relationships? Do such families have
               unique strengths and face unique kinds of problems? The chapter
               concludes with a brief commentary on what the author sees as

              Cosmetic Act in 1938 and escalating with the 1962 Kefauver-Harris
              amendments, increasing pressure has been placed on pharmaceutical
              manufacturers to demonstrate that a drug's benefits outweigh its
              risks. Nowhere has the question of risk versus benefit come under
              greater scrutiny than with anorectics. After the approval in the
              1940s and 1950s of a number of amphetamine and amphetamine-like
              compounds for the treatment of obesity, the U.S. Food and Drug
              Administration struggled to define the efficacy and safety of
              these agents. Labeling restrictions on duration of use and
              warnings about abuse and addiction ultimately contributed to the
              reduced use of anorectics. That trend continued until the
              mid-1990s, when the off-label use of fenfluramine plus
              phentermine (fen-phen) and the approval of dexfenfluramine gave
              rise to widespread, long-term use of anorectics to treat obesity.
              The adverse effects that came to be associated with fenfluramine
              and dexfenfluramine, leading to their eventual withdrawal from
              the market, gave pause to regulators, physicians, patients, and
              drug companies alike. Sibutramine, the latest anorectic to enter
              the market, is now the focus of a landmark trial that is
              examining, for the first time, whether drug-induced weight loss
              reduces the risk for fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease.",

               eating habits that compromise physical and mental health. These
               conditions are seen in small percentages of the population in
               both men and women, but many of these disorders such as anorexia
               nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and orthorexia nervosa are seen within
               the athlete population. The majority of athletes are considered
               to be very healthy in terms of BMI, however in many sports,
               coaches and peers can place a strong emphasis on the importance
               of attaining unrealistic weights in order to excel. This can
               significantly impact the athlete's relationship with food and
               lead to a distorted body image. This review looked at how
               different categories of restricted eating and eating disorders
               cause long-term deterioration of sport performance due to
               subsequent muscle deterioration. Athletes and coaches should be

               athletic performance and how to deal with the stress of the lean
               culture of certain sports. Motivating athletes to improve other
               aspects of the sport such as fitness, strength, and endurance
               are healthier ways to improve performance without emphasising

              mg in the morning) and placebo (in the evening) were administered
              for 24 weeks. Group II (n = 34) received fluoxetine (20 mg in the
              morning) and melatonin (5 mg in the evening) in the same period

              index (BMI) were used to assess the health status and the

  author    = "Scrinis, Gyorgy",
  abstract  = "Popularized by Michael Pollan in his best-selling In Defense of
               Food, Gyorgy Scrinis's concept of nutritionism refers to the
               reductive understanding of nutrients as the key indicators of
               healthy food -- an approach that has dominated nutrition
               science, dietary advice, and food marketing. Scrinis argues this
               ideology has narrowed and in some cases distorted our
               appreciation of food quality, such that even highly processed
               foods may be perceived as healthful depending on their content
               of ``good'' or ``bad'' nutrients. Investigating the butter
               versus margarine debate, the battle between low-fat, low-carb,
               and other weight-loss diets, and the food industry's strategic
               promotion of nutritionally enhanced foods, Scrinis reveals the
               scientific, social, and economic factors driving our modern
               fascination with nutrition.Scrinis develops an original
               framework and terminology for analyzing the characteristics and
               consequences of nutritionism since the late nineteenth century.
               He begins with the era of quantification, in which the idea of
               protective nutrients, caloric reductionism, and vitamins'
               curative effects took shape. He follows with the era of good and
               bad nutritionism, which set nutricentric dietary guidelines and
               defined the parameters of unhealthy nutrients; and concludes
               with our current era of functional nutritionism, in which the
               focus has shifted to targeted nutrients, superfoods, and optimal
               diets. Scrinis's research underscores the critical role of
               nutrition science and dietary advice in shaping our relationship
               to food and our bodies and in heightening our nutritional
               anxieties. He ultimately shows how nutritionism has aligned the
               demands and perceived needs of consumers with the commercial
               interests of food manufacturers and corporations. Scrinis also
               offers an alternative paradigm for assessing the healthfulness
               of foods -- the food quality paradigm -- that privileges food
               production and processing quality, cultural-traditional
               knowledge, and sensual-practical experience, and promotes less

               ``pure'' or ``healthy'' foods. Despite emergent interest, few

               examined the phenomenology, correlates, and associated
               impairment of orthorexia in 404 undergraduate students. A
               battery of self-report questionnaires assessed orthorexia
               symptoms, related functional impairment, disordered eating,
               perfectionism, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, appearance
               anxiety, fear of negative evaluation, anxiety, and depressive
               symptoms. In total, 35.4\% of participants endorsed elevated
               orthorexia symptoms, with primary concerns related to guilt
               associated with dietary transgressions and experiencing control
               when eating in a desired manner. Orthorexia symptoms
               demonstrated small to medium correlations with associated
               impairment variables, perfectionism, disordered eating,

              problems, and feelings as well as to determine whether there are
              any differences between genders and among different age-groups.
              The research instrument was an Eating Habits Questionnaire (EHQ)
              which consisted of 35 items. There were 382 respondents involved
              in the study. The reliability and factor structure of the
              questionnaire were verified by using factor analysis. The results
              of MANOVA showed that there is a significant difference in the
              habits concerning healthy eating between men and women [F
              (3,378)=4.26, p=0.006; Wilks' Lambda=0.97]. When the results for
              the dependent variables (knowledge, problems, and feelings) were
              considered separately, it was determined that there is no
              significant difference between men and women, which confirms the
              results of the t-test. The effect of age on the three dimensions
              of healthy eating habits was examined within three age-groups, by
              using ANOVA. The results showed that knowledge about healthy
              eating increases with age [F (2,379)=6.14, p=0.002] as well as
              positive feelings which occur as a result of healthy eating [F
              (2,379)=3.66, p=0.027]. Unlike ANOVA, MANOVA showed difference
              among the age-groups only when it came to the 'knowledge'
              variable. This study is important as it shows the current state
              of awareness on healthy eating habits in the researched populace

              Fluoxetine injections during ad libitum feeding led to depressed

              initial 10 days of treatment with full recovery of both intake

  abstract  = "Background: Orthorexia nervosa is the pathological obsession for
               consuming only biologically pure food that may lead to the
               development of specific ritualistic attitudes towards food
               preparation and the restriction of specific food groups that can
               be harmful to one's health (Zamora et al., 2005; Matera, 2012).
               Aim: Due to the rise in popularity with Instagram and online
               eating disorder communities, and the potential negative outcomes
               on psychosocial health, the purpose of this descriptive study
               was to investigate images tagged with \#orthorexia on Instagram
               over 7 days. Methods: A mixed methods approach was utilized for
               this study. A text analysis was conducted using the Netlytic
               program (Gruzd, 2016) to explore for emerging themes of
               discussion specifically using word count frequency, and a
               network analysis using both a name network (i.e., who mentions
               whom) and a chain network (i.e., who replies to whom) was
               performed. Among a subsample of images, author/image information
               was manually obtained, and a coding scheme (adapted from
               Tiggemann and Zaccardo, 2016) was implemented for a subsample of
               images (results pending). Results: Among the 4,533 records
               downloaded, there were 48,780 unique words associated with the
               posts (in the description of the picture or in the comment
               section). Majority of most commonly used words were associated
               with eating disorder recovery (i.e., 425 instances of
               \#edrecovery; 340 instances of \#recovery; 297 instances of
               \#eatingdisorderrecovery). The chain network/direct interactions
               analysis indicated a large online presence with 1,503 nodes
               (i.e., users) and 1,803 ties (i.e., direct replies between
               users). The coding of \#orthorexia images is pending but will
               help us further understand the orthorexia online community.
               Conclusions: As the network analysis and text analysis suggested
               an eating disorder recovery theme, this suggests that Instagram
               may be being used as a supportive and interactive community for
               those who have/had symptoms of orthorexia.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening
              syndrome that is precipitated by the use of serotonergic drugs
              and overactivation of both the peripheral and central
              postsynaptic 5HT-1A and, most notably, 5HT-2A receptors. This
              syndrome consists of a combination of mental status changes,
              neuromuscular hyperactivity, and autonomic hyperactivity.
              Serotonin syndrome can occur via the therapeutic use of
              serotonergic drugs alone, an intentional overdose of serotonergic
              drugs, or classically, as a result of a complex drug interaction
              between two serotonergic drugs that work by different mechanisms.
              A multitude of drug combinations can result in serotonin
              syndrome. METHODS: This review describes the presentation and
              management of serotonin syndrome and discusses the drugs and
              interactions that can precipitate this syndrome with the goal of
              making physicians more alert and aware of this potentially fatal
              yet preventable syndrome. CONCLUSION: Many commonly used
              medications have proven to be the culprits of serotonin syndrome.
              Proper education and awareness about serotonin syndrome will
              improve the accuracy of diagnosis and promote the institution of
              the appropriate treatment that may prevent significant morbidity
              and mortality.",

              (FVII) activity and antigen levels we studied a polymorphism
              located in the 5' region of the gene (5'F7), an intronic mutation
              (IVS7), and the 353Arg-Gln polymorphism. All the polymorphisms,
              which showed strong allelic association, analyzed separately or
              in combination by the one-way analysis of variance, were
              associated with significantly different FVII levels. The 5'F7 and
              353Arg-Gln polymorphic systems, which have very similar allele
              frequencies, contributed to a similar extent to the total
              phenotypic variance, whereas the contribution of the IVS7
              polymorphism was lower. Genetic variation at the FVII locus,
              evaluated on combined genotypes, accounted for up to 40\% of the
              phenotype FVII variance. As also shown by the two-way analysis of
              variance, the use of two out of three markers is advisable, and
              since the 5'F7 polymorphism can be screened by a simple
              immunoassay, it should be preferred for population-based studies.
              No substantial differences between FVII activity and FVII antigen
              levels were found, thus suggesting that the variation was due to
              biosynthesis- or stability-mediated mechanisms. The genetic
              control of FVII levels described in this study plays an important
              role in determining plasma FVII level variability, which may
              influence the hemostatic balance.",
