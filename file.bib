  abstract  = "Over the last two decades we have witnessed an emerging set of
               conditions in schools which render them contexts replete with
               social messages about the body, health, and self. Research has
               suggested that both the formal and informal contexts of
               education are heavily imbued with a ?culture of healthism? which
               places moral obligation and blame on individuals for their
               health/problem. In this paper we explore the ways in which young
               women with eating disorders constructed their identities within
               and against the various ?health? discourses now found within
               schools. Data is presented from life history interviews with
               young women who have been diagnosed with anorexia and/or bulimia
               who were resident at a leading centre for the treatment of
               eating disorders in the UK. The experiences of the young women
               in the study point towards the ways in which schools, despite
               their best intentions, are implicated in constructing contexts
               which are inimical to the well-being of young women who have
               been diagnosed with anorexia or bulimia and perhaps others who
               are making sense of their bodies, health, and selves in these

               disorders, specifically, anorexia nervosa (AN) in young women
               and girls. In so doing, it also touches on other relationships
               relatively under explored in the sociology of education, between
               formal education and ?the middle class?. Our analyses point to
               the ways in which social trends outside schools relating to ?the
               body? and health generate and intersect with what we refer to as
               performance and perfection codes following Bernstein (2000) and
               Evans and Davies (2004). These create conditions of school work

               deeply damaging to the identities and health of the vulnerable

               of the young people in our study, is for greater understanding
               of the ways in which formal education and schooling may be
               implicated in the production of disordered eating and

              article explores the findings from focus groups conducted with 63
              members of staff from 29 UK schools with the aims of (i)
              understanding whether they are in a good position to support

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Weight-related bullying is prevalent among youth and
              associated with adverse health consequences, including increased
              risk for body dissatisfaction and disordered eating behaviors,
              which are risk factors for eating disorders. Although concerns
              about these problems have stimulated calls for broader
              intervention efforts in schools, actions thus far have been
              limited. This study examined educators' perspectives about
              potential policy actions to address these issues in schools.
              METHODS: Educators (N = 240) completed an online questionnaire
              assessing their support for 11 potential school-based policy
              actions to address weight-related bullying and eating disorders.
              Participants also rated policies according to their feasibility
              and potential for positive impact. RESULTS: Forty-eight percent
              of participants observed weight-related bullying in their school
              and 99\% expressed the importance of intervening in such
              incidents. A large majority (75\%-94\%) supported 8 of the 11
              policies, especially actions requiring school-based health
              curriculum to include content on eating disorder prevention
              (94\%), and addressing weight-bullying through antibullying
              policies (92\%), staff training (89\%), and school curriculum
              (89\%). Strongly supported policies were viewed by participants
              as being the most impactful and feasible to implement.
              CONCLUSIONS: Educators recognize weight-related bullying and

               literature regarding diagnoses similarities, presentation
               uniqueness, assessment/assessment tools, and suggested
               treatments of ON. METHOD/DESIGN: A literature search of four

               was conducted to evaluate the status of the literature on

              In two studies, we examined the social stigma of clean dieting
              and orthorexia. METHOD: In Study 1, participants read a vignette
              describing a woman following a ``clean'' diet, a woman with
              anorexia, or a control target (minimal information about the
              individual). In Study 2, participants read a vignette describing
              a woman with orthorexia, a woman displaying identical orthorexic
              behaviors but without the orthorexia label, a woman with
              anorexia, or a control target. Participants then rated the target
              individual on a range of measures assessing stereotypes,
              emotions, and behavioral intentions toward the target. RESULTS:
              Study 1 found that the clean-dieting target was evaluated more
              negatively than the control target on some dimensions, but less
              negatively than the target with anorexia nervosa. Study 2 found
              that evaluations of the targets with orthorexia nervosa were more
              negative than evaluations of a control target, but did not differ
              from evaluations of the target with anorexia nervosa. Perceptions
              of the target's control over her behavior were associated with
              more positive evaluations (Studies 1 and 2), whereas perceptions
              of blame and responsibility for the condition were associated
              with more negative evaluations (Study 2). CONCLUSIONS: Overall,
              these findings highlight the potential negative social
              consequences of clean dieting and orthorexia nervosa, and point

              Our paper notes the important contribution of school educators
              whilst warning of the current need to specifically examine how
              teachers and school personnel may be best trained and prepared

              and able to undertake such a role, and whether some groups of
              teachers may be personally susceptible to body image and eating
              problems. It is vital to understand the knowledge, behaviors,
              attitudes, and expectations of educators implementing prevention
              programs in order to ensure that they are personally and
              professionally capable of carrying out prevention initiatives in

              (8-bromo-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]benzodiazepine;
              the triazolo-analogue of flubromazepam), has been offered on the
              Internet from 2014 on. The purpose of the present study was to
              assess the time frame of detectability in biological samples
              along with preliminary basic pharmacokinetic parameters of the
              designer benzodiazepine flubromazolam. To investigate these one
              of the authors ingested a capsule containing 0.5 mg of the drug.
              Metabolism studies and suitability tests for the detection with
              immunochemical assays where performed with the samples obtained
              from the self-experiment and 5 authentic case samples.
              Flubromazolam and its' mono-hydroxylated metabolite were
              detectable by LC-MS/MS in urine for up to 6.5 and 8 days,
              respectively (LLOQ flubromazolam: 0.1 ng/ml). Peak serum
              concentrations were as low as 8 ng/ml (8 h post ingestion).
              Glucuronides were also detected. The terminal elimination
              half-life could be estimated in the range of 10-20 h.
              Immunochemical assays yielded negative results for serum samples
              and positive results for urine samples for up to five days post
              ingestion. The presented data demonstrates the detectability of a
              single uptake of 0.5 mg of flubromazolam in hair samples
              collected two weeks after drug uptake by LC-MS3 (cmax 0.6 pg/mg;
              LOD 0.01 pg/mg). The detected metabolites were in good agreement
              with those described in other studies.",

              lessons can be drawn from the study of the full transmission
              dynamics of its causative agent-severe acute respiratory syndrome
              coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)- in Wuhan (China), where vigorous
              non-pharmaceutical interventions have suppressed the local
              outbreak of this disease1. Here we use a modelling approach to
              reconstruct the full-spectrum dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan
              between 1 January and 8 March 2020 across 5 periods defined by
              events and interventions, on the basis of 32,583
              laboratory-confirmed cases1. Accounting for presymptomatic
              infectiousness2, time-varying ascertainment rates, transmission
              rates and population movements3, we identify two key features of
              the outbreak: high covertness and high transmissibility. We
              estimate 87\% (lower bound, 53\%) of the infections before 8
              March 2020 were unascertained (potentially including asymptomatic
              and mildly symptomatic individuals); and a basic reproduction
              number (R0) of 3.54 (95\% credible interval 3.40-3.67) in the
              early outbreak, much higher than that of severe acute respiratory
              syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)4,5.
              We observe that multipronged interventions had considerable
              positive effects on controlling the outbreak, decreasing the
              reproduction number to 0.28 (95\% credible interval 0.23-0.33)
              and-by projection-reducing the total infections in Wuhan by
              96.0\% as of 8 March 2020. We also explore the probability of
              resurgence following the lifting of all interventions after 14
              consecutive days of no ascertained infections; we estimate this
              probability at 0.32 and 0.06 on the basis of models with 87\% and
              53\% unascertained cases, respectively-highlighting the risk
              posed by substantial covert infections under changing control
              measures. These results have important implications when
              considering strategies of continuing surveillance and

              memory T cells in humans with the potential to recognize
              SARS-CoV-2. Here, we first studied T cell responses to structural

              ORF1) regions of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 convalescents (n=36). In
              all of them we demonstrated the presence of CD4 and CD8 T cells
              recognizing multiple regions of the NP protein. We then showed
              that SARS-recovered patients (n=23) still possess long-lasting
              memory T cells reactive to SARS-NP 17 years after the 2003
              outbreak, which displayed robust cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2
              NP. Surprisingly, we also frequently detected SARS-CoV-2 specific
              T cells in individuals with no history of SARS, COVID-19 or
              contact with SARS/COVID-19 patients (n=37). SARS-CoV-2 T cells in
              uninfected donors exhibited a different pattern of
              immunodominance, frequently targeting the ORF-1-coded proteins
              NSP7 and 13 as well as the NP structural protein. Epitope
              characterization of NSP7-specific T cells showed recognition of
              protein fragments with low homology to ``common cold'' human
