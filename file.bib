               possible to be a counselling psychologist in non-traditional
               settings, and (b) the potential integration of counselling
               psychology foci with the medical model, there has been some
               discussion about whether counselling psychologists who practice
               in health care settings might experience a change in their
               professional identity. Professional identity is defined here as
               a sense of connection to the values and emphases of counselling
               psychology. The retention of professional identity seems
               important for counselling psychologists in health care settings.
               This is considering that the application of counselling
               psychology principles has the potential to make their
               contributions unique among mental health professionals in the
               health care arena. Here, the authors describe the evolution of
               ?counselling health psychology? and address issues of

              literature in primary care in order to identify which
              intervention provider has been used to date and their relative
              effectiveness for increasing PA. METHOD: MEDLINE and PsycINFO
              databases were searched for PA intervention studies in primary
              care settings. RESULTS: Of the 19 studies, 37\% were conducted
              solely by physicians, 37\% by allied health professionals, while
              26\% were combined-provider interventions. There was a decline in
              the number of physician-only interventions and a shift towards
              interventions offered by allied health professionals as adjuncts
              or alone. Interventions across all provider categories generated
              some improvements in physical activity behavior, however, it
              appears that allied health professionals as adjuncts or alone
              produced the best results in the long-term (>6 months). There was
              substantial variation in the location and counseling approach

              an interdisciplinary model in which physicians recommend PA and
              provide referrals to allied health professionals such as physical
              activity counselors. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: With physical
              activity counselors' specialized training and greater time

  title    = "Provide, provide: the economics of aging",
  abstract = "Most older persons face two potentially serious economic
              problems: (a) declining earning power and (b) declining health
              that can be partly offset by increased utilization of health
              care. The decline in earning power is largely attributable to
              physiological changes and to obsolescence of skills and
              knowledge. These adverse effects are exacerbated by public and
              private policies that reduce the incentives of older persons to
              continue work and increase the cost to employers of employing
              older workers. The problems of earnings replacement and health
              care payment are usually discussed separately, but there are
              several reasons why they should be considered together. First,
              there are often tradeoffs between the two. Money is money, and
              for most people there is never enough to go around. This is
              self-evident where private funds are concerned. Low-income
              elderly, for instance, frequently must choose between expensive
              prescription drugs and an adequate diet. For middle-income
              elderly, the choice may be between saving on medigap insurance or
              forgoing an airplane trip to a grandchild's graduation. Difficult
              choices are also inherent in the allocation of public funds. The
              same tax receipts that could be used to maintain or increase
              retirement benefits could be used to fund additional care, and
              vice versa. In discussing these tradeoffs, some analysts assert
              that people will gladly give up other goods and services for
              medical care that cures illness, relieves pain, or restores
              function. Others believe that some people would forgo some health
              insurance in order to maintain access to other goods and
              services. A second reason for looking at the two problems
              together is that they pose similar questions for public policy.
              How much should each generation provide for its own needs in old
              age, and how much should be provided by the generations that
              follow? How much provision should be voluntary, how much
              compulsory? How much intra-generational redistribution is
              appropriate after age 65? How well can private markets serve the
              elderly's desire for annuities and health insurance, and when are
              public programs more efficient? Finally, the problem of health
              care payment is approaching that of earning replacement in
              economic importance and, by 2020, will far exceed it. Declining
              health after age 65 results in substantial increase in use of
              prescription drugs, hospital admissions, repair or replacement of
              parts of the body, rehabilitation and physical therapy, and
              assistance with activities of daily living. New technologies
              offer great promise for offsetting the health problems of aging,
              but often at considerable expense. Overall, per capita
              expenditures for health care after age 65 are between three and
              four times as great as for those under 65. This presentation will
              focus primarily on the (thus far) inexorable increase in
              consumption of health care by older Americans. If this increase
              continues and if the government's share of the total remains
              unchanged, the tax burden on younger cohorts could become
              intolerable. Concomitantly, if the private share remains
              unchanged, the ability of the elderly to obtain other goods and
              services would be sharply diminished. Although the emphasis of
              the session will be on aggregate and average results, levels and
              trends in income inequality among the elderly will also be
              examined and compared with inequality at younger ages. The
              session will conclude with a discussion of changes that might
              avert the economic and social crises foreshadowed in the data.",

              of caregiving, however, follows a gendered pattern. Specifically,
              the spouse provides assistance to older men, whereas daughters
              provide assistance to older women. Grandchildren and
              noncoresident family members, to some extent, are also active in
              providing care to older Filipinos. DISCUSSION: The Filipino
              family remains faithful to its filial duty toward older persons,
              but who provides care and the way it is provided are likely to
              change due to the demographic changes and values shifts that have
              swept the country.",

              aging alternative to chronological age, we explored the
              association between subjective age, on the one hand, and having
              grandchildren and provision of grandchild care, on the other, by
              gender and age groups. METHOD: Data from the Health and
              Retirement Study (HRS; N = 1,701 men and 2,395 women aged 50-85)
              and linear regression models were used to test two hypotheses.
              RESULTS: Grandparents feel older than their grandchildless
              counterparts at younger ages, but such association is reversed in
              later life if they look after their grandchildren. A cumulative
              negative association between subjective age and both having
              grandchildren and providing grandchild care holds for older
              women. DISCUSSION: This study extends prior research by examining
              age and gender differences in factors associated with subjective
              age. The findings suggest that grandparenthood is central in
              shaping the personal experience of aging. Future studies should

              living in Nepal in 2010; of these 5,000 AIDS orphans were in need
              of immediate support. The objective of this study was to
              investigate which model of care and support is more appropriate
              for improving psychosocial and economic security of AIDS orphans.
              METHODS: With the documented 5200 cases of AIDS orphans from 42
              districts at National Association of People Living with HIV, we
              purposively selected five districts - one from each development
              region, based on the highest number of AIDS orphans reported.
              From five districts, 56 HIV positive double orphans aged 8-18
              years and their 42 caregivers were interviewed to find their
              psychosocial and economic situation. RESULTS: Thirty nine (70\%)
              orphans were found living in kinship care, while 17(30\%) were
              living in institutional care homes. Orphans living in kinship
              were more optimistic, as they were backed by their close
              relatives 35 (90\%), had birth certificates 35 (90\%), ensured
              inherent family property 21 (54\%), obtained basic needs like
              food, education and shelter from grandparents 23 (59\%), and had
              more than five friends who visited their homes 26 (67\%). While,
              the orphans living in institutional care homes 17(30\%) had no
              birth certificates, fewer contacts with siblings 2 (12\%), and
              none had friends outside the care homes. CONCLUSIONS: Kinship
              care is better model for psychosocial and economic security for
              AIDS orphans in Nepal, rather than institutional care. Families
              can provide good protection to AIDS orphans if government
              provides minimum support to them.",

              collected and analysed using qualitative methodologies of
              critical medical anthropology. Sixty detailed case studies were
              completed, each based on an extended open-ended interview with
              patient guardians. Two positive drivers in seeking treatment for
              clubfoot were identified: a desire to correct the impairment; and
              a direct instruction to do so, usually from a health-care
              professional. Four main barriers prevented treatment seeking:
              lack of knowledge about the condition and its treatment; familial
              resistance; logistical obstacles; and socio-economic pressures.
              In delivering effective health care, organizations should seek to
              minimize barriers and their impact, whilst maximizing drivers

              several living generations; it analyses patterns of care and paid
              work across the generations and the resource transfers which take
              place between generations. Drawing on a small-scale study of four
              generation families, it provides a typology of intergenerational
              relations with respect to the transmission of material assets,
              childcare and elder care, sociability, emotional support, and
              values. It examines two a fortiori conditions which are
              considered to shape intergenerational relations: (a) occupational
              status continuity/mobility and (b) geographical
              proximity/mobility. Four types of intergenerational relations are
              generated by this examination: traditional solidaristic;
              differentiated; incorporation of difference; and reparation in
              estrangement. The paper looks at families holistically and draws
              on the concept of ambivalence to describe the forces which push
              family members to carry on family patterns and those which pull
              them apart and lead them to strike out on their own. It shows

              to formal volunteering among older adults. METHOD: Logistic
              regression is used to examine the likelihood of volunteering
              based on grandchild care using data from the 2004 wave of the
              Health and Retirement Study (n = 13,785). Longitudinal analyses
              utilize treatment effects models to examine changes in
              volunteering for grandparents who begin nonresidential grandchild
              care between the 2004 and 2008 waves (n = 10,811). RESULTS:
              Results show that grandparents raising coresidential
              grandchildren have lower odds of volunteering than grandparents
              providing no regular grandchild care. However, grandparents who
              provide nonresidential grandchild care are more likely to
              volunteer than grandparents not providing grandchild care and
              those raising a coresidential grandchild. Grandparents who
              provide nonresidential care for grandchildren engage in more
              volunteering before assuming grandchild care, and their
              volunteerism increases after becoming a caregiver for a
              grandchild. DISCUSSION: Consistent with resource theory and the
              accumulation of roles, providing nonresidential grandchild care
              may draw grandparents into formal volunteer activity. The lower
              human capital resources evidenced by grandparents raising
              coresidential grandchildren may play a role in their lower
              likelihood of formal volunteering.",

              the full range of current interventions for reducing caregiver
              stress. METHODS: Applying a broad definition of caregiver stress,
              a systematic search of three scientific databases (CINAHL, Embase
              and Ovid Medline), a general internet search and hand searching
              of key peer-reviewed articles were conducted. Inclusion criteria
              were as follows: (i) published in English between 2004-2016; (ii)
              focused on familial caregivers, defined as parents, siblings or
              extended family; (iii) targeted children/youth with medical
              complexity between the ages of 1-24 years; and (iv) described an
              intervention and impact on caregiver stress. Data on type of
              intervention, study design and methods, measures and overall
              findings were extracted. RESULTS: Forty-nine studies were
              included from a list of 22 339 unique titles. Six domains of
              interventions were found: care coordination models (n = 23);
              respite care (n = 8); telemedicine (n = 5); peer and emotional
              support (n = 6); insurance and employment benefits (n = 4); and
              health and related supports (n = 3). Across studies, there was a
              wide variety of designs, outcomes and measures used. CONCLUSIONS:
              Positive findings of reductions in caregiver stress were noted
              within an emerging body of evidence on effective interventions
              for families of children with medical complexity. A commonality
              across domains was a significant focus on streamlining services
              and reducing the burden of care related to varied pressures
              experienced, including time, finances, care needs and service
              access, among others. There was non-conclusive evidence however
              around which of the six identified intervention domains or
              combination thereof are most effective for reducing stress. These
              promising findings demonstrate that stress reduction is possible
              with the right support and that multiple interventions may be
              effective in reducing burdens of care experienced by families of
              children with medical complexity.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Preserving aging cognition improves quality of life
              and delays dementia onset. Previous studies have shown that
              social engagement can maintain cognition; however, none has
              examined the effects of grandparenting, an important role among
              postmenopausal women. This study aims to examine the role of
              grandparenting in cognition among postmenopausal women. METHODS:
              Participants were 186 Australian women from the longitudinal
              prospective Women's Healthy Aging Project. Cognition was assessed
              using the Symbol-Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), California Verbal
              Learning Test, and Tower of London. RESULTS: Amount of time spent
              minding grandchildren predicted differences in SDMT performance
              (P < 0.01). The highest cognitive scores for most tests were seen
              in participants who minded grandchildren for 1 day/week. Minding
              grandchildren for 1 day/week was also a significant positive
              predictor of California Verbal Learning Test immediate recall
              performance (P < 0.05). However, minding grandchildren for 5 days
              or more per week predicted lower SDMT performance (P < 0.05).
              CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the highest cognitive
              performance is demonstrated by postmenopausal women who spend 1
              day/week minding grandchildren; however, minding grandchildren
              for 5 days or more per week predicts lower working memory
              performance and processing speed. These results indicate that
              highly frequent grandparenting predicts lower cognitive
              performance.",

              adult child on depressive symptoms among older widowed women in
              South Korea. METHOD: Data from the first (2006) and second (2008)
              waves of the Korea Longitudinal Study of Ageing were used. The
              analysis was restricted to widowed women aged >/=65 years with at
              least one living child (N = 2,446). We used an instrumental
              variables (IVs) estimation exploiting two child characteristics
              as IVs (the number of sons and whether the eldest child is a
              daughter). Specification tests for IVs showed that these
              instruments predict the probability of an older widowed woman's
              coresidence with an adult child but do not directly affect
              depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Our IV two-stage least-squares
              estimator suggested that coresidence with an adult child has a
              protective effect on depressive symptoms among older widowed
              women in South Korea. Coresidence was found to be endogenous in
              our statistical model of depressive symptoms. DISCUSSION: The IV
              estimation method can be a useful approach to addressing the
              potential endogeneity between intergenerational coresidence and
              elderly health. Rapidly decreasing rates of intergenerational

              Although it is widely accepted that meaningful family

              relationships between grandfathers and grandchildren as being

              their frequency of contact, level of commitment, and
              participation in activities with grandchildren. Comparative
              analyses indicate that involved grandfathers had fewer depressive

              children under 15 years old had a father or mother who had died;
              5\% of orphans had lost both parents. Orphan prevalence was
              highest in a peri-urban rural area (17.2\%) and lowest in a
              middle income medium density urban suburb (4.3\%). Recent
              increases in parental deaths were noted; 50\% of parental deaths
              since 1987 could be ascribed to AIDS. Orphan household heads were
              likely to be older and less well-educated than non-orphan
              household heads. The majority of orphaned children were being
              cared for satisfactorily within extended families, often under
              difficult circumstances. Caregiving by maternal relatives
              represents a departure from the traditional practice of caring
              for orphans within the paternal extended family and an adaptation
              of community-coping mechanisms. There was little evidence of
              discrimination or exploitation of orphaned children by extended
              family caregivers. The fact that community coping mechanisms are
              changing does not imply that extended family methods of caring
              are about to break down. However, the emergence of orphan
              households headed by siblings is an indication that the extended

              supporting extended families by utilizing existing
              community-based organizations. Orphan support programmes may need
              to be established initially in high risk communities such as
              low-income urban areas and peri-urban rural areas. In 1992 in
              Zimbabwe, local women conducted interviews with 570 heads of
              household and focus group discussions with caregivers, community
              members, and teachers in and near Mutare (Zimunya, Sakubva, and
              Dangamvura) to determine the prevalence of orphans. 220 orphans
              (12.8\% of all children surveyed) lived in 18.3\% of all the
              households. The prevalence of orphans was lowest in the
              newly-developed, affluent suburb of Dangamvura and highest in the
              very low income, rural area of Zimunya (4.3\% vs. 17.1\%). It
              increased with age (4.9\% for under-fives, 10.1\% for 5-9 years,
              and 23.9\% for 10-14 years). Most orphans (81.8\%) had only lost
              their father. Based on verbal autopsy information, gender, age of
              parent at death, and year of deaths, researchers did not classify
              any deaths before 1987 as being caused by possible or probable
              AIDS. They identified 14 cases of possible AIDS and 14 cases of
              probable AIDS during 1987-1992, however. Only one household
              actually reported AIDS as the cause of death of a parent. AIDS
              was likely the cause of death for 32\% of cases. The average age
              for parents dying before 1987 was 45.7 years compared to 34.3
              years after 1987. A member of the maternal family headed up 84\%
              of orphan households, while a member of the paternal family
              headed up only 16\%. Yet, traditionally the father's side,
              especially the paternal aunt, cares for orphans. In three cases,
              the older sister aged 17-23 cared for younger siblings,
              suggesting that the extended family is under stress. Communities
              stigmatized and discriminated against orphans. Caregivers showed
              genuine concern for the orphans. Few differences in health,
              nutrition, and education between orphaned and nonorphaned
              children supported this concern. Community-based groups,
              particularly those in low income urban areas and periurban rural
              areas, should support extended families to prevent rupture of
              stressed community coping mechanisms. eng",

              experimentally induced pain have been widely reported.
              Specifically, females are at greater risk for developing several
              chronic pain disorders, and women exhibit greater sensitivity to
              noxious stimuli in the laboratory compared with men. Several
              mechanisms have been proposed to account for these sex
              differences. Psychosocial factors such as sex role beliefs, pain
              coping strategies, mood, and pain-related expectancies may
              underlie these effects. In addition, there is evidence that
              familial factors can alter pain responses, and these
              intergenerational influences may differ as a function of sex. Sex
              hormones are also known to affect pain responses, which may
              mediate the sex differences. Although the magnitude of these
              effects has not been well characterized, there are potentially
              important practical implications of sex differences in pain

              in different interpretations of a youth's behavior. Theoretical
              explanations for discrepancies typically rely on scale level
              analyses. This article explores whether caregivers and
              adolescents differ in when they notice and report symptoms of
              youth mania depending on the severity of overall manic
              disturbance. METHOD: Participants were 459 adolescent-caregiver
              pairs recruited at either a community mental health center or an
              academic medical center. Adolescents were most likely to have a
              primary diagnosis of unipolar depression (37\%) or
              attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder/disruptive behavior
              disorder (36\%). Nineteen percent of adolescents received a
              bipolar spectrum disorder diagnosis (4\% bipolar I and 15\%
              bipolar II, cyclothymia, or bipolar not otherwise specificed).
              Caregivers were primarily biological mothers (74\%) or
              grandparents (8\%). Adolescents and caregivers independently
              completed the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) about the
              adolescent. RESULTS: Item response theory analyses of the entire
              sample indicated that in general, both caregivers and adolescents
              reserved endorsement of mania symptoms for the most severely ill
              half of participants. Comparisons of caregiver and adolescent
              report of symptoms on the MDQ indicated two significant
              differences. Caregivers were more likely to report irritability
              at significantly lower severity of mania than adolescents.
              Adolescents endorsed only increased energy or hyperactivity at
              lower severities than caregivers. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents and
              caregivers will have different concerns and might report
              different symptoms consistent with whom the symptom impacts
              first. Caregivers are more likely to report behaviors such as
              irritability, whereas adolescents are more likely to report

              million orphaned children. The growing orphan crisis has
              overwhelmed many communities and has weakened the ability of
              extended families to meet traditional care-taking expectations.
              Other models of care and support have emerged in sub-Saharan
              Africa to address the growing orphan crisis, yet there is a lack
              of information on these models available in the literature. We
              applied a human rights framework using the United Nations
              Convention on the Rights of the Child to understand what extent
              children's basic human rights were being upheld in institutional
              vs. community- or family-based care settings in Uasin Gishu
              County, Kenya. METHODS: The Orphaned and Separated Children's
              Assessments Related to their Health and Well-Being Project is a
              5-year cohort of orphaned children and adolescents aged </=18
              year. This descriptive analysis was restricted to baseline data.
              Chi-Square test was used to test for associations between
              categorical /dichotomous variables. Fisher's exact test was also
              used if some cells had expected value of less than 5. RESULTS:
              Included in this analysis are data from 300 households, 19
              Charitable Children's Institutions (CCIs) and 7 community-based
              organizations. In total, 2871 children were enrolled and had
              baseline assessments done: 1390 in CCI's and 1481 living in
              households in the community. We identified and described four
              broad models of care for orphaned and separated children,
              including: institutional care (sub-classified as 'Pure CCI' for
              those only providing residential care, 'CCI-Plus' for those
              providing both residential care and community-based supports to
              orphaned children , and 'CCI-Shelter' which are rescue,
              detention, or other short-term residential support), family-based
              care, community-based care and self-care. Children in
              institutional care (95\%) were significantly (p < 0.0001) more
              likely to have their basic material needs met in comparison to
              those in family-based care (17\%) and institutions were better
              able to provide an adequate standard of living. CONCLUSIONS: Each
              model of care we identified has strengths and weaknesses. The
              orphan crisis in sub-Saharan Africa requires a diversity of care
              environments in order to meet the needs of children and uphold
              their rights. Family-based care plays an essential role; however,
              households require increased support to adequately care for
              children.",

  abstract = "Large multigenerational cohort studies offer powerful ways to
              study the hereditary effects on various health outcomes. However,
              accounting for complex kinship relations in big data structures
              can be methodologically challenging. The traditional kinship
              model is computationally infeasible when considering thousands of
              individuals. In this article, we propose a computationally
              efficient alternative that employs fractional relatedness of
              family members through a series of founding members. The primary
              goal of this study is to investigate whether the effect of
              determinants on health outcome variables differs with and without
              accounting for family structure. We compare a fixed-effects model
              without familial effects with several variance components models
              that account for heritability and shared environment structure.
              Our secondary goal is to apply the fractional relatedness model
              in a realistic setting. Lifelines is a three-generation cohort
              study investigating the biological, behavioral, and environmental
              determinants of healthy aging. We analyzed a sample of 89,353
              participants from 32,452 reconstructed families. Our primary
              conclusion is that the effect of determinants on health outcome
              variables does not differ with and without accounting for family
              structure. However, accounting for family structure through
              fractional relatedness allows for estimating heritability in a
              computationally efficient way, showing some interesting
              differences between physical and mental quality of life
              heritability. We have shown through simulations that the proposed
              fractional relatedness model performs better than the standard
              kinship model, not only in terms of computational time and
              convenience of fitting using standard functions in R, but also in
              terms of bias of heritability estimates and coverage.",

              varied in two-parent biological, lone-parent, and step-families
              and whether this had a different contribution to the emotional
              and behavioral adjustment of adolescents across different family
              structures. The study is based on a sample of 1,515 secondary
              school students (ages 11-16 years) from England and Wales who
              completed a structured questionnaire. Findings of hierarchical
              regression analyses showed that among the whole sample, greater
              grandparent involvement was associated with fewer emotional
              problems (p < .01) and with more prosocial behavior (p < .001).
              In addition, while there were no differences in the level of
              grandparent involvement across the different family structures,
              grandparent involvement was more strongly associated with reduced

              by their children on the basis of a large survey done in France
              where both the elderly and their middle-aged children were
              interviewed. These data allow us to address such questions as:
              ``Who helps?'', ``Who receives help?'' and ``According to what
              principles?''. Besides the principle of need which is at work,
              the results show that there is also the principle of equity,
              which functions through reciprocity. This study highlights two
              main processes in the dynamics of support for the elderly, its
              redistributive effects (family support mainly benefits the
              poorest elderly), and its complementarity with the state health
              care systems (family support is mainly directed towards those who
              also receive public help). Can we make the deduction that the
              more generous the welfare state, the more developed family
              solidarity is? Nevertheless, some difficulties arise: support is
              mostly given by women. Furthermore there are a small number of
              people on whose shoulders it falls to take care of everybody else
              in the family. One sign of these difficulties is that the carers
              are more often in less good health than the non-carers of the
              same age. Comparisons from one generation to the other, including
              the youngest (the children of the middle generation who were also
              interviewed) shows that the younger generation will not want to
              be so completely involved in parental care at the expense of
              their own private time and life. Most probably family involvement

              Senegal, as in many other places, older, experienced women play
              an influential role in household maternal and child health (MCH)
              matters. Formative research in Serer villages revealed their
              importance and this was taken into account in an action research
              nutrition education (NE) project in which grandmothers were
              encouraged to promote improved nutritional practices related to
              pregnancy (e.g. decreased work;and improved diet) and infant
              feeding (e.g. breastfeeding and complementary feeding). A
              participatory communication/empowerment education approach was
              used involving songs, stories and group discussion. Quantitative
              and qualitative data were collected to both document and evaluate
              the intervention. Triangulation of the evaluation data suggests
              that 12 months after the intervention was initiated there were
              significant improvements in grandmothers' nutritional knowledge,
              in their advice to WRA, and in the nutrition-related practices of
              these younger women associated both with pregnancy and infant
              feeding. For example, in the pre-test only 20\% of grandmothers
              stated that they advise pregnant women to decrease their workload
              whereas in the post-test 87\% reported giving this advice. At the
              same time, 91\% of WRA in villages with the grandmother strategy
              reported having decreased their workload during their last
              pregnancy whereas in villages with NE activities for WRA but not
              with grandmothers, only 34\% of younger women reported having
              done so. These findings provide evidence of grandmothers' ability
              to learn, to integrate new information into their practices and
              to positively influence the practices of WRA. These results
              support the need for future MCH programs, in different cultural
              contexts, to involve grandmothers and in so doing to build on
              their intrinsic commitment to family well-being. (C) 2003

              coparenting grandmothers helping their adult sons or daughters to
              raise their grandchildren. Results. Contrary to expectation,
              triangulation involving a weak parent-grandmother relationship
              was not related to significantly lower grandmother well-being. In
              contrast, the emotionally isolated parent, particularly common in
              custodial families, was related to lower grandmother well-being,
              whether or not the parent lived in the household. The
              configuration in which the parent provided a link for both other

  author   = "Awad, A G and Voruganti, L N",
  abstract = "Schizophrenia is a disabling, chronic psychiatric disorder that
              poses numerous challenges in its management and consequences. It
              extols a significant cost to the patient in terms of personal
              suffering, on the caregiver as a result of the shift of burden of
              care from hospital to families, and on society at large in terms
              of significant direct and indirect costs that include frequent
              hospitalizations and the need for long-term psychosocial and
              economic support, as well as life-time lost productivity. 'Burden
              of care' is a complex construct that challenges simple
              definition, and is frequently criticized for being broad and
              generally negative. Frequently, burden of care is more defined by
              its impacts and consequences on caregivers. In addition to the
              emotional, psychological, physical and economic impact, the
              concept of 'burden of care' involves subtle but distressing
              notions such as shame, embarrassment, feelings of guilt and
              self-blame. The early conceptualization of 'burden of care' into
              two distinct components (objective and subjective) has guided
              research efforts until the present time. Objective burden of care
              is meant to indicate its effects on the household such as taking
              care of daily tasks, whereas subjective burden indicates the
              extent to which the caregivers perceive the burden of care.
              Research contributions in later years (1980s to the present) have
              added more depth to understanding of the construct of burden of
              care by exploring important determinants and factors that likely
              contribute or mediate the caregiver's perception of burden of
              care. Several studies examined the role of gender, and reported
              that relatives of male patients with schizophrenia frequently
              experience more social dysfunction and disabilities than those of
              female patients. Similarly, a number of other studies documented
              the contribution of ethnicity and cultural issues to subjective
              burden of care. Although there is no complete agreement on
              whether a specific cluster of psychotic symptoms has the most
              impact on a caregiver's burden of care, there is agreement that
              the severity of symptoms increases it. An extensive literature
              concerning family interventions in schizophrenia has demonstrated
              the positive impact of various family interventions in improving
              family environment, reducing relapse and easing the burden of
              care. Although the evidence of such positive impact of family
              interventions in schizophrenia is well documented, such
              interventions are neither widely used nor appropriately
              integrated in care plans, and are frequently underfunded.
              Although the cost of caregiving is considered to be significant,
              there are no reliable estimates of the costs associated with such
              care. The majority of available literature categorized the cost
              of burden of care among the indirect costs of schizophrenia in
              general. In recent years, attempts to compare the costs of
              caregiving in several countries have been reported in the
              evolving literature on this topic. 'Burden of care' as a complex
              construct certainly requires the development of appropriate
              methodology for its costing. In achieving a balance between the
              patients' and caregivers' perspectives, caregivers have to be
              included in the care plan and adequate information and support
              extended to the family and caregivers. Access to better treatment
              for patients, including medications, psychosocial interventions
              and rehabilitation services, are important basic elements in
              easing the burden on caregivers. Other measures such as
              availability of crisis management, provision of legally mandated
              community treatment to avert hospitalization, and well informed
              and balanced advocacy are also important. Although research
              efforts have been expanded in the last 3 decades, an urgent need
              exists for enhancing such efforts, particularly in the
              development and evaluation of effective family interventions
              strategies. There is also a need for continued improvement in the
              delivery of psychiatric services to the severely psychiatrically
              ill and their families. As there is a lack of reliable cost
              information about the family burden of care specific to
              schizophrenia, there is an urgent need to develop reliable
              approaches that can generate data that can inform in policy
              making and organization of services.",

              deal with the total social network surrounding a seriously
              dysfunctional family. They describe how this approach adapts
              itself well to a rural setting and seems to encompass most if not
              all of the significant helping systems in the family social
              sphere. The roles of the various team members are carefully
              outlined and the process of the therapeutic meeting is described.
              The authors believe that this approach has a facilitative effect
              to increase the functionality of already existing natural social
              systems on which the families are already quite dependent, but
              which prior to the network sessions were largely nonfunctional.
              The effect of all of this is to reduce drastically the amount of
              wasted time, energy, and effort that occurs when all the

              of elderly migrants who are in constant movement between social
              contexts, families, and states. Drawing on a case of Bulgarian
              Muslim migrants in Spain, I look into the ruptures in the
              structure of care arrangements, kin expectations, and family
              relations, which migration triggers. I suggest that these
              transformations, albeit subtle, lead to reformulation of the
              fabric of the family. In this way, transnational care-motivated
              mobility affects future security based on kin reciprocity. At the
              same time, migration disrupts aging careers' social citizenship
              both in Bulgaria and in Spain by limiting or even excluding them
              from state welfare support. I argue that these two lines of
              transformation, kinship and citizenship, result in new forms of
              gender and intergenerational inequalities. Furthermore, their
              intersection leads to a move from welfare to kinfare, which not
              only affects present arrangements between migrants, but also
              entails future insecurities.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore the family
              roles and psychological well-being of grandparents who are
              caregivers of grandchildren with autism spectrum disorders.
              METHOD: The study used quantitative methods with a correlational
              design. A self-administered questionnaire was used as an
              instrument to measure the variables of psychological wellbeing
              and the grandparenting role. This research involved 108
              grandparents from Semarang, Jepara and Kendal, obtained through a
              quota-purposive sampling technique. Quantitative data analysis
              was based on simple regression analysis. RESULTS: The study
              results showed rxy= 0.397; P = .000 (P < .05), which indicates a
              positive and significant correlation between the role played by
              grandparents and their psychological well-being. CONCLUSIONS: The
              test results indicate a significant correlation between the roles
              of grandparents and their psychological well-being. The greater
              the role played by grandparents, the higher psychological
              well-being they experienced, and vice versa. Grandparents play an
              important role in families where there is a child with autism;
              they take care of the child when the parents are not at home,
              help with the cost of therapy, and take care of them when sick.",

@ARTICLE{Campbell1973-hn,

  author   = "Campbell, A A",
  abstract = "The 1906-1910 cohort of women in the United States had a
              completed fertility average of 2.3 children, a net reproduction
              rate 13\% below replacement level. 44\% of these women had no
              children or only 1. This low fertility is not attributed to
              effects of the Depression. Lowering in fertility began in the
              1920's and among the better educated classes of the population.
              The reduction in fertility was achieved with ineffective methods
              of birth control and, it is believed, widespread use of illegal
              abortion. The 1931-1935 cohorts had a completed family size of
              3.2 children, the highest fertility level since the 1881-1885
              cohorts. This high fertility is due largely to 2-4 children
              families. Fertility rose most among college educated women, and
              among middle- and upper class women. Reasons for the sharp
              increase in fertility is the small numbers of young people
              entering the job market at that time and the preponderance of
              early childbearing. It is predicted that fertility of the
              1956-1960 cohort will be lower than that of the 1931-1935 cohort.
              It will probably not reach the low levels of the 1906-1910 cohort
              because there is a widespread desire for at least 1 child. The
              rate for 3rd and higher birth orders is falling to its lowest
              level ever. To achieve population replacement level in the United
              States, effective contraception and liberal provision for
              abortion are necessary. Social changes which emphasize the small
              family norm are also necessary. eng",

              roughly outline how the concept has been used during the past 30
              years to describe the nature and quality of the adult
              child-parent relationship. The concept is analysed in more
              detail. We argue that filial maturity can be placed in a
              developmental psychological perspective. This means that it has
              to be conceived as a specific maturity in the filial role and
              that some arguments can be given to explain the developmental
              psychological character of the concept. In view of the
              theoretical and clinical applicability of the construct we prefer
              to consider filial maturity as a non-age-graded developmental
              task within the context of filial care of adult children for
              their aged parents. Within this context of parent care we propose
              a (new) definition of the concept and differentiate it from other
              related constructs. Our definition highlights three important
              dimensions which refer to the way the adult children engage in
              the relationship with their parents: (a) they behave in an
              empathetic and responsive way in the intergenerational
              relationship, without role-reversal, (b) they take care of their
              aged parents without loosing their own autonomy, and (c) they
              respect their parents in their autonomy and enduring parental
              role.",

              (REPRINTS)'' in which senior volunteers engage in reading picture
              books to children. The ``REPRINTS'' program consistently involves
              social roles and intellectual activity, two higher-level
              functional capacities. This study reported findings and problems
              experienced through ``REPRINTS'' during the first year,
              ascertained potential effectiveness of social activity, and
              proposed methods for continued activity. METHODS: Basic concepts
              of ``REPRINTS''program include ``contribution to society'',
              ``life-long learning'', and ``group activity.'' Sixty seven
              volunteers and 74 controls, all aged 60 years and over living in
              three areas, ie., Chuo-ku, central Tokyo, Kawasaki city, suburb
              of Tokyo and Nagahama city, a local city, participated in a
              baseline health check-up in June, 2004. After completion of
              3-month training seminars (once a week, 2 hr per session),
              volunteers visited public elementary schools and kindergartens in
              groups of 6-10 persons for 6 months. They were assessed again by
              follow-up health check-up in March, 2005. RESULTS: At baseline,
              the proportion of those who had no grand children (41.8\% vs.
              20.3\%, P= 0.006), average school years (13.4 +/- 2.5 vs. 12.3
              +/- 2.5 years, P= 0.008), having any experience of volunteer
              activities (79.1\% vs. 52.7\%, P=0.001), and an usual walking
              speed (86.7 +/- 12.3 vs. 81.3 +/- 12.9 m/min, P=0.012) were
              significantly higher in volunteers than in controls. There was no
              significant difference in other baseline characteristics between
              the two groups. At follow-up, social network scores for 56
              volunteers were significantly improved: frequency of contact with
              grandchildren and others around neighborhood and size of circles
              of friends and acquaintances were increased, as compared to
              controls. Social support scores for the volunteers significantly
              decreased in the receiving aspect, while increased in the giving
              aspect. In addition, consciousness of loving community and
              self-rated health were significantly enhanced and hand-grip
              strength showed significantly less decline in volunteers than in
              controls. CONCLUSIONS: Through engaging in the intergenerational
              and intellectual volunteer programs for 9 months, subjective
              health, social support and network, consciousness of loving
              community and some aspects of physical performance were
              significantly promoted in senior volunteers. Coordination of
              existing administrative services enabled us to establish this

              of urban populations in Norway, England, Germany, Spain and
              Israel. Support for filial norms has a north-south dimension in
              Europe, and is highest in Spain and Israel and lowest - but still
              substantial - in Norway, England and Germany. National
              differences in preferences and policy opinions are more
              substantial, and more or less congruent with national family and
              social policy traditions. Filial solidarity is, however, not
              incompatible with generous welfare state arrangements, nor do
              filial obligations necessarily imply that the family is seen as
              the 'natural' care provider. In fact, many in the countries with
              the highest scores for filial responsibility still find the
              welfare state to be the main source of care provision. Normative
              familism is correlated with expressed familism in individuals'
              preferences and in policy opinions, but the correlations are
              weak, implying that while filial solidarity may be resilient, as

              children and older adults, and older adults' psychosocial

              grandparent marijuana use (current and prior) predicts an
              increased likelihood of child cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana
              use. METHODS: Using multilevel modeling of prospective data
              spanning three generations (n = 306 families, children ages
              6-22), this study tested associations between grandparent (G1)
              and parent (G2) marijuana use and child (G3) past-year cigarette,
              alcohol, and marijuana use. Analyses tested whether G3
              substance-related norms mediated these associations. Current G1
              and G2 marijuana use was examined, as was G2 high school and
              early adult use and G1 marijuana use when G2 parents were in
              early adolescence. Controls included G2 age at G3 birth, G2
              education and depression, and G3 gender. RESULTS: G2 current
              marijuana use predicted a higher likelihood of G3 alcohol and
              marijuana use but was not related to the probability of G3
              cigarette use. G3's perceptions of their parents' norms and G2
              current marijuana use both contributed independently to the
              likelihood of G3 alcohol and marijuana use when included in the
              same model. G3 children's own norms and their perceptions of
              friends' norms mediated the link between G2 current marijuana use
              and G3 alcohol and marijuana use. CONCLUSIONS: Results are
              discussed in light of the growing trend toward marijuana
              legalization. To the extent that parent marijuana use increases
              under legalization, we can expect more youth to use alcohol and
              marijuana and to have norms that favor substance use.",

              chances, with implications for cycles of advantage or

              influence offspring cognitive development, but the extent to
              which these mediate intergenerational continuities and
              discontinuities in cognitive ability has not been adequately
              studied. METHODS: We used factor analysis to derive summary
              measures of parenting practices, and regression analyses and path
              modelling to test associations between these and cognitive
              function at age 8 years in 1690 first offspring of the British
              1946 birth cohort. Analyses allowed for direct and indirect
              effects of parental original and achieved social circumstances,
              educational attainment and own childhood cognitive ability.
              Additional covariates were provided by indicators of parental
              physical and mental health. RESULTS: Regression analyses revealed
              that three aspects of parenting, intellectual home environment,
              parental aspiration and cognitive stimulation, were positively
              and independently associated with offspring childhood cognitive
              ability, whereas coercive discipline was negatively and
              independently associated. Path modelling was appropriate for
              intellectual environment, which also revealed direct and indirect
              effects of parental cognitive ability and educational and
              occupational attainment on offspring cognitive ability.
              CONCLUSION: Parenting practices, particularly provision of an
              intellectual environment, were directly associated with offspring
              cognitive development. These data add to the relatively few

              during adolescence presents a major public health burden.
              Research from high-income countries indicates that evidence-based
              parenting program interventions can reduce child maltreatment.
              Much less is known, however, about how beneficiaries of these
              programs experience this process of change. Understanding the
              process that brings about change in child maltreatment practices
              is essential to understanding intervention mechanisms of change.
              This is particularly important given the current scale-up of
              parenting programs across low- and middle-income countries.
              OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to provide insight into how
              caregivers and adolescents attending a parenting program in South
              Africa perceived changes associated with abuse reduction.
              METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with
              caregivers and adolescents (n = 42) after the intervention, as
              well as observations of sessions (n = 9) and focus group
              discussions (n = 240 people). Participants were adolescents
              between the ages of 10-18 and their primary caregiver residing in
              peri-urban and rural program clusters in the Eastern Cape
              Province of South Africa. Data were coded in Atlas.ti, and
              thematic content analysis was conducted. FINDINGS: Based on
              participant perceptions, the Sinovuyo Teen parenting program
              workshops catalyzed change into practice by creating an
              environment that was conducive to learning alternatives. It did
              so through prioritizing a process of mutual respect, openness,
              and being valued by others, giving legitimacy to a respectful
              reciprocity and new ways of spending time together that enabled
              caregivers and teenagers to shift and normalize more positive
              behaviors. This in turn led to reductions in physical and verbal
              abuse. CONCLUSIONS: This study's findings may be of use to
              policymakers and practitioners who need to understand how
              parenting programs support parents and teenagers in increasing
              positive parenting approaches and changing potentially harmful
              practices. It additionally highlights the importance of assessing
              the experiences of both parents and teenagers attending such

              preschool-age children declined significantly between 1977 and

              Thus, by 1994, employed Black mothers who most needed relatives'

              raising grandchildren who are living in rental housing and
              explored the sociodemographic characteristics and challenges
              faced by such renters. DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were obtained
              from the Census 2000 Supplementary Survey, a nationally
              representative survey of 700,000 households with a response rate
              of 96.8\%. Frequencies and bivariate analyses were focused on the
              2,639 respondents who were grandparent caregiver renters.
              RESULTS: Of the 2,350,000 grandparent caregivers in the United
              States in 2000, 26\% were renters, almost one third of whom were
              spending 30\% or more of their income on rent. For the quarter of
              a million grandparent caregiver renters living below the poverty
              line, 60\% were spending at least 30\% of their household income
              on rent and 3 of 10 were living in overcrowded conditions.
              IMPLICATIONS: Grandparent caregivers who are renters represent a
              particularly vulnerable population. The need for further
              research, policy, and programs for this group is discussed.",

              Community Survey/Census 2000 Supplementary Survey. In 2000 there
              were estimated to be nearly 53,000 AI/AN grandparent caregivers
              age 45 and older in the United States. Almost half of the
              caregiving grandparents had been raising a grandchild for five
              years or longer. The findings reveal a portrait of grandparents
              committed to raising their grandchildren despite the fact that
              many were living in extreme poverty, with ill health, and with
              limited resources and services. One-third of grandparent
              caregivers were living below the poverty line, and only
              one-quarter of these were receiving public assistance. Even when
              compared with their noncaregiving AI/AN peers, grandparents
              raising grandchildren were disproportionately female, poor,
              living with a functional disability, and living in overcrowded
              conditions. Implications for social work practice are presented

              may result in a loss of parenting. The adjustment process to any

              on family obligation a set of responsibilities, duties, and
              obligation of care and assistance,that adult children should
              assume when parents are old or infirm. This concept is limited,
              because it assumes that family obligation is salient only in one
              period of life: when parents reach old age and are infirm. In
              contrast, a relational approach to family obligation considers
              family relationships as central to understanding children's
              duties and responsibilities. Following Stein, family obligation
              can be defined as felt obligation: expectations for appropriate
              and negotiated behaviour, perceived within the context of
              specific personal relationships with kin across life course. Felt
              obligation is conceptualized in five dimensions: a duty to
              maintain contact, assistance, avoidance of conflict, personal
              sharing, and self-sufficiency. The purpose of the present study
              was to analyze perceptions of felt obligation in
              intergenerational relationships (parent-child and family of
              origin) in different phases of the family life cycle in a
              specific cultural context (Italy). The sample was composed of 92
              parents with children of different ages (infants, school-aged
              children, and young adults).The measure addressed the five
              dimensions of felt obligation, all assessed in various phases of
              family life. Results indicated differences in dimensions of felt
              obligation between intergenerational relationships (both
              parent-child and with family of origin). Some of these
              differences, such as self-sufficiency and personal sharing,
              assumed more importance and salience in some periods of the life
              cycle than in others.",

              less certain genetic relatedness with the children and

              investment (Laham, Gonsalkorale, and von Hippel, 2005) predicts
              investment to vary according to available investment options. Two
              previous studies have tested this hypothesis with small samples

              grandchildren, followed by maternal grandfathers, paternal
              grandmothers and last by paternal grandfathers; 2) maternal
              grandfathers and paternal grandmothers provide equal amounts of
              care when the latter do not have grandchildren via a daughter; 3)
              women who have grandchildren via both a daughter and a son will
              look after the children of the daughter more; and 4) men who have
              grandchildren via both a daughter and a son will look after the

              mother's chance of being married and whether it increases her
              chance of living in an extended family. Using two different
              measures of child health, we find that having an unhealthy child
              decreases the mother's likelihood of being married. Our results
              imply that children in poor health are more likely to face
              obstacles beyond their illness because they also are more likely
              to suffer the consequences of poverty and the poor schooling
              outcomes that result from being raised in a female-headed
              household. The only mitigating factor is that unhealthy white
              children are more likely than their healthy counterparts to be
              living in an extended family.",

  abstract = "Focus group discussions and interviews were held with 40 orphans,
              25 caretakers and 33 other community workers from a rural area
              near Mutare, Zimbabwe. Orphan concerns included feeling different
              from other children, stress, stigmatization, exploitation,
              schooling, lack of visits and neglect of support responsibilities
              by relatives. Many community members, while recognizing their
              limitations due to poverty, were already actively helping orphans
              and caretakers. Extended family networks are the primary resource
              for orphans, though some relatives exploit orphans or fail to
              fulfil their responsibilities. Interventions are suggested which
              support community coping mechanisms by strengthening the
              capacities of families to care for orphans. Outside organizations
              can develop partnerships with community groups, helping them to
              respond to the impact of AIDS, by building upon existing concern
              for orphan families. They can help affected communities to
              develop orphan support activities which encourage caring
              responses by community leaders and relatives and which discourage
              property-grabbing and orphan neglect. Material support channelled
              through community groups to destitute families at critical times
              can strengthen family coping mechanisms. Income-generating
              activities should build upon communities' existing capabilities
              and benefit the most vulnerable orphan households. Some
              communities are responding to the AIDS disaster by adaptations to
              cope with devastating changes taking place in their communities.
              Interviews and focus group discussions involving 40 orphans, 25
              caretakers, and 33 community workers from a rural area near
              Mutare, Zimbabwe, explored community responses to children
              orphaned as a result of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
              (AIDS) pandemic and other factors. Mutare is the site of a
              church-based orphan support program that provides home visits,
              material assistance, and counseling to orphan households. A 1995
              enumeration in Mutare revealed 14.7\% of children were orphaned.
              The extended family remains the principle orphan-care unit,
              although some relatives exploit the children's labor and fail to
              meet their educational and medical needs. Only 5 orphans felt
              there were no differences between themselves and non-orphaned
              children. Orphans reported they were forced to work rather than
              attend school, isolated from peers, neglected or maltreated by
              caretakers, and stigmatized. Stigmatization was more likely to be
              based on orphan status or poverty than AIDS as the cause of a
              parent's death. Despite the area's substantial poverty, many
              families with orphans had received assistance from community
              members and local churches. The orphan visiting program has
              promoted a generally humane attitude toward these children.
              Traditional community leaders and community visitors can exercise
              moral influence by encouraging relatives to fulfill their family
              responsibilities, protecting the inheritance rights of orphans
              and widows, and helping vulnerable families retain and use their
              land. Outside organizations can channel direct material support
              (e.g., food relief, medical costs, and school fees) through
              community groups to enhance the coping capabilities of destitute
              families and assist communities in developing income-generating

  abstract = "This study explores the hypothesis that the mother's position
              within household power relations--her autonomy with respect to
              other household members--influences her ability to provide for
              the health of her children. We argue that in the context of the
              Arab Middle East, a woman's structural position within the
              household is a good indicator of her relative autonomy: if she is
              the daughter-in-law in a vertically extended residential unit,
              she has less autonomy than if she is head or co-head of
              household. Our analysis is based on data collected from 1341
              households in 1985 as a part of the Follow-up Health and
              Population Assessment of four urban settlements in Amman, Jordan.
              They include measures of the child's weight and age, plus a
              variety of socioeconomic factors. We analyze the effect of the
              mother's autonomy on child nutritional status within a multiple
              regression framework that controls for rival hypotheses. In
              particular, we investigate whether it is the availability of
              other potential child-care substitutes, particularly the
              grandmother, that influences child nutrition rather than
              household structure. We also look at household income, mother's
              education, the area of residence, and the child's sex. Our
              results show a strong negative influence associated with having a
              mother whose autonomy in the household is low. This effect does
              not disappear when mother's age and education, and household size
              and composition are taken into consideration. Nor is it a proxy
              for the higher household incomes characteristic of
              extended-family residential units with their multiple earners.",

              exchange of financial aid and household care between elderly
              people and their family members. The respondents were 213 people
              who had family members living in Hong Kong aged 70-years-old or
              older from a longitudinal study of a representative community
              sample of the elderly population in Hong Kong. Using multiple

  abstract = "PURPOSE: The Family Support Agreement (FSA) is a voluntary but
              legal contract between older parents and adult children on
              parental support in China. As the first comprehensive empirical
              study on the FSA, this study aims to understand the prevalence
              and covariates of older parents' perceived need and actual use of
              this agreement. DESIGN AND METHODS: Using logistic regression
              analyses, t-tests and chi-square tests, this study analyzed data
              from a nationally representative sample of 9,587 rural parents
              aged 60 years and above from the 2006 Sample Survey on Aged
              Population in Urban/Rural China, which had a 99\% response rate.
              RESULTS: More than 11\% of the subjects regarded the FSA as
              necessary, and more than 6\% have signed it, respectively,
              representing 160 million and 30.7 million older Chinese.
              Perceiving the need for the FSA was associated with living
              arrangement, number of daughters-in-law, care needs, filial piety
              assessment and concerns, family harmony, sociodemographics,
              individual characteristics related to rights protection, and the
              existence of rights protection-related local community
              organizations. Having signed the FSA was associated with the
              above last 3 factors, traditional old-age support strategy, and
              FSA need assessment. IMPLICATIONS: Individuals regarding the FSA
              as necessary or using it are characterized by personal, familial,
              and sociocultural factors that render them more in need of
              parental support but less likely to receive it. They are also
              better informed about their rights, are more willing to take
              actions to protect their rights, and have more exposure to rights

               of actual therapeutic dialogue, by two collaborating
               practitioners, reveals how opportunities are identified, how
               options for solution-focused responding are generated, how the

               rationales for the particular selection may be usefully shared
               and compared. The most practical application for this study of
               opportunities lies in the continual refinement of

              in the sixth wave of the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) on
              childhood family structure. After comparing such data with a
              large number of studies by using external sources, we find that
              the BHPS data overestimate the proportion of people who report an
              experience of life in a non-intact family during childhood by
              about 10\%. Although an explanation based on recall error that
              deteriorates with the age of the BHPS respondents is possible,
              the overestimation is likely to be accounted for by non-ignorable
              attrition that may affect most of the comparison studies based on
              longitudinal data. Conversely, comparisons with other independent
              measurements from the BHPS itself reveal that the wave 6 data
              underestimate the proportion of young people who have lived at
              least part of their childhood in a non-intact family by about
              8\%. The probability of disagreement between these two sets of
              measures is strongly associated with poor interview
              characteristics, which may affect the comparison measure more
              than the wave 6 measure. Despite such differences, there is
              therefore a substantial degree of similarity between the family
              structure information that was collected in the sixth wave of the

  author   = "Bodner, E and Cohen-Fridel, S and Yaretzky, A",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have found correlations between
              negative perceptions of old age and perceived quality of life
              (QoL) among elderly people. It has also been suggested that a
              denial of aging mechanism is employed and might support ageist
              attitudes among private-sheltered housing tenants compared with
              elderly people who live in the community and experience
              intra-generational interactions. Therefore, we hypothesized that
              tenants of sheltered housing will report more ageist attitudes
              towards people of their own age, and report a lower QoL than
              elderly people who live in the community. METHODS: The sample
              included 126 volunteers, aged between 64 and 94 years, who live
              in private-sheltered housing (n = 32) or in the community (n =
              94). The participants completed the Fraboni scale of ageism, and
              a QoL Inventory (SF-36). RESULTS: People, and men in particular,
              who live in sheltered housing, reported more intergenerational
              ageist attitudes than men and women who live in the community.
              Tenants in sheltered housing expressed lower evaluations of their
              mental health, but higher evaluations on ``social functioning''
              (QoL scales). Women from sheltered housing reported better mental
              health than men. Gender and some QoL scales were associated with
              higher ageism. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in ageist attitudes
              between both dwelling places can be interpreted according to
              Social Identity Theory, which refers to the impact of the ingroup
              on social attitudes. Differences in QoL can be understood by the
              accessibility of social activities in private-sheltered housing.
              Gender differences in ageism and QoL can be explained by women's
              better social adjustment. Findings should be regarded with
              caution because of the small sample.",

              percentage of women with HIV in the U.S. and experience worse
              health outcomes than other women living with HIV, in part due to
              experiences of trauma, racism, HIV-stigma, and stressors they
              face as women. However, their own stories of resilience in the
              face of multiple adversities and insights of community
              stakeholders may inform our field on how to best empower this
              population to strive despite adversities. Thirty BWLWH in the
              U.S. and fifteen community stakeholders were interviewed about
              women's experiences and adaptive coping strategies used to cope
              with trauma, racism, HIV-stigma, and gender-related stressors.
              Interviews were coded using thematic content analysis. A major
              theme that spanned across interviews with BWLWH and community
              stakeholders was that resilience was fostered by members of their
              ``village''. In the midst of or following adverse experiences
              BWLWH used social support from their children, grandchildren,
              other family members, friends/peers, and caring providers in
              order to overcome their adversities and focus on their health and
              well-being. Promoting resilience among BWLWH requires an
              understanding of the most adaptive strategies utilized to
              ``bounce back'' following or in the face of adversities. Our
              findings highlight that both BWLWH and community stakeholders
              recognize social support from their ``village'' as an importance
              resilience resource. Research and applied efforts need to be
              geared at strengthening both BWLWH and their ``village'' in order

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Pneumonia and influenza (P\&I) is a major cause of
              morbidity and mortality in the USA, particularly in elderly
              people. Recent research indicates that P\&I may be linked to
              socioeconomic conditions associated with interactions of children
              with vulnerable elderly people that may proliferate the spread of
              disease. This study assessed the associations between four
              sociodemographic characteristics--median county income, Gini
              index, youth dependency ratio and proportion of co-residential
              caregiver grandparents--and P\&I on the county level overall and
              by age group. METHODS: All hospitalisations due to P\&I from 1991
              to 2004 were abstracted from the Centers for Medicare and
              Medicaid Services database and categorised by influenza year
              (July-June) and age category. Using generalised estimating
              equations, associations between P\&I rates and four
              sociodemographic variables were assessed and models were
              stratified by income to assess income as a potential effect
              modifier. RESULTS: P\&I rates were higher in counties with lower
              median income. In low-income counties, high levels of live-in
              grandparental caregivers were associated with consistently higher
              levels of pneumonia and influenza rates. The Gini index was
              positively associated with disease rates, particularly in younger
              age groups. DISCUSSION: These results suggest complex
              relationships between sociodemographic characteristics and P\&I
              outcomes for elderly people, particularly those related to
              children. The strength of the relationship between the proportion
              of grandparental caregivers and disease rates decreases with age,
              which may caregiving patterns, or may serve as a proxy for
              related sociodemographic characteristics. These findings merit
              further research to understand better how area-level factors
              affect P\&I patterns in elderly people.",

              preferred option by most key planners and organizations, warnings
              of the limitations of this alternative have been increasing. This
              study assessed the views of 1400 adults (both current and
              prospective caregivers) regarding the placement of children. Most
              current caregivers believed that either their partner (30\%), a
              grandparent (25\%) or another family member (33\%) would look
              after the child/children if they were no longer able to. However,
              12\% of parents could not identify a carer or predicted only a
              bleak future for their children. There was strong willingness
              amongst adults of various relational proximity to take in
              children if required to -71\% of both fathers and grandparents,
              63\% of siblings and 23\% of best friends said they would take in
              children. Nonetheless this research suggests that the willingness
              may not necessarily be translated into reality. Most prospective
              caregivers identified significant additional stressors (most
              importantly financial) and expressed a strong need for assistance
              if they were to take in additional children. The HIV status of
              the child is also likely to sway placement decisions for some
              people. Nonetheless opportunities to keep children in families
              are clearly high, but people will need considerable help to
              realize this potential. For some children alternatives other than
              the extended family will be required.",

              reduced by the demands of unpaid family work and domestic chores
              and by the use of mother substitutes for childcare, especially in

              exit from the labor force for some years when their children are
              young; they also differ from nonemployed mothers in other uses of
              time (housework, volunteer work, leisure). In addition, changes

              positively influence the functional performance of elderly
              people. OBJECTIVE: To verify the association between the
              characteristics of social networks of the elderly people and the
              emergence of functional impairment. METHODS: This is a
              longitudinal population-based study, which used the 2006 (n =
              1,413) and 2010 (n = 990) cohorts of the Health, Well-Being, and
              Aging (SABE) Study. To characterize the social networks, the
              following variables were used: number of members in the network;
              living arrangements; sex and age of the members; coresidence with
              children or only elderly individuals; satisfaction with the
              relationships; and receiving and offering social support
              (financial, material, emotional, performing tasks inside and
              outside the home, providing companionship, and personal care).
              Logistic regression was used to analyze the data. All ethical
              guidelines were followed. RESULTS: The social networks of the
              elderly people had an average of 8.15 members and consisted
              predominantly of family members aged between 15 and 59 years.
              Dependent elderly people received more material support, help in
              performing household tasks and those outside the home, and
              personal care, while the independent elderly people received more
              emotional support and companionship. Provision of social support
              (OR = 0.32, 95\%CI 0.14 - 0.71) decreased the chances of
              developing dependency, independent of sociodemographic and health
              conditions. CONCLUSION: The strengthening of social networks in
              old age should be encouraged since confidence in informal care
              offered, mainly by families, may not be the best option for
              dealing with the growing demand for care that accompanies the

              successful aging and life satisfaction and how these concepts can

              Foster Grandparent Program (ages 61-92) were randomly selected
              and interviewed using an open-ended survey questionnaire. These
              questions explored understandings of successful aging and life
              satisfaction, the factors essential for each, and the differences
              perceived between these concepts. Qualitative data were coded by
              two independent reviewers. Respondents' understandings of
              successful aging involved attitudinal or coping orientations
              nearly twice as often as those for life satisfaction.
              Descriptions of life satisfaction emphasized the fulfillment of
              basic needs and was viewed as a precursor to successful aging.
              Content analysis confirmed five features of successful aging:
              interactions with others, a sense of purpose, self-acceptance,
              personal growth, and autonomy. The findings suggest that

  abstract = "Background Stature is an important determinant of several
              reproductive and non-reproductive health problems. Documentation
              of secular trends in stature has been based primarily on
              cross-sectional studies of special populations, primarily of men.
              The objective of this study is to determine how growth and
              socio-economic status (SES) factors relate to stature changes
              among lineal female relatives, maternal grandmothers to mothers.
              Methods The study base was derived from a population-based
              intergenerational cohort which linked several statewide databases
              to data from the mothers' own birth certificates: the Washington
              State Intergenerational Cohort. Mothers in these ethnic groups
              were separately studied: non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans,
              Native Americans, Hispanics. We generated simple, partial, and
              multiple correlation coefficients to investigate the association
              between stature and other growth and SES factors. Results A
              mother's stature is determined partly by her own mother's stature
              and partly by her birthweight. These two measures are
              individually stronger predictors of stature than are several
              available SES factors considered in combination-grandmother's
              age, parity, marital status, and mother's age. The maximal
              multiple correlation models yielded R-2 values from 18\% to 28\%.
              Conclusions Growth measures are stronger predictors of
              intergenerational changes in stature than are the several
              available socio-economic factors. However, socio-economic factors
              are partly responsible for the level of achieved prenatal and
              postnatal growth. Since grandmother's stature is a determinant of
              mother's birthweight, which in turn is a determinant of infant
              birthweight, some environmentally influenced determinants of some
              birth outcomes are already established before a prospective
              mother is conceived or born.",

              vulnerable households during times of stress. In sub-Saharan
              Africa, extended families, together with communities, are the
              most effective responses enabling access to support for
              households facing crises. This paper reviews literature on
              informal social security systems in sub-Saharan Africa, analyses
              changes taking place in their functioning as a result of HIV/AIDS
              and describes community safety net components including economic
              associations, cooperatives, loan providers, philanthropic groups
              and HIV/AIDS initiatives. Community safety nets target households
              in greatest need, respond rapidly to crises, are cost efficient,
              based on local needs and available resources, involve the
              specialized knowledge of community members and provide financial
              and psycho-social support. Their main limitations are lack of
              material resources and reliance on unpaid labour of women.
              Changes have taken place in safety net mechanisms because of
              HIV/AIDS, suggesting the resilience of communities rather than
              their impending collapse. Studies are lacking that assess the
              value of informal community-level transfers, describe how safety
              nets assist the poor or analyse modifications in response to
              HIV/AIDS. The role of community safety nets remains largely
              invisible under the radar of governments, non-governmental
              organizations and international bodies. External support can
              strengthen this system of informal social security that provides

              growth (adequate versus failure to thrive [FTT]). METHODS:
              Seventy-nine adolescent mothers of infants and toddlers (42 with
              adequate growth and 37 with FTT) recruited from a primary care
              clinic. Data collected during a laboratory evaluation included a
              videotaped session of mother and child during feeding,
              developmental assessment (Bayley Scales), and questionnaires on
              family support, perceived parenting stress, and maternal
              perception of child's temperament. ANALYSIS: Multivariate
              analyses of covariance. Independent variables were growth
              (adequate/FTT) and grandmother co-residence (present/absent).
              Dependent variables were maternal warmth during feeding, maternal
              perception of child's temperament, child's mealtime behavior, and
              child's cognitive and motor development. Covariates were child's
              age, maternal age, maternal education, parity, family support,
              and perceived stress. RESULTS: Teen mothers living with
              grandmothers were younger (mean age = 17.4 versus 18.6, p = .03)
              and had fewer children (mean parity = 1.2 versus 1.7, p = .001).
              Mothers displayed more warmth when not living with grandmothers
              (p = .01). Among adequately growing children, grandmother
              co-residence was associated with better motor skills (106 versus

              co-residence was associated with lower motor skills (90 versus
              100, p = .017). CONCLUSIONS: Although multigenerational families
              may be protective for some teen parents and their young children,
              grandmother co-residence was not associated with maternal warmth.

              PARTICIPANTS: Volunteer, consecutive sample of parents of 124
              preadolescents with a variety of chronic conditions. METHODS:
              In-depth, in-home interviews conducted with parents. Quantitative
              data from the Social Support Assessment questionnaire was used to
              assess and compare sources and types of helpful support at
              baseline and 1 year later. Content analytic methods were used to
              categorize unsupportive behaviors described by parents during the
              first interview. RESULTS: Both mothers and fathers reported that
              other family members were the primary source of helpful emotional
              and tangible support, while health care providers were the
              primary source of helpful informational support. The amount of
              perceived support from family members, community members, and

              considerations relating to the physical and behavioral well-being
              of children raised by their grandparents. RECENT FINDINGS: As the
              number of children being raised by their grandparents in the
              United States steadily increases, the needs of these families
              require greater attention. These children and their custodial
              grandparents face unique health, social, legal, and financial
              challenges. Children being raised by their grandparents are at
              higher risk for developmental and behavioral problems because of
              prior or current adverse family environments. Moreover, there is
              evidence that custodial grandparents may experience negative
              health, social, and financial outcomes that may constrain their
              ability to provide the best care for their grandchildren.
              SUMMARY: Pediatricians should not only be aware of the medical
              and developmental status of children who are being reared by
              their grandparents, but also assess the needs, abilities, and
              potential limitations of these custodial grandparents. In
              addition to providing useful parenting advice and direct support
              to custodial grandparents, pediatricians should refer these
              families as needed to local grandparenting groups, social service

              grandchildren, although intensive grandparental childcare varies
              considerably across Europe. Few studies have explicitly
              investigated the extent to which such cross-national variations
              are associated with national level differences in individual
              demographic and socio-economic distributions along with
              contextual-structural and cultural factors (e.g., variations in
              female labor force participation, childcare provision, and
              cultural attitudes). METHODS: We used multilevel models to
              examine associations between intensive grandparental childcare
              and contextual-structural and cultural factors, after controlling
              for grandparent, parent, and child characteristics using
              nationally representative data from the Survey of Health, Ageing
              and Retirement in Europe. RESULTS: Even controlling for
              cross-national differences in demographic and socio-economic
              distributions, contextual-structural factors play an important
              role in explaining grandparental childcare variations in Europe.
              In particular, higher levels of intensive grandparental childcare
              are found in countries with low labor force participation among
              younger and older women, and low formal childcare provision,
              where mothers in paid work largely rely on grandparental support
              on an almost daily basis. DISCUSSION: Encouraging older women to
              remain in paid work is likely to have an impact on grandchild
              care which in turn may affect mothers' employment, particularly
              in Southern European countries where there is little formal
              childcare.",

               (1902?1987) was designed to promote openness, growth and change
               in understanding the counseling processes. It is an approach
               which is practical and helpful in education, because it can
               solve some of the problems outside the curriculum faced by
               students. For example it provides a way of understanding and
               solving issues of relationships, emotional development and
               ethical behaviour that seem to be at the root of most of the
               problems in school and society at large. However, it is
               essential to incorporate some accelerating ingredients to inform
               conditions which facilitate growth. These include acceptance,
               empathy and positive regard from others. For example it has been
               realized that if an individual is denied acceptance and positive
               regard they fail to relate the meaning of their experience to
               themselves and positive growth in such a relevant way is
               inhibited. However, the approach is faced with some drawbacks
               which will be explored. Teaching today in British schools is a
               very challenging job. It is becoming increasingly difficult to
               establish a classroom environment that is free from disruptive
               behaviour. The person-centred approach, where the student as the
               client is made responsible of his or her own behaviour, could be
               part of the solution. This could be the focus of an educational
               yet assertive discipline program. This paper will discuss the
               person-centred approach in counseling touching on the process of
               the helping relationship, empathy, congruence, unconditional
               positive regard as important concepts of the approach and some

              the predictors of this variability in human caregiving behavior
              has mostly focused on learning mechanisms. Evidence is currently
              accumulating for the complementary underlying role of steroid
              hormones and neuropeptides. An overview is provided of the
              hormones and neuropeptides relevant for human caregiving
              behavior. Then the developmental factors are described that
              stimulate variability in sensitivity to these hormones and
              neuropeptides, which may result in variability in the behavioral
              repertoire of caregiving. The role of genetic variation in
              neuropeptide and steroid receptors, the role of testosterone and
              oxytocin during fetal development and parturition, and the impact
              of experienced caregiving in childhood on functioning of the

              during a period of marked economic dislocation investigates
              whether supportive grandparents can ameliorate the negative
              effects of economic stress on parenting and on teen outcomes. The
              study focuses on harsh parenting and adolescent depression, which
              has been shown to be especially responsive to economic stress.
              Three hypotheses were investigated: (1) in extended families
              there is a link between economic adversity and adolescent
              depression that is mediated by harsh parenting; (2) grandparent
              support diminishes the relationship between economic pressure and
              harsh parenting; and (3) grandparent support diminishes the
              relationship between harsh parenting and adolescent depression.
              Data were collected from a community sample of 62 extended
              families with an adolescent during a period of marked economic
              dislocation in Bulgaria. Mothers, fathers, and adolescents
              completed questionnaires about perceived economic pressure,
              parents' harsh parenting, and perceived support of grandparents.
              Adolescents also completed a measure of self-reported depression.
              Additional interviews were conducted with every eligible family
              member about family relations. Results showed that even though
              there was significant economic stress reported by parents,
              adolescents reported moderate levels of depression and low levels
              of harsh parenting by mothers and fathers. Correlation and
              regression analyses revealed that whenever respondents
              experienced support by grandparents, it made a difference for
              family members. More specifically, despite economic stress,
              mothers who experienced the support of grandparents tended to
              exercise less harsh parenting practices than mothers who lacked
              such support. Furthermore, when grandparents were supportive,
              harsh parenting was not associated with adolescent depression.
              These findings are discussed in the light of existing studies of
              families under economic pressure with a special focus on extended
              family relations and the role of cultural context.",

               This relationship exists in individuals experiencing fall/winter
               seasonal affective disorder, premenstrual syndrome, and some
               obse individuals. The cravings and preference for these foods
               occur only during the fall and winter in indivuduals with
               seasonal affective disorder and in the luteal phase of the
               menstrual cycle in individuals with premenstrual disorder which
               is the time when symptoms of depression are experienced.
               Additionally, unipolar depressed individuals increase their
               preference for sweet carbohydrate/fat rich foods as they become
               depressed. They also increase their consumption of carbohydrates
               from sucrose. Several studies indicate that sweet
               carbohydrate/fat rich foods are consumed because of the
               resulting mood enhancement. However, other studies have revealed
               that elimination of intake of added sucrose and/or caffeine from
               the diet of unipolar depressed individuals results in an
               amelioration of depression that is maintained as long as the
               substance they are sensitive to, added sucrose or caffeine, is
               not consumed. The cravings and preference which some depressed
               individuals have for sweet carbohydrate/fat rich foods seems to
               result from the enhancement in mood following consumption.
               Paradoxically, however, a better long-term strategy for mood
               enhancement may be to totally eliminate added sucrose and

               foreign ones are marginalised. At present, Eastern and

               article, we challenge perceived cultural incommensurability by
               examining the socialisation of second-generation girls of

               tightly defined discursive range of linguistic resources to
               construct the meanings of sport, health and the body.
               Specifically, the girls refer to healthism, within which sport
               is seen to provide a means to achieve good health and a slim and
               feminine body. These references reflect a set of knowledge and
               discourses important to Western cultures. Alternative discursive
               resources exist, yet were not utilised. We argue that the girls'
               adoption of healthist ideas is used to counter cultural
               narratives?such as the uncultured, and thus non-integrated,

               is to redress the imbalance in psychology research and practice,

               conditions in schools which render them contexts replete with
               social messages about the body, health, and self. Research has
               suggested that both the formal and informal contexts of
               education are heavily imbued with a ?culture of healthism? which
               places moral obligation and blame on individuals for their

               schools. Data is presented from life history interviews with

               been diagnosed with anorexia or bulimia and perhaps others who

               relatively under explored in the sociology of education, between
               formal education and ?the middle class?. Our analyses point to
               the ways in which social trends outside schools relating to ?the

               performance and perfection codes following Bernstein (2000) and

               noted by clinicians since 1996 and described in the scientific
               literature, and yet there is no formal recognition of ON as a
               psychiatric diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: Review the latest available
               literature regarding diagnoses similarities, presentation
               uniqueness, assessment/assessment tools, and suggested
               treatments of ON. METHOD/DESIGN: A literature search of four
               databases focusing on articles published between 2000 and 2016
               was conducted to evaluate the status of the literature on
               Orthorexia. RESULTS: Among the 15 articles selected for this
               review, similarities with other psychiatric disorders emerged,
               confusion about use of assessment tools existed, and the lack of
               evidence based treatments for ON was pronounced. CONCLUSION:
               More research is needed to determine the prevalence of
               pathologically unhealthy, obsessive, ``self-defined healthy,''
               eating behaviors, and to determine if ON is a unique eating

               strategies and techniques. A new model of culture-infused

               to form the personal cultural identities of both the counsellor

               dramatic impact on the success of the counselling process and

               enhancing the multicultural competence of practitioners and for
               optimizing therapeutic outcomes with a wide range of clientele.
               The specific attitudes, knowledge, and skills required for

  author   = "McLester, Cherilyn N and Hardin, Robin and Hoppe, Stephanie",
  abstract = "CONTEXT: Research has suggested that the prevalence of young
              women with eating disorders (EDs) is increasing, but determining
              the exact prevalence of EDs within the female student-athlete
              (FS-A) population is difficult. Looking at certain traits may
              help us to identify their level of susceptibility to developing
              an ED. OBJECTIVE: To determine the susceptibility of FS-As to EDs
              in relation to self-concept, including self-esteem and body
              image. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Athletic training
              and health centers at National Collegiate Athletic Association
              Division I, II, and III institutions via e-mail questionnaire
              correspondence. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 439
              FS-As from 17 participating institutions completed the
              questionnaires. The sample was primarily white (83.1\%) and
              underclass (61.8\%). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The questionnaire
              consisted of 4 parts: 3 subscales of the Eating Disorder
              Inventory-2, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Body Cathexis
              Scale, and demographic items. RESULTS: A total of 6.8\% of FS-As
              were susceptible to anorexia and 1.8\% were susceptible to
              bulimia. The majority of FS-As (61\%) reported normal self-esteem
              levels, whereas 29.4\% had high self-esteem. Overall, 64.5\% were
              satisfied and 23\% were very satisfied with their body image.
              CONCLUSIONS: These results are generally positive in that they
              suggest FS-As have high levels of self-concept and are at low
              risk to develop EDs. However, these findings do not mean that all
              concerns should be dismissed. Although more than 90\% of the
              respondents were not susceptible to an ED, there are still FS-As
              who may be. Athletic departments should evaluate their FS-As'
              levels of self-concept so that their susceptibility to EDs can be
              addressed. The emotional aspect of health care should be included
              in providing holistic care for student-athletes. Athletic
              trainers often are the primary health care providers for FS-As,
              so they should be made aware of this concern.",

               pro-anorexia has emerged in recent years as a cultural movement

               toward anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders. The
               empirical literature has documented both the harm and potential
               benefit that these forums offer participants. To date, however,
               pro-ana forums have not been theorized in the psychoanalytic
               literature. In this article, I make use of both a clinical case
               and qualitative investigation of pro-ana forums in an attempt to
               understand how participants make psychological use of them. I
               argue that pro-ana forums are a double-edged sword. On the one
               hand, they may provide participants with a potential space that
               fosters further psychological development, allowing participants
               to play with ideas about relationship, identity, and even
               recovery. On the other, they may provide the opportunity for
               psychic retreat in which cyberspace becomes an escape from a

              psychologically from generativity--giving and caring for the next
              generation--but older adults' perceptions on giving support to
              their children are rarely if ever explored in these studies. The
              current study examines the association between the support that
              aging parents give to one of their middle-aged offspring, their
              perception of this support as rewarding or stressful, and their
              levels of depressive symptoms. DESIGN AND METHODS: The sample
              draws from The Family Exchanges Study and consisted of 337 older
              parents (mean age: 76) who were drawn from a larger study of
              middle-aged adults (i.e., target participants). Older parents
              reported tangible and nontangible forms of support given to the
              target middle-aged child and the extent to which they viewed
              providing such support as stressful and/or rewarding. RESULTS: We
              found significant interactions between tangible support and
              feelings of reward and between nontangible support and feelings
              of stress in explaining parental depressive symptoms. Parents who
              found giving support to be highly rewarding had lower levels of
              depressive symptoms when giving high amounts of tangible support.
              Conversely, parents who view giving support to be highly
              stressful had higher levels of depressive symptoms when they gave
              low amounts of nontangible support. IMPLICATIONS: Findings

              have adverse consequences for older parents left behind. AIMS: To
              describe correlates of outmigration and to estimate any
              association between outmigration of children and depression in
              rural-dwelling older parents. METHOD: Population-based survey of
              1147 parents aged 60 and over in rural Thailand. We randomly
              oversampled parents living without children. We defined an
              outmigrant child as living outside their parent's district, and
              measured depression as a continuous outcome with a Thai version
              of the EURO-D. RESULTS: Outmigration of all children, compared
              with outmigration of some or no children, was independently
              associated with less depression in parents. This association
              remained after taking account of social support, parent
              characteristics, health and wealth. Parents with all children
              outmigrated received more economic remittances and they perceived
              support to be as good as that of those with children close by.
              CONCLUSIONS: Outmigration of children was not associated with
              greater depression in older parents and, after taking account of
              a range of possible covariables, was actually associated with
              less parental depression. This could be explained by pre-existing
              advantages in families sending more migrants and by the economic
              benefits of migration.",

              history of secondary encopresis. At that time, a comprehensive
              assessment revealed functional constipation resulting in
              encopresis. Dexter's symptoms resolved with a combination of
              medication management and behavioral strategies; laxatives were
              discontinued 12 months ago.Dexter's grandmother reports that for
              the past 6 months, her grandson developed encopresis once again.
              However, she notes that, although Dexter had small-volume
              episodes of soiling in the past, he is now passing fully formed
              stools into his underwear. These episodes usually occur once a
              day, either at home or at school. Frustrated, Dexter's

              hematochezia, pain, dysuria, hematuria, urinary incontinence,
              dietary changes, or weight loss. He passes soft stool in his
              underwear once daily without blood or pain. When interviewed
              alone, Dexter denies drug use, depression, or significant social
              stressors. Surprisingly, he seems unconcerned about depression,
              drugs and social stress, and frequently laughs when discussing
              them. His physical examination, including a rectal examination,
              is normal.Dexter's medical history is notable for

              Attending greater hours of care per week was also related to EF;
              however--consistent with theory--the positive association between

               for doing depth psychotherapy with transgender individuals.
               Combining contemporary psychodynamic, Jungian and gender
               identity theory, this approach reflects the unique path of
               transgender identity development. Transgender identity is not
               viewed as inherently pathological. Rather, the issues that
               emerge in psychotherapy with transgender clients, like with all
               people, are about the self and self-in-relation, negotiating
               identity with outer reality. For the transgender person,
               however, psychological issues are particularly related to faulty
               mirroring during periods of identity construction because the
               transgender self is often invisible to the outside world.
               Transgender identity development involves a body/mind mismatch
               and is affected by social stigma associated with gender
               variance. Transgender individuals negotiate their transgendered
               self in a world that sees gender as binary, resulting in a
               tension between desire, authenticity and avoidance of stigma. A

              conceptions of mutual assistance in four ethnic groups reflect
              the nature of social exchange and its role in creating
              continuity. METHODS: We conducted five in-depth interviews over a
              5-year period with 270 respondents aged 50 and up (59 African
              Americans, 85 Latinos, 78 Filipino Americans, and 48 Cambodian
              Americans). We asked both open-ended and semistructured questions
              to determine how respondents viewed their role in mutual
              assistance in the family. RESULTS: Mutual assistance was a
              critical element in intergenerational relations in all four
              groups, as it represented continuity within the family and was a
              part of a broader cultural ethos of family relationships. There
              were differences between groups in overall approach to mutual
              assistance, the factors to which they assigned the greatest
              importance, and the degree of dissatisfaction expressed over
              family relationships. DISCUSSION: Social exchange can be viewed
              not only as a means by which those who are old maintain power but
              as a major vehicle for perpetuating continuity across the
              generations. When social exchange breaks down, elders suffer from
              loss of power as expressed through role loss. Elders must have a
              negotiable commodity to exchange as well as the flexibility to
              adjust to changes in the extended family. Maintaining continuity
              of the family in the face of disruptive threats poses a

              eating in favor of greater attention to physiologic cues, or
              ``body wisdom''. We hypothesized that nutrition students in a
              traditional curriculum would report eating less intuitively than
              non-nutrition majors. We surveyed 258 female undergraduate
              students (96 nutrition majors and 162 non-majors) at the
              University of Massachusetts Amherst. Using Mann-Whitney U tests,
              we assessed the differences between nutrition majors and
              non-majors in terms of: intuitive eating, as measured by the
              Intuitive Eating Scale-2 (IES-2); body mass index (BMI, kg/m2);
              magnitude of body dissatisfaction (actual weight -- ideal
              weight); and dieting behavior. We also used non-parametric
              Spearman's rho correlations and Chi-squared statistics to examine
              relationships between variables. A two-way between-groups
              analysis of variance was used to calculate statistical
              differences in intuitive eating scores between diet behavior and
              major. Contrary to our working hypothesis, we found that IES-2
              scores were significantly higher in majors versus non-majors (p=
              0.01) and significantly lower (pnormalor underweight BMI. These
              observations provide novel information indicating that nutrition
              undergraduate students, who have the intention of becoming
              registered dietitians, report that they eat more intuitively and
              have a lower degree of body dissatisfaction than do undergraduate
              students not majoring in nutrition. Additional research is needed
              to address issues related to body dissatisfaction and body
              weight.",

              related to orthorexia nervosa. The purpose of the present study
              was to validate the Polish version of the ORTHO-15 test. METHODS:
              341 women and 59 men (N = 400) were recruited, whose age ranged
              from 18 to 35 years. Mean age was 23.09 years (SD = 3.14) in
              women and 24.02 years (SD = 3.87) in men. The ORTHO-15 test and
              the EAT-26 test were used in the present study. RESULTS: Factor
              analysis (exploratory and confirmatory analysis) was used in the
              present study. Exploratory factor analysis performed on the
              initial 15 items from a random split half of the study group
              suggested a nine-item two-factor structure. Confirmatory factor
              analysis performed on the second randomly selected half of the
              study group supported this two-factor structure of the ORTHO-15
              test. The Polish version of the ORTHO-15 test demonstrated an
              internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) equal to 0.644.
              CONCLUSION: The Polish version of the ORTHO-15 test is a reliable
              and valuable instrument to assess obsessive attitudes related to

               nervosa--an obsession with eating healthfully--and offer expert
               advice on how to treat it. As Americans become better informed
               about health, more and more people have turned to diet as a way
               to lose weight and keep themselves in peak condition. Anorexia
               nervosa and bulimia nervosa--disorders in which the sufferer
               focuses on the quantity of food eaten--have been highly
               documented over the past decade. But as Dr. Steven Bratman
               asserts in this breakthrough book, for many people, eating
               ``correctly'' has become an equally harmful obsession, one that
               causes them to adopt progressively more rigid diets that not
               only eliminate crucial nutrients and food groups, but ultimately
               cost them their overall health, personal relationships, and
               emotional well-being. Health Food Junkies is the first book to
               identify this new eating disorder, orthorexia nervosa, and to
               offer detailed, practical advice on how to cope with and
               overcome it. Orthorexia nervosa occurs when the victim becomes
               obsessed, not with the quantity of food eaten, but the quality
               of the food. What starts as a devotion to healthy eating can
               evolve into a pattern of incredibly strict diets; victims become
               so focused on eating a ``pure'' diet (usually raw vegetables and
               grains) that the planning and preparation of food come to play
               the dominant role in their lives. Health Food Junkies provides
               an expert analysis of some of today's most popular diets--from
               The Zone to macrobiotics, raw-foodism to food allergy
               elimination--and shows not only how they can lead to orthorexia,
               but how they are often built on faulty logic rather than sound
               medical advice. Offering expert insight gleaned from his work
               with orthorexia patients, Dr. Bratman outlines the symptoms of
               orthorexia, describes its progression, and shows readers how to
               diagnose the condition. Finally, Dr. Bratman offers practical
               suggestions for intervention and treatment, giving readers the
               tools they need to conquer this painful disorder, rediscover the
               joys of eating, and reclaim their lives. From the Hardcover

              eating) is a poorly defined disordered eating behavior that
              results from a pathological obsession with food, its purported
              nutritional value, composition, origin, etc. METHODS: We
              investigated the prevalence of ON in a local ashtanga yoga
              community, by using a validated questionnaire (ORTO-15) that sets
              a threshold of ON diagnosis at $\leq$40. RESULTS: Among the 136
              respondents, the mean ORTO-15 score (which was normally
              distributed) was 35.27 $\pm$ 3.69, i.e., 86 \% of respondents had
              an ORTO-15 score lower than 40 and no significant association
              with age or BMI was recorded. When we analyzed the differential
              distribution of orthorexia in our cohort, we recorded an
              association of ORTO-15 score and vegetarianism, i.e., the ORTO-15
              score was lower among vegetarians. CONCLUSIONS: The results of
              this pilot study should suggest ashtanga yoga teachers to avoid
              excessive reference to a healthy diet, which is natural component

              panel to update the 2005 IOC Consensus Statement on the Female
              Athlete Triad. This Consensus Statement replaces the previous and
              provides guidelines to guide risk assessment, treatment and
              return-to-play decisions. The IOC expert working group introduces
              a broader, more comprehensive term for the condition previously
              known as 'Female Athlete Triad'. The term 'Relative Energy
              Deficiency in Sport' (RED-S), points to the complexity involved
              and the fact that male athletes are also affected. The syndrome
              of RED-S refers to impaired physiological function including, but
              not limited to, metabolic rate, menstrual function, bone health,
              immunity, protein synthesis, cardiovascular health caused by
              relative energy deficiency. The cause of this syndrome is energy
              deficiency relative to the balance between dietary energy intake
              and energy expenditure required for health and activities of
              daily living, growth and sporting activities. Psychological
              consequences can either precede RED-S or be the result of RED-S.
              The clinical phenomenon is not a 'triad' of the three entities of
              energy availability, menstrual function and bone health, but
              rather a syndrome that affects many aspects of physiological
              function, health and athletic performance. This Consensus
              Statement also recommends practical clinical models for the
              management of affected athletes. The 'Sport Risk Assessment and
              Return to Play Model' categorises the syndrome into three groups

              disorder in which the person is excessively preoccupied with
              healthy food. First described by Bratman in 1997, ON entails a
              fixation on healthy food or a health food dependence. The term
              orthorexia nervosa arises from the Greek words orthos (=accurate)
              and orexis (=hunger) meaning obsession with healthy food and
              proper nutrition. Fears and worries about health, eating, and the
              quality of food are significant. Objectives We investigated the
              prevalence of ON in a a population of young Italian adults by
              using a validated questionnaire (ORTO-15). Aims We aimed to
              assess the prevalence of ON in a large sample of general
              population and to identify some possible specific correlation
              such as gender and Body Mass Index (BMI). Methods 1453 adult
              subjects from the general population were administered the
              ORTO-15 test and investigated for gender, age and BMI.
              Statistical analyses were performed referring to diagnostic
              threshold (40). Results Orthorexia had a 10,9\% prevalence in our
              sample, with a female prevalence statistically significant
              (female vs male= 72,8\% vs 27,2\%). Moreover, age and Body Mass
              Index did not seem to be significant factors. Conclusions ON is
              not currently considered as a full-fledged and discrete mental
              disorder. Again, the definition and diagnostic criteria of ON
              remain unclear. Further studies are needed to clarify appropriate

              of EDs and those from the Exercise and Sport Sciences school a
              10-fold higher risk of muscle dysmorphia. The prevalence of
              orthorexia traits was high in all schools (35.9\%, 22.5\%, 26.5\%
              in Dietetics, Biology, and Exercise and Sport Sciences schools,
              respectively). Overall, individuals with traits of any of these
              disorders were more frequently on diet or on supplement use. In a
              logistic regression model, attending the Dietetics school (OR =
              2.71; 95\% CI 1.14-6.48) was significantly associated with the ED
              traits, but not with the orthorexia traits (OR = 1.75; 95\% CI
              0.93-3.29), while attending the Exercise and Sport Sciences
              school was significantly associated with the muscle dysmorphia
              traits (OR = 5.15; 95\% CI 1.44-18.4). Finally, when evaluating
              the relationships among the types of study programs as dependent
              variables and traits of these disturbances, the associations
              between the traits of ED (OR = 3.35; 95\% CI 1.38-8.13) and
              matriculation at the school of Dietetics, and between the traits
              of muscle dysmorphia (OR = 4.32; 95\% CI 1.16-16.1) and the
              choice of the Exercise and Sport Sciences school were confirmed.
              CONCLUSIONS: The choice of the university courses might be
              influenced by pre-existing disorders in eating behaviors, which
              were relatively frequent in the considered sample.",

  abstract = "Bratman first proposed orthorexia nervosa in the late 1990s,
              defining it an obsession with eating healthy food to achieve, for
              instance, improved health. Today, in the Swedish media, excessive
              exercising plays a central role in relation to orthorexia. A few
              review articles on orthorexia have been conducted; however, these
              have not focused on aspects of food and eating, sport, exercise,
              or a societal perspective. The overall aim of this study was to
              provide an overview and synthesis of what philosophies of science
              approaches form the current academic framework of orthorexia. Key
              questions were: What aspects of food and eating are related to
              orthorexia? What role do exercise and sports play in relation to
              orthorexia? In what ways are orthorexia contextualized?
              Consequently, the concept of healthism was used to discuss and
              contextualize orthorexia. The method used was an integrative
              literature review; the material covered 19 empirical and
              theoretical articles published in peer-reviewed journals. This
              review demonstrates a multifaceted nature of orthorexia research;
              this field has been examined from four different philosophies of
              science approaches (i.e., empirical-atomistic,
              empirical-atomistic with elements of empirical-holistic,
              empirical-holistic, and rational-holistic) on individual, social,
              and societal levels. The majority of the articles followed an
              empirical-atomistic approach that focused on orthorexia as an
              individual issue, which was discussed using healthism. Our
              analysis indicates a need for (a) more empirical-holistic
              research that applies interpretive qualitative methods and uses a
              social perspective of health, e.g., healthism and (b) examining
              the role of sports and exercise in relation to orthorexia that
              takes the problematizing of ``orthorexic behaviours'' within the

               developing norms related to health behaviors and body image, and
               social media can influence these norms. Social media is
               saturated with content related to dieting, fitness, and health.
               Health and fitness-related social media content has received
               significant media attention for often containing objectifying
               and inaccurate health messages. Limited research has identified
               problematic features of such content, including stigmatizing
               language around weight, portraying guilt-related messages
               regarding food, and praising thinness. However, no research has
               identified who is ``liking'' or ``following'' (ie, consuming)
               such content. OBJECTIVE: This exploratory study aimed to
               identify demographics, mental health, and substance use-related
               behaviors that predicted consuming 3 types of health and
               fitness-related social media content-weight loss/fitness
               motivation pages (ie, ``fitspiration''), detox/cleanse pages,
               and diet/fitness plan pages-among young social media users.

               cross-sectional 112-question online survey aimed at social media
               users aged between 15-29 years residing in Victoria, Australia.
               Logistic regression was used to determine which characteristics
               predicted consuming the 3 types of health and fitness-related
               social media content. RESULTS: A total of 378 (37.76\%)
               participants reported consuming at least 1 of the 3 types of
               health and fitness-related social media content: 308 (30.77\%)
               fitspiration pages, 145 (14.49\%) detox pages, and 235 (23.48\%)
               diet/fitness plan pages. Of the health and fitness-related
               social media content consumers, 85.7\% (324/378) identified as
               female and 44.8\% (324/723) of all female participants consumed
               at least 1 type of health and fitness-related social media
               content. Predictors of consuming at least one type of health and
               fitness-related social media content in univariable analysis
               included female gender (OR 3.5, 95\% CI 2.5-4.9, P<.001), being
               aged 15-17 years (OR 3.0, 95\% CI 2.2-4.0, P<.001), residing
               outside a major city (OR 2.0, 95\% CI 1.4-2.9, P<.001), having
               no post-high school education (OR 2.2, 95\% CI 1.7-2.9, P<.001),
               being born in Australia (OR 2.0, 95\% CI 1.2-3.2, P=.006),
               having a self-reported eating disorder (OR 2.4, 95\% CI 1.5-3.9,

               social media content were predominantly teenaged girls. There is
               a need to ensure that this social media content portrays
               responsible health messages and to research further the role of

              Questionnaire (the MBSRQ). Relationships between scores on the
              ORTHO-15 and MBSRQ were explored in the 213 students who had high
              levels of preoccupation with a healthy food intake (68.55\% women
              and 43.18\% men, respectively). RESULTS: There were no
              statistically significant differences in the levels of orthorexia
              behaviours between females and males. In female students with
              orthorexia nervosa, preoccupation with consuming healthy food was
              significantly correlated with the MBSRQ subscale scores for
              overweight preoccupation, appearance orientation, fitness

              high body areas (parts) satisfaction, low fitness orientation,
              low overweight preoccupation and low appearance orientation were
              independent predictors of greater fixation on eating healthy
              food. In male students, we found that aspects of body image were

  abstract = "Orthorexia nervosa describes a pathological obsession with proper
              nutrition that is characterized by a restrictive diet, ritualized
              patterns of eating, and rigid avoidance of foods believed to be
              unhealthy or impure. Although prompted by a desire to achieve
              optimum health, orthorexia may lead to nutritional deficiencies,
              medical complications, and poor quality of life. Despite its
              being a distinct behavioral pattern that is frequently observed
              by clinicians, orthorexia has received very little empirical
              attention and is not yet formally recognized as a psychiatric
              disorder. In this review, we synthesize existing research to
              identify what is known about the symptoms, prevalence,
              neuropsychological profile, and treatment of orthorexia. An
              examination of diagnostic boundaries reveals important points of
              symptom overlap between orthorexia and anorexia nervosa,
              obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), obsessive-compulsive
              personality disorder (OCPD), somatic symptom disorder, illness
              anxiety disorder, and psychotic spectrum disorders.
              Neuropsychological data suggest that orthorexic symptoms are
              independently associated with key facets of executive dysfunction
              for which some of these conditions already overlap. Discussion of
              cognitive weaknesses in set-shifting, external attention, and
              working memory highlights the value of continued research to
              identify intermediate, transdiagnostic endophenotypes for insight
              into the neuropathogenesis of orthorexia. An evaluation of
              current orthorexia measures indicates a need for further
              psychometric development to ensure that subsequent research has
              access to reliable and valid assessment tools. Optimized
              assessment will not only permit a clearer understanding of
              prevalence rates, psychosocial risk factors, and comorbid
              psychopathology but will also be needed to index intervention
              effectiveness. Though the field lacks data on therapeutic
              outcomes, current best practices suggest that orthorexia can
              successfully be treated with a combination of

              beta carotene, alpha tocopherol, and ascorbic acid
              concentrations, and 24 hour urinary potassium excretion.
              Assessment at baseline, eight weeks, and 12 months. RESULTS:
              Consumption of fruit and vegetables increased from baseline to 12
              months by 1.5 and 0.9 portions per day in the behavioural and
              nutrition groups (mean difference 0.6 portions, 95\% confidence
              interval 0.1 to 1.1). The proportion of participants eating five
              or more portions a day increased by 42\% and 27\% in the two
              groups (mean difference 15\%, 3\% to 28\%). Plasma beta carotene
              and alpha tocopherol concentrations increased in both groups, but
              the rise in beta carotene was greater in the behavioural group
              (mean difference 0.16 micromol/l, 0.001 micromol/l to 1.34
              micromol/l). There were no changes in plasma ascorbic acid
              concentrations or urinary potassium excretion. Differences were
              maintained when analysis was restricted to the 177 participants
              with incomes < or = pound 400 (596, \$640) a week. CONCLUSIONS:
              Brief individual counselling in primary care can elicit sustained
              increases in consumption of fruit and vegetables in low income
              adults in the general population.",

              outpatients. Both programmes included behaviour modification,
              nutrition counselling, very-low-calorie diet (VLCD) and a
              continuous measuring of metabolic and anthropometrical status,
              but they differed regarding the treatment intensiveness. The main
              aim was to study whether intensive treatment gives a larger
              weight reduction compared with less intensive treatment and what
              level of input from health care personnel is needed to reach
              adequate treatment results. DESIGN: A 2-y randomised clinical
              trial. SUBJECTS: A total of 43 obese subjects aged 24-60 y, BMI
              35 kg/m(2) (29-48). INTERVENTION: Two programmes were used. Both
              were based on group therapy and were supervised by a dietitian
              and a psychologist. Group 1 received a continuous intensive
              treatment with planned group meetings every fortnight during the
              first year and six group meetings the second year. Group 2 had
              planned group meetings every third month. Anthropometrical and
              metabolic data were measured every third month in both groups.
              The VLCD periods were the same. RESULTS: There was no evidence
              that a more intensive treatment promotes a larger weight
              reduction. Weight reduction after 1 y: group 1, -7.6 (+/-0.97)
              kg, BMI -2.6 (+/-0.3) kg/m(2); group 2, -6.4 (+/-1.16) kg, BMI
              -2.2 (+/-0.4) kg/m(2). Weight reduction after 2 y: group 1, -6.8
              (+/-1.4) kg, BMI -2.4 (+/-0.3) kg/m(2); group 2, -8.6 (+/-1.6)
              kg, BMI -3.0 (+/-0.3) kg/m(2). The dropout rate was 26\%.
              CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences in weight
              reduction, compliance or dropout rate between the groups and
              there was no evidence that a more intensive treatment promotes a
              larger weight reduction. This observation is of value when

              anthropometrical status during the treatment and to give
              continuous feedback to the subjects seem to be important factors
              for compliance. Both treatment programmes gave highly significant
              weight reductions in the range of 5-10\%, which has been referred

              and prescribing physical activity, physician demographics, and
              practice characteristics. Registered primary care physicians in
              Canada were contacted in all 10 provinces and 2 territories.
              RESULTS: Of 27 980 primary care physicians, 14 319 returned
              usable questionnaires and 13 166 were eligible for study
              participation (response rate, 51.2\%). Respondents were
              predominantly male (61.1\%), practiced in private office/clinic
              settings (73.4\%), and had graduated from medical school more
              than 22 years earlier. Eighty-five percent of respondents
              reported asking patients about their physical activity levels,
              whereas only 26.2\% assessed patient fitness as part of a
              physical examination or through a fitness test and only 10.9\%
              referred patients to others for fitness assessment or appraisal.
              Most physicians (69.8\%) reported using verbal counseling to
              promote physical activity, whereas only 15.8\% used written
              prescriptions for a physical activity promotion program. Male and

              These disorders have not been officially recognized so that they
              are not classified as independent entities. The term orthorexia
              comes from the Greek word orthos (straight, proper) and orexia
              (appetite). It is characterized by the pathological obsession for
              biologically pure food, which leads to important dietary
              restrictions. Orthorexic patients exclude foods from their diets
              that they consider to be impure because they have herbicides,
              pesticides or artificial substances and they worry in excess
              about the techniques and materials used in the food elaboration.
              This obsession leads to loss of social relationships and
              affective dissatisfactions which, in turn, favors obsessive
              concern about food. In orthorexia, that patient initially wants
              to improve his/her health, treat a disease or lose weight.
              Finally, the diet becomes the most important part of their lives.

              of orthorexia. The differential diagnosis with chronic delusional

               within-participant design, once a week for 3 weeks, children
               consumed one of two breakfasts or no breakfast and then
               completed a battery of cognitive tests. The two breakfasts were

               characteristics, effects on digestion and metabolism, and
               glycemic score. Results with 9 to 11 year-olds replicated
               previous findings showing that breakfast intake enhances
               cognitive performance, particularly on tasks requiring
               processing of a complex visual display. The results extend
               previous findings by showing differential effects of breakfast

               auditory attention and girls exhibited better short-term memory

               protein and fiber content, glycemic scores, and rate of

               examined 3 h after breakfast consumption. RESULTS: Consumption
               of a SCHO breakfast resulted in higher glucose and insulin
               levels at 30 min after breakfast consumption. TG at 180 min, and
               FFA at 180 and 240 min were higher after SCHO breakfast than
               after CCHO breakfast. Satiety scores were higher after CCHO
               breakfast consumption for the first 90 min after intake.
               Furthermore, the item 'fatigue' was scored higher after SCHO
               breakfast than after CCHO breakfast intake. CONCLUSION:
               Consumption of a CCHO breakfast is favourable in comparison to a
               SCHO breakfast, because of the lower perception of 'fatigue' and
               the higher degree of satiety after consumption.",

  author   = "Galloway, R and McGuire, J",
  abstract = "Iron deficiency anemia affects over 2 billion people.
              Particularly at risk are pregnant women and young children.
              Although distribution of iron supplements is practised in many
              antenatal care programs in developing countries, it has often
              been alleged that pregnant women do not take them. Poor
              compliance arises not only because of patient behavior but also
              from factors out of the patient's control. This paper presents
              the results of a review of the literature on medical compliance
              to determine whether iron supplementation is different from other
              medications, to assess the known levels of compliance, and to
              synthesize recommendations for improving compliance relevant to
              iron supplementation. The review showed that compliance with iron
              therapy is a specific case of medical compliance. Reasons for
              non-compliance with iron deficiency treatment include: inadequate
              program support (lack of political commitment and financial
              support); insufficient service delivery (poor provider-user
              dynamics; lack of supplies, access, training, and motivation of
              health care professionals); and patient factors (misunderstanding
              instructions, side effects, frustration about the frequency and
              number of pills taken, migration, fear of having big babies,
              personal problems, nausea that accompanies pregnancy, and the
              subtlety of anemia which makes demand for treatment low). Much
              has been made about the side effects (nausea, constipation, etc.)
              that women might experience during iron therapy as the cause of
              poor compliance with iron supplementation without justification
              according to this review. Instead, unavailability of iron
              supplements was the most common reason why women did not take
              iron supplements. Women bear a disproportionate burden from iron
              deficiency anemia even though the technology exists to address
              the problem at low cost. Governments and health care
              professionals must renew their commitment to iron therapy by
              monitoring and improving compliance. We can significantly improve
              compliance by: making sure that iron supplements are available at
              all times; providing advanced warning about the possibility of
              side effects; involving the patient in the therapeutic strategy;
              and providing reminders, such as posters and calendars, about
              taking supplements.",

              draws from fieldwork and interviews conducted in Quezon City.
              Participants were female ``yayas'' caring for young children
              while they themselves were separated from their own offspring,
              most of whom were left behind in their rural communities.
              Interviews evoked themes reflecting a convergence of broad social
              and economic issues (e.g., rural poverty), gender norms and roles
              (e.g., the role of women in raising children), and traditional
              notions regarding family and parenting (e.g., the role of parents

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Until recently, hoarding was considered an
               obsessive-compulsive symptom (OCS). However, current evidence
               suggests that these two phenotypes may be clinically, and
               perhaps etiologically, distinct. Both hoarding and OCS have a
               genetic etiology, but the degree of unique and shared genetic
               contributions to these phenotypes has not been well studied.
               METHOD: Prevalence rates were assessed for hoarding and OCS in a
               sample of adult twin pairs (n = 7906 twins) and their family
               members from The Netherlands Twin Register (total sample =
               15,914). Using Mplus, genetic analyses using liability threshold
               models were conducted for both phenotypes, for their
               co-morbidity, and for specific hoarding symptoms (cluttering,
               discarding and acquiring). RESULTS: Of the total sample, 6.7\%
               met criteria for clinically significant hoarding; endorsement of
               all three hoarding symptoms was > or = 79\%. Men had slightly
               higher rates than women. Also, 5.7\% met criteria for clinically
               significant OCS; rates were similar in males and females.
               Genetic factors accounted for 36\% of the variance for hoarding
               and 40\% of the variance for OCS. The genetic correlation
               between hoarding and OCS was 0.10. There was no evidence of
               sex-specific genetic contributions for hoarding or OCS. There
               was evidence for a genetic contribution to all hoarding symptom
               subtypes. Only cluttering showed evidence of a contribution from
               the shared environment. CONCLUSIONS: OCS and hoarding are common
               in this population-based sample, have prevalence rates similar
               to those previously reported, and show significant heritability.
               Genetic factors contributed to the co-morbidity of both traits,

  abstract = "The Behavioral Satiety Sequence (BSS) is the name given to the
              orderly transitions of eating, activity grooming and resting
              measured during the postingestive period. Because the BSS is
              considered to reflect the operations of natural physiological
              processes underlying satiety, the sequence can be used to
              discriminate between different drugs (and other manipulations)
              that reduce food intake via these natural physiological
              mechanisms or those that do so by interference. The BSS is only
              produced by the presence of a caloric load in the gut, and the
              preabsorptive satiety factors (such as CCK) the caloric load
              triggers. The BSS is most accurately defined by continuous
              observation rather than time or event sampling techniques
              [Partial Time Sampling (PTS) or Momentary Time Sampling (MTS)].
              Continuous observation also allows the true duration and true
              frequency of each behavior to be analyzed. Continuous observation
              can be used to determine if the profiles associated with the
              reduction in food intake is caused by nausea, sedation,
              hyperactivity, or altered palatability of food. At the present
              time is it possible to identify a number of drugs whose
              suppression of food intake is associated with the disruption or
              preservation of the BSS. Drugs that increase synaptic 5-HT
              activity such d-fenfluramine, fluoxetine. and sibutramine all
              preserve the BSS and advance the onset of resting. The 5-HT1b/2c
              agonists mCPP and TFMPP and the 5-HT1b agonist CP-94,253 produce
              similar effects. However, the 5-HT2 agonist DOI and the 5-HT1a/1b
              agonist RU-24969 disrupt the BSS by inducing hyperactivity as
              does amphetamine. The 5-HT2 agonist MK-212 disrupts the BSS by
              inducing sedation. Selective dopamine agonists, at low doses,
              such as SKF-38393 (DA1) and LY-171555 (DA2) also preserve the
              BSS. However, detailed behavioral analysis of the effects of many

              scale's development and preliminary validation. Methods One
              hundred thirty-four adults, identifying as the relative of
              someone with problematic hoarding (n=102) or normative collecting
              behavior (n=32), completed the FISH alongside measures of
              hoarding severity, burden, functional impairment, and quality of
              life (QoL). Exploratory factor analysis (FA) was used to examine
              the scale's factor structure. Internal consistency, known-groups
              and convergent validity were also investigated. Results FA
              supported two factors, accounting for 65.43\% of variance. Of the
              scale items, 16 were determined to load onto these factors. Items
              that did not load were omitted. The revised scale accounted for
              67.41\% of variance and was characterized by good internal
              consistency ($\alpha$=0.86). This measure also differentiated

              prospective studies of the intergenerational transmission of
              parenting have focused on relatively young parents led us to
              evaluate whether parental age might moderate---and
              attenuate---the intergenerational transmission of parenting. On
              the basis of the seemingly commonsensical assumption that as
              individuals age they often become more psychologically mature and
              have more opportunity to reflect upon and free themselves from
              the legacy of childhood experiences, we hypothesized that
              deferring parenting would weaken links between rearing
              experiences in the family of origin and parenting in the family
              of procreation. To test this proposition we repeated analyses
              reported by Belsky, Jaffee, Sligo, Woodward, and Silva (2005) on
              227 parents averaging 23 years of age linking rearing experiences

              parenting in adulthood; we added 273 participants who became
              parents at older ages than did those in the original sample.
              Although previously reported findings showing that rearing
              history predicted mothering but not fathering reemerged, parental
              age generally failed to moderate the intergenerational
              transmission of parenting. Other investigators prospectively
              following children and adults into adulthood and studying the
              intergenerational transmission process should determine whether
              these null results vis-{\`a}-vis the attenuation of transmission
              with age obtain when parents with older children are studied or

              However, the majority of this research has focused on children
              and young adults. Little is known about mean-level changes in
              attachment orientation beyond early life, in part due to a dearth
              of longitudinal data on attachment across the life span. The
              current study used a Q-Sort-based measure of attachment to
              examine mean-level changes in attachment orientation from age 13
              to 72 using data from the Block and Block Longitudinal Study, the
              Intergenerational Studies, and the Radcliffe College Class of
              1964 Sample (total N = 628). Multilevel modeling was employed to
              estimate growth curve trajectories across the combined samples.
              We found that attachment anxiety declined on average with age,
              particularly during middle age and older adulthood. Attachment
              avoidance decreased in a linear fashion across the life span.
              Being in a relationship predicted lower levels of anxiety and
              avoidance across adulthood. Men were higher in attachment
              avoidance at each point in the life span. Taken together, these
              findings provide much-needed insight into how attachment
              orientations change over long stretches of time. We conclude with

               a sense of meaning and unity with self, people, nature and
               universe. Spirituality may be experienced within or outside
               formal religion. At least in English-speaking countries,
               therapists reported discussing spiritual issues with service
               users more frequently than before. In the literature, there
               continues to be debate regarding definitions of spirituality and
               how spirituality fits with occupational therapy practice models.
               Methods and Results:? To advance the discussion, we explore the
               concept of spirituality among indigenous people of Australia and
               New Zealand, and use mental health as a practice setting to
               suggest how occupational therapists can address the spiritual
               needs of individuals recovering from mental health problems.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The construct of orthorexia in eating disorders (EDs)
              has received very little attention despite clinical observations
              of a possible overlap between the two. The aim of this study was:
              1) to assess orthorexic behaviours, eating disorder pathology and
              attitudinal body image in ED patients; 2) to identify possible
              predictors of orthorexia nervosa among ED patients. METHODS:
              Fifty-two women diagnosed with EDs were recruited. Patients'
              assessment included the following: the ORTO-15 test (Polish
              version) for orthorexic behaviours; the Eating Attitude Test-26
              (EAT-26) to identify ED symptoms; the Multidimensional Body-Self
              Relations Questionnaire (Polish version) to assess body image.
              RESULTS: A latent class analysis was performed and differences
              between identified classes were assessed. The main differences
              concerned weight, ED pathology and orthorexic behaviours within
              the same group of ED patients. In order to examine predictors of
              orthorexia nervosa, we investigated a structural equation model,
              which excellently fitted to the data ($\chi$(2)(17) = 23.05; p =
              .148; CFI = .962; RMSEA = .08; p = .25; SRMR = .05). In ED
              patients, orthorexic behaviour was negatively predicted by eating
              pathology, weight concern, health orientation and appearance
              orientation. CONCLUSION: The assessment of the orthorexia
              construct in EDs may add to the paucity of studies about this
              issue and may help to clarify the relationship between the two.
              Differences and similarities seem to exist between these
              disorders, and may benefit from specific treatment approaches.
              Moreover, these preliminary findings open tracks for future
              research in the field of the psychology of eating.",

               used therapeutic approach that focuses on helping clients
               construct solutions rather than solve problems. The approach
               evolved in a clinical context amid many anecdotal reports of
               success from both therapists and clients, but it has not been
               subjected to controlled empirical testing until very recently.
               In this article we critically review all of the controlled
               outcome studies of SFBT to date (N = 15) to assess the extent to
               which SFBT has received empirical support. Five studies were
               well-controlled and all showed positive outcomes?four found SFBT
               to be better than no treatment or standard institutional
               services, and one found SFBT to be comparable to a known
               intervention: Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depression (IPT).
               Findings from the remaining 10 studies, which we consider
               moderately or poorly controlled, were consistent with a
               hypothesis of SFBT effectiveness. We conclude that the 15
               studies provide preliminary support for the efficacy of SFBT but
               do not permit a definitive conclusion. Our critique highlights
               areas where methodology in future studies can be strengthened to
               provide more conclusive evidence of SFBT efficacy.",

               First, the author comments on the larger social and cultural
               contexts in which gays and lesbians have been and are defined by
               others and by themselves. Second, gay and lesbian families, are
               viewed intergenerationally, with each family member is
               influenced by the specific history and culture of his or her own
               family or origin in its sociocultural; context. Third, in family
               therapy, life-cycle ``stage'' theories have been central in the
               study of individual gay and lesbian identity and development.
               Some attention has more recently turned to the the life cycle of
               the gay couple and of the lesbian family. Then, some of the
               dimensions and metaphors that have been of interest to family
               theorists are considered. Questions are addressed throughout the
               chapter: What can we say at present about family structure and
               process and about how these families are doing? How relevant are
               concepts such as boundary, enmeshment, fusion, and cohesion?
               What can these families teach us about heterosexual families,
               about gender identity and relationships? Do such families have
               unique strengths and face unique kinds of problems? The chapter
               concludes with a brief commentary on what the author sees as

               Solution-focused brief therapy (SFBT) has been gaining momentum
               as a powerful therapeutic approach since its inception in the
               1980s. By focusing on solutions instead of problems, it asks
               clients to set concrete goals and to draw upon strengths in
               their lives that can help bring about the desired change for a
               preferred future. Addressing both researchers and practitioners,

              unneeded items and the accumulation of items within living spaces

              distress. Along with the negative impact of hoarding on the
              individual, HD is substantially impairing for family members, and
              linked to disruptions in family functioning. The present study
              utilized a path model analysis to examine the associations
              between an array of hoarding variables hypothesized to impact
              family functioning and parent-offspring relationships in 150
              adult-aged children of hoarders who responded to online requests
              to participate in a research study. It was hypothesized that
              increased hoarding severity, decreased insight, and increased
              family accommodation (i.e., act of family members facilitating or
              assisting in hoarding behaviors) would be associated with
              decreased family functioning, decreased quality of
              parent-offspring relationships, and increased offspring
              impairment. Results from the path model revealed that family
              functioning mediated the relationship between hoarding severity
              and parent-offspring relationship. Diminished insight in the
              hoarding parent (as reported by the offspring) was associated
              with increased familial conflict and family functioning partially
              mediated the relationship between insight and quality of
              parent-offspring relationship. Increased family accommodation was

               behavioral principles targeting directly relevant clinical
               targets. The second wave was characterized by similar direct
               change efforts guided by social learning and cognitive
               principles that included cognitive in addition to behavioral and
               emotive targets. Various factors seem to have set the stage for
               a third wave, including anomalies in the current literature and
               philosophical changes. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
               is one of a number of new interventions from both behavioral and
               cognitive wings that seem to be moving the field in a different

               basic experimental analysis of human language and cognition,
               Relational Frame Theory (RFT). RFT explains why cognitive fusion
               and experiential avoidance are both ubiquitous and harmful. ACT
               targets these processes and is producing supportive data both at
               the process and outcome level. The third-wave treatments are
               characterized by openness to older clinical traditions, a focus
               on second order and contextual change, an emphasis of function
               over form, and the construction of flexible and effective
               repertoires, among other features. They build on the first- and
               second-wave treatments, but seem to be carrying the behavior

              eating disorders. Disordered eating occurs on a continuum from
              dieting and restrictive eating, abnormal eating behavior, and
              finally clinical eating disorders. The prevalence of eating
              disorders is increased in elite athletes and for this group the
              cause of starting to diet is related to (a) perception of the
              paradigm of appearance in the specific sport, (b) perceived
              performance improvements, and (c) sociocultural pressures for
              thinness or an ``ideal'' body. Athletes most at risk for
              disordered eating are those involved in sports emphasizing a thin
              body size/shape, a high power-to-weight ratio, and/or sports
              utilizing weight categories, such as in some high-intensity
              sports. In addition to dieting, personality factors, pressure to
              lose weight, frequent weight cycling, early start of
              sport-specific training, overtraining, injuries, and unfortunate
              coaching behavior, are important risk factors. To prevent
              disordered eating and eating disorders, the athletes have to
              practice healthy eating, and the medical staff of teams and
              parents must be able to recognize symptoms indicating risk for
              eating disorders. Coaches and leaders must accept that disordered
              eating can be a problem in the athletic community and that

              proper) and orexis (appetite), is a newly conceptualized disorder
              characterized by distorted eating habits and cognitions
              concerning supposedly healthy nutrition. In this article we
              present preliminary results of a wider research aimed to
              investigate the diffusion of Orthorexia in the general population
              and to highlight its characteristics and particularly the
              relationship with Eating Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive
              Disorder. METHOD: One-hundred and seventy seven adult subjects
              from the general population, were administered the ORTO-15 test,
              a selfadministered questionnaire specifically designed to assess
              orthorexic symptomatology; note that statistical analyses were
              repeated twice, referring to different diagnostic thresholds
              (40/35). RESULTS: Orthorexia had a 57.6\% prevalence in our
              sample, using the 40-point threshold, with a female/male ratio
              2:1; the figure was sensibly lower with the 35-point threshold
              (21\%). CONCLUSION: The results of this study highlight the
              diffusion of Orthorexia which may constitute an important risk
              factor for mental and physical health, but also the opportunity
              of more specific diagnostic instruments, so to facilitate a

               behavior analysis. Functional contextualism is the world view

               offers an account of how language creates pain and useless
               methods of dealing with it, and which suggests alternative
               contextual approaches to these domains. ACT uses metaphors,
               experiential exercises, and logical paradox to get around the
               literal content of language and to produce more contact with the
               ongoing flow of experience in the moment. The primary ACT
               components are challenging the control agenda, cognitive
               defusion, willingness, self as context, values, and commitment.
               ACT is part of the CBT tradition, although it has notable

               however, it was not until the medieval ages that food was
               considered a tool to modify temperament and mood, although
               scientific methods as we know them today were not in use at the
               time. Modern scientific methods in neuroscience began to emerge
               much later, leading investigators to examine the role of diet in
               health, including mental wellbeing, with greater precision. This
               review shows how short- and long-term forced dietary
               interventions bring about changes in brain structure, chemistry,
               and physiology, leading to altered animal behavior. Examples
               will be presented to show how diets alter brain chemistry,
               behavior, and the action of neuroactive drugs. Most humans and
               most animal species examined in a controlled setting exhibit a
               fairly reproducible pattern of what and how they eat. Recent
               data suggest that these patterns may be under the neurochemical
               and hormonal control of the organisms themselves. Other data
               show that in many instances food may be used unconsciously to
               regulate mood by seemingly normal subjects as well as those
               undergoing drug withdrawal or experiencing seasonal affective
               disorders and obesity-related social withdrawal. We will discuss

               were different for men and women, and for older and younger

              to be increasingly stressful for students in higher education,
              but there is limited research about the extent to which those
              attending student counselling services experience difficulties
              relating to academic issues and how effective counselling is for
              them. Aim The study aimed to evaluate the reliable and clinically
              significant change for students with self-reported academic
              issues. Reliable change occurs when a change in the outcome being
              measured is not attributable to error, while clinically
              significant change occurs when a person moves from a clinical
              population to a healthy population after an intervention, in this
              case counselling. Methodology Pre-existing data from 129
              university students who had attended a student counselling
              service were analysed to determine levels of reliable change and
              clinically significant change. These data related to
              psychological status before and after counselling based on
              CORE-OM total scores; self-report of the impact of counselling on
              academic issues; and demographic variables. Findings In total,
              117 (92\%) of students reported experiencing academic issues to
              some extent. Counselling was found to result in reliable change
              for 67\% and clinically significant change for 40\% of those
              students reporting academic issues. Implications The results of
              the study suggest that, even where academic reasons are not the
              primary cause of referral to student counselling services, a
              significant number of students will also experience difficulties
              in these areas. Counselling was, however, shown to result in
              reliable and clinically significant change in a high percentage

               Questionnaire based on repeatability of the responses presents a

               analysis based on the value of the Cronbach's $\alpha$ reached a
               satisfactory level (0.7--0.9). The ORTO-15 questionnaire was

  abstract  = "Popularized by Michael Pollan in his best-selling In Defense of
               Food, Gyorgy Scrinis's concept of nutritionism refers to the
               reductive understanding of nutrients as the key indicators of
               healthy food -- an approach that has dominated nutrition
               science, dietary advice, and food marketing. Scrinis argues this
               ideology has narrowed and in some cases distorted our
               appreciation of food quality, such that even highly processed
               foods may be perceived as healthful depending on their content
               of ``good'' or ``bad'' nutrients. Investigating the butter
               versus margarine debate, the battle between low-fat, low-carb,
               and other weight-loss diets, and the food industry's strategic
               promotion of nutritionally enhanced foods, Scrinis reveals the
               scientific, social, and economic factors driving our modern
               fascination with nutrition.Scrinis develops an original
               framework and terminology for analyzing the characteristics and
               consequences of nutritionism since the late nineteenth century.
               He begins with the era of quantification, in which the idea of
               protective nutrients, caloric reductionism, and vitamins'
               curative effects took shape. He follows with the era of good and
               bad nutritionism, which set nutricentric dietary guidelines and
               defined the parameters of unhealthy nutrients; and concludes
               with our current era of functional nutritionism, in which the
               focus has shifted to targeted nutrients, superfoods, and optimal
               diets. Scrinis's research underscores the critical role of
               nutrition science and dietary advice in shaping our relationship
               to food and our bodies and in heightening our nutritional
               anxieties. He ultimately shows how nutritionism has aligned the
               demands and perceived needs of consumers with the commercial
               interests of food manufacturers and corporations. Scrinis also
               offers an alternative paradigm for assessing the healthfulness
               of foods -- the food quality paradigm -- that privileges food
               production and processing quality, cultural-traditional
               knowledge, and sensual-practical experience, and promotes less
               reductive forms of nutrition research and dietary advice.",

              intake, adipocyte size, fat mass, and body protein. A decrease in
              NPY immunostaining in the paraventricular nucleus, without
              changes in the arcuate, was observed. However, no changes were
              observed in the number of neural cells immunostained for orexin A
              or orexin B in the lateral hypothalamic area. DISCUSSION: Due to
              the hyperphagic effect of NPY in the paraventricular nucleus,
              these results suggest that NPY, but not orexins, could be
              involved in the anorexigenic effect of fluoxetine in obese Zucker
              rats.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In eating disorders (EDs) treatment, outcome
              measurement has traditionally focused on symptom reduction rather
              than functioning or quality of life (QoL). Generic QoL measures
              lack sensitivity for some diagnoses and many not be responsive in
              eating disorder patients. This article describes the development
              and validation of a condition-specific QoL measure for
              adolescents and adults with eating disorders--the Eating
              Disorders Quality of Life Scale (EDQLS). METHODS: Multi-source
              and multi-stage methods were used to develop the EDQLS, with
              participation of patients with EDs, their family members and ED
              treatment providers. Sources for domain and item development
              included 39 articles, 12 patient and 10 treatment provider
              interviews, and 31 first person narratives from the internet.
              Four stages of validation and pre-testing involving 17 patients,
              10 family members and 18 providers reduced 233 items to 40 items
              in 12 domains. These items were pilot tested in 41 ED patients.
              RESULTS: The final instrument was then validated in a 12 site
              sample of 171 individuals aged 14-60 with EDs. All items showed
              good dispersion. The total raw mean score was 110 out of 200 (SD
              27.6) with higher scores indicating better QoL. Internal
              consistency was excellent (Cronbach's alpha = .96) and subscale
              internal consistency ranged from alpha .36 to .79 providing
              evidence for a strong overall construct and some
              multi-dimensionality. Validity was supported by significant
              differences in mean EDQLS according to severity levels on the
              EDI-2 (F = 95.3, p <.001) and the BSI (F = 86.9, p <.001). EDQLS
              scores were positively associated with time in treatment (F =
              4.65, p = .01) suggesting responsiveness. A strong positive
              association was also found between EDQLS scores and stage of
              change (F = 15.1 p <.001). Pearson's correlations between the
              EDQLS and criterion instrument scores were .71 for the SF-12
              mental subscale, .61 for the QoLI and .78 for the 16D, supporting
              construct validity. Exploratory principal components and item
              response theory analyses identified only a few poor fitting
              items. CONCLUSION: The EDQLS has promising psychometric
              characteristics and may be useful for evaluating ED treatment

              migraine-preventive therapy. DESIGN: A 26-week, randomized,
              double-blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Outpatient
              treatment at 49 US clinical centers. Patients Patients were aged
              12 to 65 years, had a 6-month International Headache Society
              migraine history, and experienced 3 to 12 migraines per month,
              but had 15 or fewer headache days per month during the 28-day
              baseline period. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to
              placebo or topiramate, 50, 100, or 200 mg/d, titrated by 25 mg/wk
              to the assigned dose or as tolerated in 8 weeks; maintenance
              therapy continued for 18 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The
              primary efficacy assessment was a reduction in mean monthly
              migraine frequency across the 6-month treatment phase. Secondary
              end points were responder rate, time to onset of action, mean
              change in migraine days per month, and mean change in rescue
              medication days per month. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-seven
              patients were randomized, and 469 composed the intent-to-treat
              population. The mean +/- SD monthly migraine frequency decreased
              significantly for the 100-mg/d group (from 5.4 +/- 2.2 to 3.3 +/-
              2.9; P <.001) and the 200-mg/d group (from 5.6 +/- 2.6 to 3.3 +/-
              2.9; P <.001) vs the placebo group (from 5.6 +/- 2.3 to 4.6 +/-
              3.0); improvements occurred within the first treatment month.
              Significantly more topiramate-treated patients (50 mg/d, 35.9\%
              [P =.04]; 100 mg/d, 54.0\% [P <.001]; and 200 mg/d, 52.3\% [P
              <.001]) exhibited a 50\% or more reduction in monthly migraine
              frequency than placebo-treated patients (22.6\%). Adverse events
              included paresthesia, fatigue, nausea, anorexia, and taste per

               about their relative or combined efficacy. METHODS: In this
               randomized, controlled trial, we assigned 488 children between
               the ages of 7 and 17 years who had a primary diagnosis of
               separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or
               social phobia to receive 14 sessions of cognitive behavioral
               therapy, sertraline (at a dose of up to 200 mg per day), a
               combination of sertraline and cognitive behavioral therapy, or a
               placebo drug for 12 weeks in a 2:2:2:1 ratio. We administered
               categorical and dimensional ratings of anxiety severity and
               impairment at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, and 12. RESULTS: The
               percentages of children who were rated as very much or much
               improved on the Clinician Global Impression-Improvement scale
               were 80.7\% for combination therapy (P<0.001), 59.7\% for
               cognitive behavioral therapy (P<0.001), and 54.9\% for
               sertraline (P<0.001); all therapies were superior to placebo
               (23.7\%). Combination therapy was superior to both monotherapies
               (P<0.001). Results on the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale
               documented a similar magnitude and pattern of response;
               combination therapy had a greater response than cognitive
               behavioral therapy, which was equivalent to sertraline, and all
               therapies were superior to placebo. Adverse events, including
               suicidal and homicidal ideation, were no more frequent in the
               sertraline group than in the placebo group. No child attempted
               suicide. There was less insomnia, fatigue, sedation, and

               with sertraline. CONCLUSIONS: Both cognitive behavioral therapy
               and sertraline reduced the severity of anxiety in children with

              accuracy of depression screening instruments; (2) the effect of
              depression treatment on depression and cardiac outcomes; and (3)
              the effect of screening on depression and cardiac outcomes in
              patients in cardiovascular care settings. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE,
              PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, ISI, SCOPUS, and Cochrane databases
              from inception to May 1, 2008; manual journal searches; reference
              list reviews; and citation tracking of included articles. STUDY
              SELECTION: We included articles in any language about patients in
              cardiovascular care settings that (1) compared a screening
              instrument to a valid major depressive disorder criterion
              standard; (2) compared depression treatment with placebo or usual
              care in a randomized controlled trial; or (3) assessed the effect
              of screening on depression identification and treatment rates,
              depression, or cardiac outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION: Methodological
              characteristics and outcomes were extracted by 2 investigators.
              RESULTS: We identified 11 studies about screening accuracy, 6
              depression treatment trials, but no studies that evaluated the
              effects of screening on depression or cardiovascular outcomes. In
              studies that tested depression screening instruments using a
              priori-defined cutoff scores, sensitivity ranged from 39\% to
              100\% (median, 84\%) and specificity ranged from 58\% to 94\%
              (median, 79\%). Depression treatment with medication or cognitive
              behavioral therapy resulted in modest reductions in depressive
              symptoms (effect size, 0.20-0.38; r(2), 1\%-4\%). There was no
              evidence that depression treatment improved cardiac outcomes.
              Among patients with depression and history of myocardial
              infarction in the ENRICHD trial, there was no difference in
              event-free survival between participants treated with cognitive
              behavioral therapy supplemented by an antidepressant vs usual
              care (75.5\% vs 74.7\%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Depression
              treatment with medication or cognitive behavioral therapy in
              patients with cardiovascular disease is associated with modest
              improvement in depressive symptoms but no improvement in cardiac
              outcomes. No clinical trials have assessed whether screening for

              Procedures (IRAPs) to examine their implicit beliefs concerning
              actual (e.g., I am thin) and desired ideal body image (e.g., I
              want to be thin). Body dissatisfaction was examined via
              self-report questionnaires and rating scales. As expected,
              differences in body dissatisfaction exerted a differential
              influence on the two IRAP scores. Specifically, the implicit
              belief that one is thin was lower in participants who exhibited a
              high degree of body dissatisfaction than in participants who
              exhibited a low degree of body dissatisfaction. In contrast, the

              dissatisfaction than in participants who were less dissatisfied

              measures captured different underlying constructs, we also
              observed that they correlated differently with body mass index,
              explicit body dissatisfaction, and explicit measures of actual
              and ideal body image. More generally, these findings underscore
              the advantage of using implicit measures that incorporate

              fluoxetine (40 mg) or placebo at 0930 daily. Food intake,
              performance and subjective ratings were measured throughout the
              day. The interaction between fluoxetine and carbohydrate
              consumption was examined by providing subjects diets that
              engendered varied levels of carbohydrate intake. When subjects
              received placebo and had access to a regular diet, they consumed
              3400 kcal day-1 (53\% carbohydrate, 34\% fat, 13\% protein); and
              fluoxetine decreased caloric intake to 2770 Kcal, without
              affecting macronutrient contribution. Caloric intake (2730 Kcal;
              67\% carbohydrate) under the high-carbohydrate condition when
              subjects received fluoxetine was not different from intake under
              the regular-diet fluoxetine conditions. Subjects reported that
              the high-fat (low-carbohydrate) diet was less palatable and
              consumed 2975 Kcal under placebo conditions (35\% carbohydrate);
              fluoxetine decreased caloric intake by an additional 400 Kcal
              without affecting macronutrient contribution. There was no
              evidence that carbohydrate intake modulated the effects of
              fluoxetine. Fluoxetine decreased food intake by decreasing the
              number of eating occasions. Performance and subjective measures
              were not significantly altered by fluoxetine compared to placebo.
              Thus, there was no evidence of a specific effect of fluoxetine on
              macronutrient consumption, nor were the effects of fluoxetine
              altered by the macronutrient composition of the available diet.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: This prospective study tested the diathesis-stress
              and causal mediation components of Beck's (1967, 1983) cognitive
              theory of depression. DESIGN: In order to allow for a stringent
              test of the aetiological component of Beck's theory, we used a
              short-term longitudinal design in which participants'
              dysfunctional attitudes were assessed prior to the occurrence of
              a negative event. METHODS: In all, 136 high school seniors
              applying to the University of Pennsylvania completed measures of
              depressed mood and dysfunctional attitudes 1-8 weeks before
              receiving their admissions decision (Time 1). The assessment of
              dysfunctional attitudes was preceded by a priming task designed
              to activate latent depressogenic schemata. Participants also
              completed measures of depressed mood, negative views of the self,
              and negative views of the future shortly after they received
              their admissions decision (Time 2) and four days later (Time 3).
              RESULTS: Consistent with the diathesis-stress component of Beck's
              theory, dysfunctional attitudes predicted increases in depressed
              mood immediately following a negative admissions outcome (Time
              2). In addition, consistent with the causal mediation component
              of the theory, in negative outcome students, the relationship
              between dysfunctional attitudes and increases in depressed mood
              was mediated by negative views of the future. Contrary to
              predictions, however, this relationship was not mediated by
              negative views of the self. In addition, contrary to predictions,
              dysfunctional attitudes did not predict enduring depressed mood
              after a negative outcome (Time 3). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with
              dysfunctional attitudes are likely to show increases in depressed
              mood following the occurrence of negative events. The
              relationship between dysfunctional attitudes and increases in
              depressed mood following the occurrence of negative events is
              mediated by negative views of the future.",

  author   = "Aldao, Amelia",
  abstract = "Emotion regulation has been conceptualized as a process by which
              individuals modify their emotional experiences, expressions, and
              physiology and the situations eliciting such emotions in order to
              produce appropriate responses to the ever-changing demands posed
              by the environment. Thus, context plays a central role in emotion
              regulation. This is particularly relevant to the work on emotion
              regulation in psychopathology, because psychological disorders
              are characterized by rigid responses to the environment. However,
              this recognition of the importance of context has appeared
              primarily in the theoretical realm, with the empirical work
              lagging behind. In this review, the author proposes an approach
              to systematically evaluate the contextual factors shaping emotion
              regulation. Such an approach consists of specifying the
              components that characterize emotion regulation and then
              systematically evaluating deviations within each of these
              components and their underlying dimensions. Initial guidelines
              for how to combine such dimensions and components in order to
              capture substantial and meaningful contextual influences are
              presented. This approach is offered to inspire theoretical and

              false-belief situations), three tasks of metacognition and self-
              regulation (puzzle arrangement and sorting tasks). Metacognition

              highest among youth and young adults. Relatively little is known
              about where they seek support and the factors related to
              help-seeking. DATA AND METHODS: Based on the 2012 Canadian
              Community Health Survey-Mental Health, this study describes
              professional and informal mental health support reported by
              Canadians aged 15 to 24. RESULTS: In 2012, 12\% of 15- to
              24-year-olds reported that, in the previous 12 months, they had
              consulted health professionals about emotional, mental or
              substance use problems; 27\% reported consulting informal sources
              such as family and friends. Young Canadians with mood, anxiety or
              substance disorders, one or more chronic physical conditions,
              higher levels of distress, or who had a traumatic childhood

              informal sources of support. Those with multiple needs-related

              quarter sought informal support for mental health problems in the

              answer the question: Do bereavement counselors inspire hope in
              their clients, and if so, how? The study used a modified grounded
              theory method and collected data, by means of interviews, from a

              Past research has shown that hope and optimism are negatively

              1998 Scottish Health Survey a composite measure of healthy eating

              salt, refined sugar and saturated fat and higher consumption of

              paper presents results from logistic regression analysis of the

              METHOD: The study included 994 participants aged between 19 and
              66 years. ORTO-15, the Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory,
              and the Eating Attitude Test-40 were administered to the

              explained 40.62\% of the variance. When 4 items with factor
              loadings below+/- 0.50 were eliminated from ORTO-15, the
              Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.62. The remaining 11 items
              were thought to have statistically satisfactory properties for
              the Turkish version of ORTO and were collectively referred to as

              controls. Orthorexic tendencies were lower in the more advanced
              nutrition students. Healthy food choices did not differ among
              students in the first year. More advanced nutrition students
              showed healthier food choices, whereas the corresponding controls
              showed slightly more unhealthy food choices. CONCLUSIONS:
              Nutrition students, more than other students, tend to restrict
              their food intake in order to control their weight, but they do
              not have more disturbed or disordered eating patterns than other
              students. Moreover, during the course of their studies, they
              adopt slightly more healthy food choices and decrease their
              tendency to be obsessive in their eating behaviour.",

              mental health promotion, selective prevention, indicated

              summary of the features commonly associated with universal

              type of definition, coupled with Foxcroft's (2014) tripartite

              40\%-50\% recovery rate. Most of these reviews have focused on
              reductions of binge eating and purging; however, the cognitive
              model of BN that underlies the CBT approach identifies three

              work presents a new instrument, the Yale-Brown-Cornell Eating
              Disorder Scale (YBC-EDS), that does not limit assessment to a
              particular set of eating-related concerns or behaviors. Rather,
              it assesses the severity of illness associated with an
              individual's unique symptomatology. Reliability and validity of
              this new, clinician-rated instrument was tested in two
              independent samples of DSM-III-R eating disorder patients. The
              YBC-EDS eight-item scale assessing severity of preoccupations and

              motivation for change were both frequently endorsed and found to
              have excellent interrater reliability. Internal consistency was
              shown to be good for the set of eight core items and the set of
              six items related to motivation for change. The eight-item scale

              METHODS: Eating disorder risk was assessed with the Eating
              Attitudes Test (EAT) and body dissatisfaction and perceptual
              attractiveness determined with the Bodybuilder Image Grid (BIG).
              RESULTS: There was a positive correlation (r=.16, p<.01) between
              the EAT and fat dissatisfaction and a negative correlation
              (r=-.14, p<.05) for muscle dissatisfaction, 28\% of the males had

              4 U.S. and 3 international female samples, as well as a U.S. male
              sample. In Study 1, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses

              859) indicated a 22-item scale with 5 factors: Internalization:
              Thin/Low Body Fat, Internalization: Muscular/Athletic, Pressures:
              Family, Pressures: Media, Pressures: Peers. This scale structure

              demonstrated excellent reliability and good convergent validity

              convergent validity of the SATAQ-4 in an international sample of

  abstract = "A variety of recent research has suggested that the feeding
              associated with enhanced neuropeptide Y (NPY) activity within the
              hypothalamus may operate in part by interacting antagonistically
              with other neural processes responsive to serotonin
              (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT). To test this possibility further,
              experiments were performed to determine if the magnitude of
              feeding produced by injecting NPY into the paraventricular
              nucleus (PVN) or the perifornical hypothalamus (PFH) was
              diminished by coinjections of 5-HT into these two sites or
              peripheral injections of the 5-HT agonist, d-fenfluramine. Adult
              male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted unilaterally with
              stainless steel cannulae aimed to terminate either in the PVN or
              the PFH. In both studies, NPY (235 pmol) produced significant
              feeding in both sites either 1 or 2 h after injection when
              compared to saline. This enhanced feeding response was
              significantly greater in the PFH 2 h after injection (40\% in the
              central study; 70\% in the peripheral study). Coinjection of 5-HT
              (6.3, 12.5, or 25.0 nmol) into either site had no effect on the
              induction of this NPY-induced feeding response. However,
              peripherally injected d-fenfluramine (0.32, 0.63, or 1.25 mg/kg)
              produced strong dose-dependent attenuation both 1- and 2-h food
              intake elicited by 235 pmol NPY in either site, with the PFH
              being proportionately more sensitive to this effect. Viewed
              together, these results suggest that the feeding-suppressant
              effects of systemic fenfluramine on hypothalamic NPY-induced
              feeding may operate largely via peripheral mechanisms and/or
              central ones that have little to do with its 5-HT agonistic
              effects within the PVN or PFH.",

               ``pure'' or ``healthy'' foods. Despite emergent interest, few
               studies have been published about orthorexia to date. This study
               examined the phenomenology, correlates, and associated
               impairment of orthorexia in 404 undergraduate students. A
               battery of self-report questionnaires assessed orthorexia
               symptoms, related functional impairment, disordered eating,
               perfectionism, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, appearance
               anxiety, fear of negative evaluation, anxiety, and depressive
               symptoms. In total, 35.4\% of participants endorsed elevated
               orthorexia symptoms, with primary concerns related to guilt
               associated with dietary transgressions and experiencing control
               when eating in a desired manner. Orthorexia symptoms
               demonstrated small to medium correlations with associated
               impairment variables, perfectionism, disordered eating,
               appearance anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Mean
               differences were observed across all variables (except
               depressive symptoms) between individuals elevated and not
               elevated on orthorexia symptoms. Collectively, this study
               suggests a relatively high frequency of orthorexia symptoms
               using current methods (which have significant limitations) and
               demonstrate fairly modest associations with psychological

              any differences between genders and among different age-groups.
              The research instrument was an Eating Habits Questionnaire (EHQ)
              which consisted of 35 items. There were 382 respondents involved
              in the study. The reliability and factor structure of the
              questionnaire were verified by using factor analysis. The results
              of MANOVA showed that there is a significant difference in the
              habits concerning healthy eating between men and women [F
              (3,378)=4.26, p=0.006; Wilks' Lambda=0.97]. When the results for
              the dependent variables (knowledge, problems, and feelings) were
              considered separately, it was determined that there is no
              significant difference between men and women, which confirms the
              results of the t-test. The effect of age on the three dimensions
              of healthy eating habits was examined within three age-groups, by
              using ANOVA. The results showed that knowledge about healthy
              eating increases with age [F (2,379)=6.14, p=0.002] as well as
              positive feelings which occur as a result of healthy eating [F

              self-administered, online questionnaire consisting of five
              measures: ORTO-15, the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale
              (MPS), the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations
              Questionnaire-Appearance Scale (MBSRQ-AS), the Relationship
              Scales Questionnaire (RSQ), and Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale
              (RSES). RESULTS: Correlation analysis revealed that higher
              orthorexic tendencies significantly correlated with higher scores
              for perfectionism (self-oriented, others-oriented and socially
              prescribed), appearance orientation, overweight preoccupation,
              self-classified weight, and fearful and dismissing attachment
              styles. Higher orthorexic tendencies also correlated with lower
              scores for body areas satisfaction and a secure attachment style.
              There was no significant correlation between orthorexia nervosa
              and self-esteem. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed
              that overweight preoccupation, appearance orientation and the
              presence of an eating disorder history were significant
              predictors of orthorexia nervosa with a history of an eating
              disorder being the strongest predictor. CONCLUSIONS: Orthorexia
              nervosa shares similarities with anorexia nervosa and bulimia
              nervosa with regards to perfectionism, body image attitudes, and
              attachment style. In addition, a history of an eating disorder
              strongly predicts orthorexia nervosa. These findings suggest that

  author    = "Turner, Pixie G and Lefevre, Carmen E",
  abstract  = "PURPOSE: Social media use is ever increasing amongst young
               adults and has previously been shown to have negative effects on
               body image, depression, social comparison, and disordered
               eating. One eating disorder of interest in this context is
               orthorexia nervosa, an obsession with eating healthily. High
               orthorexia nervosa prevalence has been found in populations who
               take an active interest in their health and body and is
               frequently comorbid with anorexia nervosa. Here, we investigate
               links between social media use, in particularly Instagram and
               orthorexia nervosa symptoms. METHODS: We conducted an online
               survey of social media users (N = 680) following health food
               accounts. We assessed their social media use, eating behaviours,
               and orthorexia nervosa symptoms using the ORTO-15 inventory.
               RESULTS: Higher Instagram use was associated with a greater
               tendency towards orthorexia nervosa, with no other social media
               channel having this effect. In exploratory analyses Twitter
               showed a small positive association with orthorexia symptoms.
               BMI and age had no association with orthorexia nervosa. The
               prevalence of orthorexia nervosa among the study population was
               49\%, which is significantly higher than the general population
               (<1\%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the healthy eating
               community on Instagram has a high prevalence of orthorexia
               symptoms, with higher Instagram use being linked to increased
               symptoms. These findings highlight the implications social media
               can have on psychological wellbeing, and the influence social
               media 'celebrities' may have over hundreds of thousands of
               individuals. These results may also have clinical implications
               for eating disorder development and recovery.",

              with 10 mg/kg fluoxetine for 12-23 days. In the first experiment,
              body weight and vaginal smears were monitored daily. Fluoxetine
              treatment reduced body weight within the first 24 h of treatment.
              Fluoxetine treatment also elongated the estrous cycle, reduced
              blood levels of progesterone, and eliminated lordosis behavior.
              In the second experiment, body weight and food intake were
              examined and a pair-fed group was included to determine if
              fluoxetine-induced anorexia contributed to the disturbance of the
              estrous cycle. In pair-fed rats, effects similar to fluoxetine
              treatment were present. These results lead to the suggestion that
              fluoxetine's anorectic properties could disrupt the female's
              normal endocrine cyclicity and that this disruption could be
              relevant to the reduction in sexual behavior and motivation.
              However, when the duration of fluoxetine treatment was extended
              beyond 16 to 17 days, fluoxetine-treated female rats reinitiated
              vaginal cyclicity and showed evidence of normal sexual
              receptivity. In contrast, the estrous cycles of their pair-fed
              counterparts remained disrupted. Thus, restricted food intake
              appears to contribute to the disruption of the estrous cycle and
              elimination of sexual receptivity during fluoxetine treatment.
              However, compensatory changes in the serotonergic system that are
              associated with chronic fluoxetine administration may contribute
              to the gradual recovery of estrous cyclicity and sexual
              receptivity of the fluoxetine-treated animals.",

  author    = "Lee, L M and Henderson, D K",
  abstract  = "A substantial body of evidence provides support (but not
               definitive proof of efficacy) for the use of antiretroviral
               agents as postexposure prophylaxis for occupational exposures to
               HIV in the healthcare workplace. Despite the lack of definitive
               evidence of the efficacy of these agents in this setting, over
               the past decade this intervention has become the standard of
               care for healthcare workers who sustain occupational exposures
               to HIV. Administration of these agents--even for a relatively
               short 28-day postexposure course--is often fraught with
               difficulty. All of the agents currently used for postexposure
               prophylaxis regimens have substantial adverse effects, and
               significant adverse effects occur in more than two-thirds of
               individuals electing prophylaxis. This manuscript reiterates
               current US Federal Government guidelines for the administration
               of postexposure prophylaxis, specifically noting that zidovudine
               plus lamivudine (with or without a protease inhibitor) remains
               the recommended regimen. The paper summarises the significant
               toxicities associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase
               inhibitors (primarily nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and bone
               marrow suppression), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
               inhibitors (rash, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms and
               hepatitis, including hepatic decompensation necessitating liver
               transplantation) and protease inhibitors (nausea, vomiting,
               diarrhoea, abdominal pain, hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia,
               headache and anorexia). As a class, the antiretroviral agents
               have an extraordinary number of drug interactions. The
               non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and the protease
               inhibitors are metabolised through the cytochrome P450 pathway,
               and the effects of concomitant administration of protease
               inhibitors with other agents in the same class are discussed, as
               well as the effects of concomitant administration of protease
               inhibitors with non-nucleoside agents. The potential for
               numerous and medically risky drug interactions emphasises the
               importance of planning antiretroviral prophylaxis in
               consultation with practitioners or clinical pharmacists who are
               skilled in the use of these agents and knowledgeable about the
               potential for significant drug interactions that could either
               reduce the benefit of prophylaxis or increase the potential for
               toxicity. Another common problem encountered by individuals
               managing postexposure prophylaxis programmes relates to the
               administration of chemoprophylaxis to a pregnant healthcare
               worker who has sustained an occupational exposure to HIV. We
               address what is known about the potential for toxicity and
               emphasise the recently published warning concerning the deaths

              associated with adverse health consequences, including increased
              risk for body dissatisfaction and disordered eating behaviors,
              which are risk factors for eating disorders. Although concerns
              about these problems have stimulated calls for broader
              intervention efforts in schools, actions thus far have been
              limited. This study examined educators' perspectives about
              potential policy actions to address these issues in schools.
              METHODS: Educators (N = 240) completed an online questionnaire
              assessing their support for 11 potential school-based policy
              actions to address weight-related bullying and eating disorders.
              Participants also rated policies according to their feasibility
              and potential for positive impact. RESULTS: Forty-eight percent
              of participants observed weight-related bullying in their school
              and 99\% expressed the importance of intervening in such
              incidents. A large majority (75\%-94\%) supported 8 of the 11
              policies, especially actions requiring school-based health
              curriculum to include content on eating disorder prevention
              (94\%), and addressing weight-bullying through antibullying
              policies (92\%), staff training (89\%), and school curriculum
              (89\%). Strongly supported policies were viewed by participants
              as being the most impactful and feasible to implement.
              CONCLUSIONS: Educators recognize weight-related bullying and

              eating disorders (ED) with four Axis II personality disorders
              (PD) and with major depressive disorder (MDD) without PD. The
              eating disorders met criteria outlined in the 4th edition of the
              Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).
              METHOD: Six hundred sixty-eight patients recruited for the
              Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS)
              were reliably assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for
              DSM-IV Axis I Disorders and the Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV
              Personality Disorders. The distribution of ED diagnoses was
              compared among four PD study groups (schizotypal, borderline,
              avoidant, obsessive-compulsive) and a fifth study group with MDD
              without any PD. RESULTS: The distribution of lifetime diagnoses
              of anorexia nervosa (N = 40), bulimia nervosa (N = 56), and
              eating disorder not otherwise specified (N = 118) did not differ
              significantly across the five study groups, between the MDD group
              versus all PD groups, and among the four PD study groups.
              CONCLUSIONS: ED diagnoses did not differentially co-occur
              significantly across common Axis I and II disorders. The pattern
              of ED lifetime co-occurrence rates demonstrates the powerful
              influence of base rates and highlights that declarations of
              comorbidity demand significant variations from base-rate
              patterns.",

              Diagnoses of ON was based on the presence of a disorder with
              obsessive-compulsive personality. The study is a cross-sectional
              research, which reached out to the entire 318 MD. The ORTO-15
              test was used to propose a diagnostic proceeding and to try
              verify the prevalence of ON. Those subjects who were classified
              below 40 from the ORTO-15 test are accepted to have ON.
              Chi-square test, ANOVA (univariate) analysis and logistic
              regression were used for analyses of the data. Mean score of the
              participants from the ORTO-15 test is 39.8+/-0.22, and there is
              no statistical difference between women and men. A total of
              45.5\% of the residence MD involved in the research scored below
              40 in the ORTO-15 test. Those who do their food shopping
              themselves, skip a meal with a salad/fruit, care about the
              quality of the things they eat, think that eating outside is
              healthy, look at the content of what they eat and the content of
              food is important in selection of a product score lower in their
              average marks in ORTO-15 and the difference among the groups is
              statistically significant. Food selection of 20.1\% of the male
              participants and 38.9\% of the female participants among the
              residence MD is influenced by the programs on nutrition/health in
              mass-media. The difference between the groups is statistically
              significant (p<0.05). Female medical doctors are more careful
              than men of their physical appearance and weight control and
              consume less caloric food, which is statistically significant.
              Since those who exhibit ``healthy fanatic'' eating habits may
              have a risk of ON in the future, it would be useful to conduct
              studies that identify the prevalence of ON in the public.",

              psychotherapeutic interventions require culturally competent
              delivery for ethnoracial minority clients to protect the
              distinctive cultural orientations of these clients. Dominant
              disciplinary conceptualizations of cultural competence are ``kind
              of person'' models that emphasize specialized awareness,
              knowledge, and skills on the part of the practitioner. Even
              within psychology, this approach to cultural competence is
              controversial owing to professional misgivings concerning its
              culturally essentialist assumptions. Unfortunately, alternative
              ``process-oriented'' models of cultural competence emphasize such
              generic aspects of therapeutic interaction that they remain in
              danger of losing sight of culture altogether. Thus, for cultural
              competence to persist as a meaningful construct, an alternative
              approach that avoids both essentialism and generalism must be
              recovered. One means to capture this alternative is to shift
              focus away from culturally competent therapists toward culturally
              commensurate therapies. Indigenous communities in North America
              represent interesting sites for exploring this shift, owing to
              widespread political commitments to Aboriginal cultural
              reclamation in the context of postcoloniality. Two examples from
              indigenous communities illustrate a continuum of cultural
              commensurability that ranges from global psychotherapeutic
              approaches at one end to local healing traditions at the other.
              Location of culturally integrative efforts by indigenous
              communities along this continuum illustrates the possibility for
              local, agentic, and intentional deconstructions and

  abstract = "Participants in the sport of bodybuilding are judged by
              appearance rather than performance. In this respect, increased
              muscle size and definition are critical elements of success. The
              purpose of this review is to evaluate the literature and provide
              recommendations regarding macronutrient intake during both
              'off-season' and 'pre-contest' phases. Body builders attempt to
              increase muscle mass during the off-season (no competitive
              events), which may be the great majority of the year. During the
              off-season, it is advantageous for the bodybuilder to be in
              positive energy balance so that extra energy is available for
              muscle anabolism. Additionally, during the off-season, adequate
              protein must be available to provide amino acids for protein
              synthesis. For 6-12 weeks prior to competition, body builders
              attempt to retain muscle mass and reduce body fat to very low
              levels. During the pre-contest phase, the bodybuilder should be
              in negative energy balance so that body fat can be oxidised.
              Furthermore, during the pre-contest phase, protein intake must be
              adequate to maintain muscle mass. There is evidence that a
              relatively high protein intake (approximately 30\% of energy
              intake) will reduce lean mass loss relative to a lower protein
              intake (approximately 15\% of energy intake) during energy
              restriction. The higher protein intake will also provide a
              relatively large thermic effect that may aid in reducing body
              fat. In both the off-season and pre-contest phases, adequate
              dietary carbohydrate should be ingested (55-60\% of total energy
              intake) so that training intensity can be maintained. Excess
              dietary saturated fat can exacerbate coronary artery disease;
              however, low-fat diets result in a reduction in circulating
              testosterone. Thus, we suggest dietary fats comprise 15-20\% of
              the body builders' off-season and pre-contest diets. Consumption
              of protein/amino acids and carbohydrate immediately before and
              after training sessions may augment protein synthesis, muscle
              glycogen resynthesis and reduce protein degradation. The optimal
              rate of carbohydrate ingested immediately after a training
              session should be 1.2 g/kg/hour at 30-minute intervals for 4
              hours and the carbohydrate should be of high glycaemic index. In
              summary, the composition of diets for body builders should be
              55-60\% carbohydrate, 25-30\% protein and 15-20\% of fat, for
              both the off-season and pre-contest phases. During the off-season
              the diet should be slightly hyperenergetic (approximately 15\%
              increase in energy intake) and during the pre-contest phase the
              diet should be hypoenergetic (approximately 15\% decrease in
              energy intake).",

              orthorexia-related questions were administered to a group of 810
              Hungarian participants (89.4\% female) aged between 20 and 70 (M
              = 32.39 $\pm$ 10.37 years). RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis
              suggested a single factor structure for the 11-item shortened
              version of the instrument. Internal consistency of the measure
              was adequate (Cronbach's alpha = 0.82). No significant
              differences were found between males and females on the
              ORTO-11-Hu. Age and body mass index were significantly associated
              with a tendency towards orthorexia nervosa. Additional
              orthorexia-related features were significantly correlated with
              ORTO-11-Hu scores: orthorexia nervosa tendency was associated not
              only with healthier food choices (eating more whole wheat
              cereals, less white wheat cereals, more fruit and vegetables) but
              with shopping in health food stores, as well as with some healthy
              lifestyle habits (more sports activity, specific dietary
              behaviors, and less alcohol intake). Individuals with higher
              orthorexia nervosa tendency also reported a greater tendency to
              advocate their healthy diet to their friends and family members.
              CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence for the reliability
              of ORTO-11-Hu and some support for the construct validity of the
              instrument. The present study also contributes to the
              establishment of (diagnostic) criteria for this new subtype of
              eating disorders.",

  abstract = "Over 35 years of research suggests that endogenous hypothalamic
              serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) plays an important part in
              within-meal satiation and post-meal satiety processes. Thus, the
              serotonin system has provided a viable target for weight control,
              critical to the action of at least two effective anti-obesity
              treatments, both producing clinically significant weight loss
              over a year or more. Numerous serotonin receptor subtypes have
              been identified; of these, serotonin 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptors
              have been specifically recognised as mediators of
              serotonin-induced satiety.A number of serotonergic drugs,
              including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),
              dexfenfluramine and 5-HT2C receptor agonists, have been shown to
              significantly attenuate rodent bodyweight gain. This effect is
              strongly associated with marked hypophagia and is probably
              mediated by the hypothalamic melanocortin system. Additionally,
              sibutramine, dexfenfluramine, fluoxetine and the 5-HT2C receptor
              agonist chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) have all been shown to
              modify appetite in both lean and obese humans, resulting in
              reduced caloric intake. Clinical studies demonstrate serotonergic
              drugs specifically reduce appetite prior to and following the
              consumption of fixed caloric loads, and cause a reduction in
              pre-meal appetite and caloric intake at ad libitum meals. Weight
              loss in the obese has also been produced by treatment with both
              the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan and the preferential
              5-HT2C receptor agonist mCPP.A new generation of 5-HT2C receptor
              selective agonists have been developed and at least one,
              lorcaserin (APD356), is currently undergoing clinical trials. In
              addition, 5-HT6 receptor antagonists such as PRX-07034 and
              BVT74316 have been shown to potently reduce food intake and
              bodyweight gain in rodent models and have recently entered
              clinical trials. However, the role of the 5-HT6 receptor in the
              expression of appetite remains to be determined. The hope is that
              these drugs will not only be free of their predecessors' adverse
              effect profiles, but will also be equally or more effective at
              regulating appetite and controlling bodyweight.",

              capsule formulation of Adderall designed to produce a therapeutic
              effect that lasts throughout the day with 1 morning dose. The
              primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and
              safety of SLI381 compared with placebo in the treatment of
              attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children in a
              naturalistic school and home setting. A secondary objective was
              to assess the diurnal variation in responses based on morning and
              afternoon assessments. METHODS: A multicenter, randomized,
              double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial was
              conducted at 47 sites. After a 1-week washout of any previous
              stimulant medication, patients were randomized to receive
              single-daily morning doses of placebo or SLI381 10 mg, 20 mg, or
              30 mg for 3 weeks. Participants aged 6 to 12 years inclusive who
              satisfied Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
              Fourth Edition criteria diagnosis of ADHD were included. The
              primary efficacy parameter was the Conners Global Index Scale for
              Teachers. Secondary efficacy parameters included the Conners
              Global Index Scale for Parents, the Clinical Global Impressions
              Scale for improvement, and the Parent Global Assessment for
              improvement. Safety was assessed by recording adverse events,
              laboratory tests, and vital signs at each visit during the study.
              Physical examinations and electrocardiograms were performed at
              the screening and the end of the study. RESULTS: Five hundred
              eighty-four children were randomized, 563 were included in the
              intent-to-treat population, and 509 completed the entire study.
              Intention-to-treat analysis of Conners Global Index Scale for
              Teachers and Conners Global Index Scale for Parents scores
              revealed significant improvement in morning, afternoon, and late
              afternoon behavior for all active treatment groups versus
              placebo. All active treatment groups showed significant
              dose-related improvement in behavior from baseline. Both the
              Clinical Global Impressions Scale for improvement and Parent
              Global Assessment for improvement showed all doses of SLI381 to
              be superior to placebo at treatment end and both confirmed the
              dose-response relationship between improvement and the SLI381
              dose. The incidence of spontaneously reported adverse events was
              low and similar for active treatments and placebo. CONCLUSIONS:
              SLI381 produced consistent, dose-related improvements on all
              measures of efficacy. The extended-release nature of the SLI381
              formulation was shown by continued, significant improvement in
              afternoon assessments by teachers and afternoon and late
              afternoon assessments by parents. The time course and therapeutic
              effects of SLI381 suggests that this medication is an efficacious

              highlighting the role of pride in maintaining eating disordered
              behaviours. Despite its clinical importance, there are no
              measures to assess feelings of pride associated with eating
              psychopathology. This study describes the development and
              validation of the Pride in Eating Pathology Scale (PEP-S), a
              self-report questionnaire that examines feelings of pride towards
              eating disordered symptoms (e.g., pride in food restriction,
              thinness and weight loss). Participants were 390 females,
              recruited from university and community populations, whose mean
              age was 26.99 years. Respondents rated pride in eating pathology
              on a 7-point Likert-scale. Principal Component Analysis indicated
              that the 60-item scale comprised a four component structure: (1)
              pride in weight loss, food control and thinness, (2) pride in
              healthy weight and healthy eating, (3) pride in outperforming
              others and social recognition and (4) pride in capturing other
              people's attention due to extreme thinness. These four components
              explained a total of 65.31\% of the variance. The PEP-S
              demonstrated very good internal reliability ($\alpha$ ranging
              from 0.88 to 0.98) and very good test-retest reliability over a
              3-week time-span (r ranging from 0.81 to 0.93). The PEP-S also
              showed excellent convergent and discriminant validity.
              Furthermore, the scale discriminated between women with high and
              low levels of eating psychopathology. The PEP-S is a
              psychometrically robust measure of pride in eating pathology. It
              has the potential to advance theoretical understanding and may
              also be clinically useful. Copyright \copyright{} 2015 John Wiley

              reliable, quick and easy to administer self-report questionnaire
              that measures pride related to eating pathology. The PEP-S
              assesses four clinically relevant dimensions: (1) pride in weight
              loss, food control and thinness, (2) pride in healthy weight and
              healthy eating, (3) pride in outperforming others and social
              recognition and (4) pride in capturing other people's attention
              due to extreme thinness. The PEP-S has very good internal and
              test-retest reliability, and very good convergent and
              discriminant validity. The PEP-S distinguishes between women with
              higher and lower levels of eating psychopathology. The PEP-S
              makes an important contribution to understanding pride in eating

              syndrome that is precipitated by the use of serotonergic drugs
              and overactivation of both the peripheral and central
              postsynaptic 5HT-1A and, most notably, 5HT-2A receptors. This
              syndrome consists of a combination of mental status changes,
              neuromuscular hyperactivity, and autonomic hyperactivity.
              Serotonin syndrome can occur via the therapeutic use of
              serotonergic drugs alone, an intentional overdose of serotonergic
              drugs, or classically, as a result of a complex drug interaction
              between two serotonergic drugs that work by different mechanisms.
              A multitude of drug combinations can result in serotonin
              syndrome. METHODS: This review describes the presentation and
              management of serotonin syndrome and discusses the drugs and
              interactions that can precipitate this syndrome with the goal of
              making physicians more alert and aware of this potentially fatal
              yet preventable syndrome. CONCLUSION: Many commonly used
              medications have proven to be the culprits of serotonin syndrome.
              Proper education and awareness about serotonin syndrome will
              improve the accuracy of diagnosis and promote the institution of
              the appropriate treatment that may prevent significant morbidity
              and mortality.",

              these disorders. The study included 64 overweight postmenopausal
              women, aged 54 - 65 years, with increased appetite. They were
              randomly assigned in 2 groups. In group I (n = 30) fluoxetine (20
              mg in the morning) and placebo (in the evening) were administered
              for 24 weeks. Group II (n = 34) received fluoxetine (20 mg in the
              morning) and melatonin (5 mg in the evening) in the same period
              of time. Hamilton anxiety rating scale (HARS), Beck depression
              scale (BDI), the insomnia severity index (ISI) and body mass
              index (BMI) were used to assess the health status and the

              significant reduction in the level of anxiety and depression was
              obtained in both groups. In group I, the ISI decreased from 14.9

              published in peer-reviewed journals, empirical studies that
              considered Indigenous people's understandings of mental health
              and provided details on methodology. Five articles from four
              qualitative studies met these criteria. Meta-ethnography was used
              to identify common themes emerging from the original studies.
              Reciprocal translation was used to synthesize the findings to
              provide new interpretations extending beyond those presented in
              the original studies. An overarching theme emerged from the
              synthesis: the dynamic interconnectedness between the
              multi-factorial components of life circumstances. Reciprocal
              translations and synthesis regarding Indigenous understandings of
              mental health and illness resulted in five themes: (i) culture
              and spirituality; (ii) family and community kinships; (iii)
              historical, social and economic factors; (iv) fear and education;

              qualitative studies provided a deeper insight into Indigenous
              people's understandings of mental health and illness. The
              importance of understanding Indigenous descriptions and
              perceptions of mental health issues is crucial to enable two-way

              a prototypic pro-anorexia website, 235 female undergraduates were
              randomly assigned to view either the pro-anorexia website or one

              cognitions, and behavioral expectations were examined along with
              moderator effects. RESULTS: Study participants exposed to the
              pro-anorexia website had greater negative affect, lower social
              self-esteem, and lower appearance self-efficacy post-website than
              those who viewed a comparison website. Additionally, they
              perceived themselves as heavier, reported a greater likelihood of
              exercising and thinking about their weight in the near future,
              and engaged in more image comparison. Minimal support was found

              basis for concern (expressed by clinicians, researchers, the
              media) that pro-anorexia websites are a troubling new form of
              thin-ideal exposure that warrants further examination.",

              phenomenon that, if ignored, may facilitate OCD symptoms and lead
              to poorer prognosis. Because FA has been recognized as a
              predictor of treatment outcome, we examined the prevalence of FA
              and identified patient and family sociodemographic and clinical
              variables associated with FA in an outpatient sample. METHODS:
              The study comprised 228 subjects, namely, 114 patients with OCD
              and 114 family members, assessed before the patients entered a
              12-session cognitive behavioral group therapy program. A
              multivariate linear regression model was used to control for
              confounding factors and to evaluate variables independently

              Accommodation Scale for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder-Interviewer

              members. Two patient factors positively associated with FA were

              for the offspring, but their potential beneficial effects on

              of the first 600 APrON women. Supplemental nutrient intake and
              symptoms of depression (measured with the Edinburgh Postnatal
              Depression Scale (EPDS)) were collected at each trimester and 12
              weeks postpartum. RESULTS: Of the 475 participants who completed
              the EPDS at least twice in pregnancy and at 12 weeks postpartum,
              416 (88\%) scored <10 and 59 (12\%) scored $\geq$10, where an
              EPDS $\geq$10 is considered to be ``at least probable minor
              depression''. Mean nutrient intakes from supplements were higher
              in women with lower EPDS scores, particularly selenium (p =
              0.0015) and omega-3s (p = 0.01). Bivariate analyses showed that
              several demographic and social/lifestyle variables were
              associated with EPDS $\geq$10: not having been born in Canada (p
              = 0.01), greater number of chronic conditions (p = 0.05), greater
              number of stressful life events during this pregnancy (p = 0.02),
              and lower prenatal and postnatal support (p = 0.0043 and p =
              0.0001, respectively). Adjusting for covariates and nutrients
              known to be associated with postpartum depression, logistic
              regression showed that having a prenatal EPDS $\geq$ 10 increased
              the odds of postpartum depressive symptoms (second and third
              trimester OR = 3.29, 95\% CI = 1.55 - 7.01, p = 0.004 and OR =
              4.26, 95\% CI = 2.05 - 8.85, p < 0.0001, respectively), while
              prenatal supplemental selenium (per 10 mcg, OR = 0.76, 95\% CI =

              specified by this literature and to test the relationship of this
              new measure to various aspects of emotion regulation in a
              non-clinical sample of 289 participants. A factor analysis
              extracted six factors, which described beliefs about emotions as
              (a) overwhelming and uncontrollable; (b) shameful and irrational;
              (c) invalid and meaningless; (d) useless; (e) damaging; and (f)
              contagious. The final measure showed some promising psychometric
              properties. All of the questionnaire subscales were related to
              aspects of emotion dysregulation including distress, borderline
              personality disorder symptoms and behaviours associated with
              dysregulation of emotion, suggesting that beliefs about emotions
              could be an important metacognitive construct involved in the
              ability to regulate emotions. Beliefs about emotions may be a
              useful direct or indirect target for treatment of difficulties
              regulating emotions, and this could be achieved through the use
              of various therapeutic modalities.",

               conducted in private-practice psychiatric outpatient clinics.
               Following a 1-week, single-masked, placebo lead-in period,
               patients received bupropion SR for 8 weeks (study 1: 150 or 300

               100 to 300 mg/d). Safety assessments included monitoring adverse
               events, patient discontinuation rates, changes in weight, vital
               signs, and clinical laboratory test results. Across studies, the
               most frequently reported adverse events were headache, dry
               mouth, and nausea. The incidence of adverse events was similar
               (< or =5\% difference) between the bupropion SR and placebo
               groups, with the exception of dry mouth (bupropion SR, 16\%;
               placebo, 7\%). Dry mouth, nausea, and insomnia occurred
               significantly more often in bupropion SR-treated patients than
               in patients who received placebo (P<0.05). Nearly all (94\% to
               99\%) adverse events reported in these studies were mild or
               moderate. Less than 10\% of patients in either group

               and no deaths or serious drug-related adverse events were
               reported. Sexual dysfunction was reported as an adverse event by
               <1\% of patients in either group. Bupropion SR was associated
               with dose-related weight loss in all 3 studies. No consistent

              websites are a newer type of site that supposedly advocates a fit
              and healthy lifestyle. METHOD: The first 10 images from a sample
              of 50 Fitspiration and 50 Thinspiration websites, chosen using a
              standard internet search protocol, were rated on a variety of

              analyses were conducted to compare website content. RESULTS:
              Thinspiration sites featured more content related to losing
              weight or fat, praising thinness, showng a thin pose, and
              providing food guilt messages than Fitspiration sites. However,
              sites did not differ on guilt-inducing messages regarding weight

              health care providers use or are interested in using
              complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). People around the
              world rely on CAM, so similar issues face clinicians in many
              countries. In law, few cases have dealt with CAM use. The few
              that have apply the same general legal principles used in cases
              that involved conventional care while taking into account
              considerations unique to CAM. In ethics, as with conventional
              care, the issues surrounding pediatric CAM use usually involve
              questions about who the appropriate decision-makers are, on what
              ethical principles should clinical decision-making rely, and what
              obligations arise on the part of physicians and other health care
              providers. Clinical decision-making is made more complex by the
              relatively limited research on the efficacy and safety of CAM
              compared with conventional medicine, especially in children,
              which requires clinicians to make decisions under conditions of

              investigate the relationship of MD with childhood bullying
              victimization experiences and mental health problems in a
              nonclinical sample of male bodybuilders. Design A cross-sectional
              study was conducted with a sample of 100 male bodybuilders.
              Methods Participants completed a questionnaire battery consisting
              of the muscle dysmorphic inventory (MDI), and scales on childhood
              bullying victimization, self-esteem, and psychological problems
              including depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive (OC)
              symptoms. Results High scores on the MDI and bullying
              victimization in childhood predicted global psychopathology and
              low self-esteem. Psychological functioning and self-esteem were
              most strongly adversely affected if the men were victims of
              bullying and scored high on the MDI (significant moderation

              level that results in bodyweight losses of approximately 0.5 to
              1\%/wk to maximize muscle retention. Within this caloric intake,
              most but not all bodybuilders will respond best to consuming
              2.3-3.1 g/kg of lean body mass per day of protein, 15-30\% of
              calories from fat, and the reminder of calories from
              carbohydrate. Eating three to six meals per day with a meal
              containing 0.4-0.5 g/kg bodyweight of protein prior and
              subsequent to resistance training likely maximizes any
              theoretical benefits of nutrient timing and frequency. However,
              alterations in nutrient timing and frequency appear to have
              little effect on fat loss or lean mass retention. Among popular
              supplements, creatine monohydrate, caffeine and beta-alanine
              appear to have beneficial effects relevant to contest
              preparation, however others do not or warrant further study. The
              practice of dehydration and electrolyte manipulation in the final
              days and hours prior to competition can be dangerous, and may not
              improve appearance. Increasing carbohydrate intake at the end of
              preparation has a theoretical rationale to improve appearance,
              however it is understudied. Thus, if carbohydrate loading is
              pursued it should be practiced prior to competition and its
              benefit assessed individually. Finally, competitors should be
              aware of the increased risk of developing eating and body image
              disorders in aesthetic sport and therefore should have access to
              the appropriate mental health professionals.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In eating disorders (EDs), treatment outcome
              measurement has traditionally focused on symptom reduction rather
              than functioning or quality of life (QoL). The Eating Disorders
              Quality of Life Scale (EDQLS) was recently developed to allow for
              measurement of broader outcomes. We examined responsiveness of
              the EDQLS in a longitudinal multi-site study. METHODS: The EDQLS
              and comparator generic QoL scales were collected in person at
              baseline, and 3 and 6 months from 130 participants (mean age 25.6
              years; range 14-60) in 12 treatment programs in four Canadian
              provinces. Total score differences across the time points and
              responsiveness were examined using both anchor- and
              distribution-based methods. RESULTS: 98 (75\%) and 85 (65\%)
              responses were received at 3 and 6 months respectively. No
              statistically significant differences were found between the
              baseline sample and those lost to follow-up on any measured
              characteristic. Mean EDQLS total scores increased from 110 (SD =
              24) to 124.5 (SD = 29) at 3 months and 129 (SD = 28) at 6 months,
              and the difference by time was tested using a general linear
              model (GLM) to account for repeated measurement (p < .001).
              Responsiveness was good overall (Cohen's d = .61 and .80), and
              confirmed using anchor methods across 5 levels of self-reported
              improvement in health status (p < .001). Effect sizes across time
              were moderate or large for for all age groups. Internal
              consistency (Chronbach's alpha=.96) held across measurement
              points and patterns of responsiveness held across subscales.
              EDQLS responsiveness exceeded that of the Quality of Life
              Inventory, the Short Form-12 (mental and physical subscales) and
              was similar to the 16-dimension quality of life scale.
              CONCLUSIONS: The EDQLS is responsive to change in geographically
              diverse and clinically heterogeneous programs over a relatively
              short time period in adolescents and adults. It shows promise as
              an outcome measure for both research and clinical practice.",

              the challenges to the fundamental premises of Freud's
              psychoanalysis by those who have shifted to relationship or
              so-called two-person psychologies in our field. The author begins
              by briefly describing a parallel to the recent history of
              psychoanalysis in the sudden rise and fall of scholastic
              philosophy in the 14th century. He then focuses on contemporary
              attacks on Freud's psychoanalysis as a science, based on the
              contention by two-person psychologists that free association by
              the patient and evenly hovering attention by the analyst are
              actually impossible. He reviews Freud's idea of psychoanalysis,
              discusses psychodynamic psychotherapy, both conceived as
              scientific treatment procedures, and describes the current
              assault on their metapsychological and epistemological
              foundations. Returning to the parallel between what happened to
              medieval scholasticism and what has happened to psychoanalysis,
              he examines why this happened, and the resulting fragmentation of
              psychoanalytic practice. The article concludes with suggestions
              for the integration of various schools of psychoanalysis,
              reminding us of Benjamin Franklin's warning: ``We must, indeed,
              all hang together or, most assuredly, we shall all hang

  abstract  = "Although there is a voluminous literature on mass media effects
               on body image concerns of young adult women in the U.S., there
               has been relatively little theoretically-driven research on
               processes and effects of social media on young women's body
               image and self-perceptions. Yet given the heavy online presence
               of young adults, particularly women, and their reliance on
               social media, it is important to appreciate ways that social
               media can influence perceptions of body image and body image
               disturbance. Drawing on communication and social psychological
               theories, the present article articulates a series of ideas and
               a framework to guide research on social media effects on body
               image concerns of young adult women. The interactive format and
               content features of social media, such as the strong peer
               presence and exchange of a multitude of visual images, suggest
               that social media, working via negative social comparisons,
               transportation, and peer normative processes, can significantly
               influence body image concerns. A model is proposed that
               emphasizes the impact of predisposing individual vulnerability
               characteristics, social media uses, and mediating psychological
               processes on body dissatisfaction and eating disorders.
               Research-based ideas about social media effects on male body

              with other mental disorders including depression, suicidal
              behavior, and substance abuse. In an effort to elucidate the
              neurobiological underpinnings of impulsive aggression and to help
              account for its connections with these other disorders, this
              paper reviews relevant biochemical, brain imaging, and genetic
              studies. The review suggests that dysfunctional interactions
              between serotonin and dopamine systems in the prefrontal cortex
              may be an important mechanism underlying the link between
              impulsive aggression and its comorbid disorders. Specifically,
              serotonin hypofunction may represent a biochemical trait that
              predisposes individuals to impulsive aggression, with dopamine
              hyperfunction contributing in an additive fashion to the
              serotonergic deficit. The current paper proposes a modified
              diathesis-stress model of impulsive aggression in which the
              underlying biological diathesis may be deficient serotonergic
              function in the ventral prefrontal cortex. This underlying

              aggression towards oneself and others, and as depression under
              precipitating life stressors. Substance abuse associated with
              impulsive aggression is understood in the context of dopamine
              dysregulation resulting from serotonergic deficiency. Also

              influences on body image and eating disturbances-the
              Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire (SATAQ).
              METHOD: Two independent samples of college females completed a
              revision and extension of the SATAQ and factor analyses were
              conducted to determine the underlying structure of the revised
              scale. RESULTS: Factor analyses indicated two distinct
              internalization factors: one appeared to reflect a generic media
              influence related to TV, magazines, and movies. A second factor
              clearly reflected internalization of athletic and sports figures.
              Two other factors, reflecting media pressures and media as an
              informational source, also emerged. Another widely used measure
              of thin-ideal internalization, the Ideal Body Internalization
              Scale-Revised (IBIS-R), was included in factor analyses to
              determine its empirical relationship with the revised SATAQ. None
              of the IBIS-R items loaded with any of the internalization items
              or items reflective of media pressures or information. Instead,
              the IBIS-R appeared to tap into an awareness of appearance norms
              dimension. The SATAQ-3 subscales had excellent convergent
              validity with measures of body image and eating disturbance.
              Eating-disturbed and eating-disordered samples had higher scores
              on SATAQ-3 subscales than a control sample. DISCUSSION: The
              SATAQ-3 measures multiple aspects of a societal influence and

              gauging the efficacy of prevention and treatment programs.",

              tool exists. OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity and reliability of
              the HIS questionnaire. DESIGN: As no similar tool exists, we
              compared the HIS with three tools that reflect its key areas:
              physical impact (Pregnancy Unique Quantification of Emesis--PUQE
              score and markers of severity of HG), psychological impact
              (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score--HADS) and social impact
              (SF12 quality of life score). SETTING: A large regional referral,
              women and children's hospital in the North West of England.
              PARTICIPANTS: The HIS was evaluated on 50 women admitted to
              hospital with HG and 50 women recruited from ante-natal clinic
              without severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and with an
              uncomplicated pregnancy. RESULTS: Good criterion validity was
              demonstrated by strong significant correlations with all three
              scores (PUQE, r=0.75, p<0.001, HADS, depression r=0.76, p<0.001,

              internal consistency, Cronbach alpha 0.87, split half 0.80.
              CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence for the validity and reliability
              of the HIS to assess the impact of the physical and psychosocial
              symptoms of HG. Further research is currently underway to

  abstract  = "RATIONALE: The investigation of putative effects of early life
               stress (ELS) in humans on later behavior and neurobiology is a
               fast developing field. While epidemiological and neurobiological
               studies paint a somber picture of negative outcomes, relatively
               little attention has been devoted to integrating the breadth of
               findings concerning possible cognitive and emotional deficits
               associated with ELS. Emerging findings from longitudinal studies
               examining developmental trajectories of the brain in healthy
               samples may provide a new framework to understand mechanisms
               underlying ELS sequelae. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this review was
               twofold. The first was to summarize findings from longitudinal
               data on normative brain development. The second was to utilize
               this framework of normative brain development to interpret
               changes in developmental trajectories associated with deficits
               in cognitive and affective function following ELS. RESULTS: Five
               principles of normative brain development were identified and
               used to discuss behavioral and neural sequelae of ELS. Early
               adversity was found to be associated with deficits in a range of
               cognitive (cognitive performance, memory, and executive
               functioning) and affective (reward processing, processing of
               social and affective stimuli, and emotion regulation) functions.
               CONCLUSION: Three general conclusions emerge: (1) higher-order,
               complex cognitive and affective functions associated with brain
               regions undergoing protracted postnatal development are
               particularly vulnerable to the deleterious effects of ELS; (2)
               the amygdala is particularly sensitive to early ELS; and (3)
               several deficits, particularly those in the affective domain,
               appear to persist years after ELS has ceased and may increase
               risk for later psychopathology.",

              orexis--appetite, desire) is a term introduced in 1997 by the
              American doctor Steven Bratman and is defined as a pathological
              fixation with righteous and healthy eating. Clear classification
              criteria oforthorexia have not been developed yet and there has
              been an on-going discussion whether it belongs to the group of
              eating disorders or the obsessive-compulsive disorders. AIM: The
              aim of this paper is to summarise briefly the current state of
              knowledge regarding orthorexia and to point out the difficulties
              connected with an attempt to classify it in a given disorders
              group as well as with the attempt to establish the classification
              criteria. DISCUSSION: Despite the fact that the problem of
              orthorexia has been signalled in the Polish media, it has neither
              been discussed nor published in the Polish medical literature
              yet. Orthorexia starts when a diet becomes an escape from
              life--everyday activities are dominated by planning, buying and
              preparing ``proper'' meals. Each departure from this regime
              causes anxiety and guilty conscience and leads to even further
              tightening of the dietary habits. According to Bratmann,
              orthorexia is connected with an illusory feeling of safety
              (preventing from diseases), the urge to exercise a full control
              over one's life (elimination of the unpredictable), ``a hidden
              conformism'' (eating philosophy helps in a subconscious way to
              achieve a culturally accepted model of a beautiful body), a
              search for spirituality and identity, and a desire for
              self-deprivation. CONCLUSIONS: The arguments presented in this
              paper substantiate the expediency of implementing the
              epidemiological studies which will show the scale of the problem,
              its prevalence and conditionings. Data obtained in this way
              should facilitate the verification of classification criteria and
              will also help to formulate the diagnostic criteria of
              orthorexia.",

  abstract  = "Background: Orthorexia nervosa is the pathological obsession for
               consuming only biologically pure food that may lead to the
               development of specific ritualistic attitudes towards food
               preparation and the restriction of specific food groups that can
               be harmful to one's health (Zamora et al., 2005; Matera, 2012).
               Aim: Due to the rise in popularity with Instagram and online
               eating disorder communities, and the potential negative outcomes
               on psychosocial health, the purpose of this descriptive study
               was to investigate images tagged with \#orthorexia on Instagram
               over 7 days. Methods: A mixed methods approach was utilized for
               this study. A text analysis was conducted using the Netlytic
               program (Gruzd, 2016) to explore for emerging themes of
               discussion specifically using word count frequency, and a
               network analysis using both a name network (i.e., who mentions
               whom) and a chain network (i.e., who replies to whom) was
               performed. Among a subsample of images, author/image information
               was manually obtained, and a coding scheme (adapted from
               Tiggemann and Zaccardo, 2016) was implemented for a subsample of
               images (results pending). Results: Among the 4,533 records
               downloaded, there were 48,780 unique words associated with the
               posts (in the description of the picture or in the comment
               section). Majority of most commonly used words were associated
               with eating disorder recovery (i.e., 425 instances of
               \#edrecovery; 340 instances of \#recovery; 297 instances of
               \#eatingdisorderrecovery). The chain network/direct interactions
               analysis indicated a large online presence with 1,503 nodes
               (i.e., users) and 1,803 ties (i.e., direct replies between
               users). The coding of \#orthorexia images is pending but will
               help us further understand the orthorexia online community.
               Conclusions: As the network analysis and text analysis suggested
               an eating disorder recovery theme, this suggests that Instagram
               may be being used as a supportive and interactive community for
               those who have/had symptoms of orthorexia.",

  abstract = "Weight-control behaviour is commonly observed in a wide range of
              elite sports, especially leanness sports, where control over body
              weight is crucial for high peak performance. Nonetheless, there
              is only a fine line between purely functional behaviour and
              clinically relevant eating disorders. Especially the rapid form
              of weight manipulation seems to foster later eating disorders. So
              far, most studies have focussed on adult athletes and
              concentrated on manifest eating disorders. In contrast, our
              review concentrates on young athletes and weight-control
              behaviour as a risk factor for eating disorders. An electronic
              search according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for
              Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) Statement was performed
              using Pubmed, PsychInfo and Spolit. The following search terms
              were used: weight-control, weight-control behaviour, weight gain,
              weight loss, pathogenic weight-control behaviour and
              weight-concerns, each of them combined with elite athlete, young
              elite athlete, adolescent elite athlete and elite sports.
              Overall, data are inconsistent. In general, athletes do not seem
              to be at a higher risk for pathogenic weight concerns and
              weight-control behaviour. It does seem to be more prevalent in
              leanness sports, though. There is evidence for pathogenic
              weight-control behaviour in both genders; male athletes mostly
              trying to gain weight whereas females emphasise weight reduction.
              There is not enough data to make predictions about connections
              with age of onset. Young elite athletes do show weight-control
              behaviour with varying degrees of frequency and severity. In
              particular, leanness sports seem to be a risk factor for weight
              manipulation. Further research is needed for more details and

              anorexia has been well established, little is known about the
              social consequences of ``clean dieting'' and orthorexia nervosa.
              In two studies, we examined the social stigma of clean dieting
              and orthorexia. METHOD: In Study 1, participants read a vignette
              describing a woman following a ``clean'' diet, a woman with
              anorexia, or a control target (minimal information about the
              individual). In Study 2, participants read a vignette describing
              a woman with orthorexia, a woman displaying identical orthorexic
              behaviors but without the orthorexia label, a woman with
              anorexia, or a control target. Participants then rated the target
              individual on a range of measures assessing stereotypes,
              emotions, and behavioral intentions toward the target. RESULTS:
              Study 1 found that the clean-dieting target was evaluated more
              negatively than the control target on some dimensions, but less
              negatively than the target with anorexia nervosa. Study 2 found
              that evaluations of the targets with orthorexia nervosa were more
              negative than evaluations of a control target, but did not differ
              from evaluations of the target with anorexia nervosa. Perceptions
              of the target's control over her behavior were associated with
              more positive evaluations (Studies 1 and 2), whereas perceptions
              of blame and responsibility for the condition were associated
              with more negative evaluations (Study 2). CONCLUSIONS: Overall,
              these findings highlight the potential negative social
              consequences of clean dieting and orthorexia nervosa, and point
              to perceptions of control and blame as potential mechanisms
              underlying the stigma of these conditions.",

              favorable adverse-event profile compared with tricyclic
              antidepressants (TCAs). OBJECTIVES: The present meta-analysis
              sought to provide a reanalysis of updated adverse-event and
              discontinuation data for fluoxetine 20 to 80 mg/d compared with
              TCAs and placebo in the treatment of major depressive disorder
              (MDD) in adults. A subanalysis to assess the safety profile of
              the most commonly used effective dose of fluoxetine in MDD (20
              mg) was also conducted. METHODS: Data were obtained from 25
              double-blind clinical trials involving 4016 patients with MDD
              randomized to treatment with fluoxetine 20 to 80 mg/d, TCAs, or
              placebo. The subanalysis included data from 6 trials involving
              1258 patients treated with fixed 20-mg doses of fluoxetine or
              placebo. Spontaneously reported treatment-emergent adverse
              events, reasons for discontinuation, and events leading to
              discontinuation were compared between groups. RESULTS: The age of
              the 4016 randomized patients ranged from 12 to 90 years, with a
              mean age of 46 years. Most patients were white (92\%), and 62\%
              were female. The age of the 1258 patients in the 20-mg fixed-dose
              population ranged from 18 to 90 years, with a mean age of 54
              years; as in the total population, most of these patients were
              white (92\%), and 57\% were female. The adverse-event profiles of
              fluoxetine and TCAs in these trials were consistent with the
              typical profiles of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and
              TCAs. At a dose of 20 mg/d, fluoxetine-treated patients had a
              discontinuation rate due to adverse events that was not
              statistically significantly different from that in placebo
              recipients. Discontinuation rates due to lack of efficacy were
              not significantly different between fluoxetine and TCAs. However,
              significantly more TCA-treated patients discontinued therapy
              because of adverse events and significantly fewer completed
              treatment compared with fluoxetine-treated patients (both, P or =
              2\%) leading to discontinuation were asthenia, dizziness,
              insomnia, nausea, nervousness, somnolence, and tremor in
              fluoxetine-treated patients and abnormal vision, agitation,
              constipation, dizziness, dry mouth, headache, nausea,
              nervousness, rash, somnolence, sweating, and tremor in
              TCA-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this large series of
              clinical trials confirm that fluoxetine is well tolerated in the
              acute treatment of MDD in adults, especially at a dosage of 20
              mg/d, and is better tolerated than the recommended doses of TCAs.",

              given drug may affect one or more sites over its clinically
              relevant dosing range and may produce multiple and different
              clinical effects. The enhanced safety profile includes a reduced
              likelihood of pharmacodynamically mediated adverse drug-drug
              interactions by avoiding affects on sites that are not essential
              to the intended outcome. SSRIs were developed for inhibition of
              the neuronal uptake pump for serotonin (5-HT), a property shared
              with the TCAs, but without affecting the other various
              neuroreceptors or fast sodium channels. The therapeutic mechanism
              of action of SSRIs involves alteration in the 5-HT system. The
              plethora of biological substrates, receptors and pathways for
              5-HT are candidates to mediate not only the therapeutic actions
              of SSRIs, but also their side effects. A hypothesis to explain
              these immediate side effects is that 5-HT is increased at
              specific 5-HT receptor subtypes in discrete regions of the body
              where the relevant physiologic processes are regulated. Marked
              differences exist between the SSRIs with regard to effects on
              specific cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, and thus the likelihood
              of clinically important pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions.
              Although no clear relationship exists between the clinical
              efficacy, plasma concentration of SSRIs, nor any threshold that
              defines toxic concentrations, but therapeutic drug monitoring
              (TDM) may be useful in special populations, such as in elderly
              patients, poor metabolizers (PM) of sparteine (CYP2D6) or
              mephenytoin (CYP2C19), and patients with liver and kidney
              impairment. Several meta-analyses have reviewed the comparative
              efficacy of TCAs and SSRIs, and concluded that both TCAs and
              SSRIs have similar efficacy in the treatment of depression. SSRIs
              have demonstrated better efficacy and tolerability in the
              treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). They have also
              been found to be effective in the treatment for social anxiety
              disorder both in reducing total levels of social anxiety and in
              improving overall clinical condition. The benefit of SSRIs in
              anorexia nervosa (AN) is apparently short-term unless medication
              is given in the context of nutritional or behavioral therapy. No
              single antidepressant can ever be recommended for every patient,
              but in a vast majority of patients, SSRIs should be considered as
              one of the first-line drugs in the treatment of depression.",

              Roberts, Delia",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Nutrition is often a casualty of the busy work day
              for physicians. We aimed to explore physicians' views of their
              nutrition in the workplace including their perceptions of the
              impact of inadequate nutrition upon their personal wellness and
              their professional performance. METHODS: This is a qualitative
              study of a sample of 20 physicians practicing in a large urban
              teaching hospital. Semi-structured open ended interviews were
              conducted to explore physicians' views of workplace nutrition.
              The same physicians had agreed to participate in a related
              nutrition based wellness intervention study that compared
              nutritional intake and cognitive function during a day of usual
              nutrition patterns against another day with scheduled nutrition
              breaks. A second set of interviews was conducted after the
              intervention study to explore how participation in the
              intervention impacted these views. Detailed interview content
              notes were transcribed and analyzed independently with
              differences reconciled by discussion. RESULTS: At initial
              interview, participants reported difficulty accessing adequate
              nutrition at work, linking this deficit with emotional (irritable
              and frustrated), physical (tired and hungry), and cognitive
              (difficulty concentrating and poor decision making) symptoms. In
              addition to identifying practical barriers such as lack of time
              to stop and eat, inconvenient access to food and poor food
              choices, the physicians described how their sense of
              professionalism and work ethic also hinder their work nutrition
              practices. After participating in the intervention, most
              physicians reported heightened awareness of their nutrition
              patterns and intentions to improve their workplace nutrition.
              CONCLUSIONS: Physicians report that inadequate workplace
              nutrition has a significant negative impact on their personal
              wellness and professional performance. Given this threat to
              health care delivery, health care organizations and the medical
              profession need to address both the practical and professional
              barriers identified.",

              to offer in the prevention of eating disorders and child obesity.
              Our paper notes the important contribution of school educators
              whilst warning of the current need to specifically examine how
              teachers and school personnel may be best trained and prepared
              for such a preventive role, whether they currently feel willing
              and able to undertake such a role, and whether some groups of
              teachers may be personally susceptible to body image and eating
              problems. It is vital to understand the knowledge, behaviors,
              attitudes, and expectations of educators implementing prevention
              programs in order to ensure that they are personally and
              professionally capable of carrying out prevention initiatives in

               therapy (CBT) because it describes and explains clients'
               presentations in ways that inform interventions. Yet the
               evidence base challenges the claimed benefits of case
               conceptualization. This paper reviews the rationale and evidence
               base for case conceptualization and outlines a new approach that
               uses the metaphor of a case conceptualization crucible in which
               a client's particular history, experience and strengths are
               synthesized with theory and research to produce an original and
               unique account of clients' presenting issues. The crucible
               metaphor illustrates three key defining principles of case
               conceptualization. First, heat drives chemical reactions in a
               crucible. In our model, collaborative empiricism between
               therapist and client provides the heat. Second, like the
               chemical reaction in a crucible, conceptualization develops over
               time. Typically, it begins at more descriptive levels, later a
               conceptualization incorporates explanatory elements and, if
               necessary, it develops further to include a longitudinal
               explanation of how pre-disposing and protective factors
               influence client issues. Finally, new substances formed in a
               crucible are dependent on the chemical characteristics of the
               materials put into it. Rather than simply look at client
               problems, our model incorporates client strengths at every stage
               of the conceptualization process to more effectively alleviate
               client distress and promote resilience.",

              notoriously difficult. Traditional drug development fails to
              exploit knowledge of the psychological factors that crucially
              influence appetite, concentrating instead on restrictive criteria
              of intake and weight reduction, allied to a mechanistic view of
              energy regulation. Drugs are under development that may produce
              beneficial changes in appetite expression in the obese. These
              currently include glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs such as
              liraglutide, an amylin analog davalintide, the 5-HT(2C) receptor
              agonist lorcaserin, the monoamine re-uptake inhibitor
              tesofensine, and a number of combination therapies such as
              pramlintide and metreleptin, bupropion and naltrexone,
              phentermine and topiramate, and bupropion and zonisamide.
              However, the effects of these treatments on eating behavior
              remain poorly characterized. Obesity is typically a consequence
              of overconsumption driven by an individual's natural sensitivity
              to food stimuli and the pleasure derived from eating.
              Intuitively, these processes should be effective targets for
              pharmacotherapy, and behavioral analysis can identify drugs that
              selectively affect desire to eat, enjoyment of eating, satiation
              or postmeal satiety. Rational interventions designed specifically
              to modulate these processes could limit the normally aversive
              consequences of caloric restriction and maximize an individual's

              rated audiotapes of therapy sessions using the working alliance
              inventory-observer version (WAI-o). Patients' characteristics
              examined to predict the development of the therapeutic alliance
              included their socioeconomic characteristics, markers of eating
              disorder psychopathology and expectancy of their treatment.
              Baseline scores on the eating disorder examination (EDE) were
              positively correlated with the alliance early in treatment in FBT
              but no patients' characteristics were correlated with the
              alliance in AFT. EDE was a moderator of alliance, with higher
              baseline EDE scores predicting higher alliance scores in the FBT
              group than in the AFT group. The results suggest that the

              therapeutic alliance. Clinical strategies hypothesized to promote
              a strong therapeutic alliance include the externalization of AN,

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: A pattern of disordered eating involving a
               pathological fixation with healthy food consumption, labeled
               orthorexia nervosa (ON), has recently generated attention;
               however, research has not yet investigated perceptions of
               ON-related behaviors. This study examined potential
               stigmatization of ON, compared with DSM-5 ED diagnoses. METHOD:
               Participants (N = 505) were randomly assigned to read a vignette
               depicting a woman with anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa
               (BN), binge-eating disorder (BED), or ON. They then answered
               questions about the individual depicted in the vignette. A
               series of MANOVAs investigated whether opinions and beliefs
               about the person depicted varied as a function of the disorder
               described in the vignette. RESULTS: Individuals with ON were
               perceived as less likely to ``improve with treatment'' than
               individuals with BN, and less likely to ``pull themselves
               together,'' than individuals with BED. Individuals with ON and
               AN were viewed as ``hard[er] to talk to'' and more of a ``danger
               to others'' compared with individuals with BED. ON was viewed as
               less distressing, less likely to evoke sympathy, and more
               acceptable than the other disorders. Finally, ``poor living
               choices'' were perceived as contributing more substantially to
               ON. Participants' attributions of various personality
               characteristics did not differ based on ED diagnosis.
               DISCUSSION: Results suggest that ON is viewed as less severe,
               more desirable, and more often the result of personal life
               choices. However, findings also imply that ON is associated with
               stigma, similar to DSM-5 EDs. These negative attitudes might
               reinforce ON behaviors, and limit awareness of their potential
               complications.",

               hoarding. Fifty-two individuals with self-reported hoarding
               problems and their close significant others (CSOs) completed the
               Family Accommodation Interview for Hoarding (FAI-H), which was
               adapted from a previously validated measure for this study, and
               a series of self-report questionnaires. The FAI-H was found to
               be a reliable and valid measure of accommodation in problem
               hoarding. CSOs who lived with the individual with the hoarding
               problem reported engaging in accommodating behaviors more
               frequently than those who did not live with the individual.
               Accommodation was positively associated with hoarding symptom
               severity, relationship functioning, and CSOs' rejecting
               attitudes toward the individual with hoarding problems, and it
               partially mediated the association between hoarding symptom

               simply wish to develop some skills in circular interviewing. The

               model has two categories of questions: those that draw
               connections and thus broaden a client's understanding of their
               context and those that draw distinctions and thus narrow a
               client's focus where generalisations predominate. The model is

              behavior, metabolism and body weight. To examine possible
              interactions between 5-HT and neuropeptides in appetite control,
              fenfluramine (200 nmol/0.5 $\mu$l/side) was administered directly

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Previous research suggests that hoarding aggregates
               in families and is associated with health and safety risks and
               family problems. The present study examined gender- and
               diagnosis-related differences in reports of hoarding symptoms
               among first-degree relatives of people who hoard, and of
               clinical and community samples. METHODS: The present study
               included 443 participants in a study of hoarding behavior: 217
               with hoarding disorder (HD), 96 with obsessive-compulsive
               disorder (OCD), and 130 nonclinical community controls (CC).
               Assessment included a detailed interview of familial patterns of
               hoarding behaviors among parents and siblings and measures of
               hoarding severity. RESULTS: In the combined sample, participants
               reported more hoarding among female (mothers, sisters) than male
               (fathers, brothers) relatives. Significantly more female than
               male participants indicated they had a parent or any
               first-degree relative with hoarding behaviors. However, within
               the HD sample no significant gender effects were found for
               household, safety, and functioning variables, or for hoarding
               symptom severity. In an age- and gender-matched subsample (total
               n = 150), HD participants reported more hallmark hoarding
               symptoms (difficulty discarding and saving/clutter), and
               acquiring among their relatives compared to OCD and CC samples,
               and parents had higher rates than siblings. CONCLUSIONS:
               Hoarding symptoms appear to be common among first-degree
               relatives of people who hoard and are also found among relatives
               of control samples. The predominance of hoarding symptoms among
               female relatives may indicate genetic or modeling transmission
               but this requires further study using large twin samples.
               Clinicians should consider that family members may also have
               significant hoarding symptoms.",

  abstract  = "In summary, fluoxetine is a highly selective serotonin uptake
               inhibitor in vitro and in vivo. The conformation of fluoxetine,
               which resembles that of sertraline and other serotonin uptake
               inhibitors, appears to be a key feature that enables its high
               affinity and selective interaction with the serotonin
               transporter. The para-trifluoromethyl substituent, however, is
               also a pivotal structural element. The molecular pharmacology of
               fluoxetine has been well-defined, and its in vivo
               pharmacological effects appear to be mediated almost exclusively
               by serotonin uptake inhibition. Its selectivity for the
               serotonin transporter, lack of affinity for neurotransmitter
               receptors, and retention of selectivity following metabolism to
               norfluoxetine make fluoxetine a useful tool to explore
               pharmacologically induced increases in serotonin
               neurotransmission. Fluoxetine has found a variety of therapeutic
               application. Its use in treating depression has been most
               extensively studied, but controlled clinical studies also
               suggest the drug may have a role in treating obesity and
               bulimia. Moreover, a variety of other psychiatric disorders may
               be treatable with this drug. Regardless of the outcome of these
               clinical trials, it is apparent that fluoxetine has found a
               useful niche in therapy, and can be used as a probe to determine
               the role of serotonin in modulating human pathophysiologies.",

              benzodiazepines established as an additional, quickly growing
              compound class among the new psychoactive substances. Data
              regarding pharmacokinetic parameters, metabolism and
              detectability for new compounds is limited or often not
              available. One of these compounds, flubromazolam
              (8-bromo-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]benzodiazepine;
              the triazolo-analogue of flubromazepam), has been offered on the
              Internet from 2014 on. The purpose of the present study was to
              assess the time frame of detectability in biological samples
              along with preliminary basic pharmacokinetic parameters of the
              designer benzodiazepine flubromazolam. To investigate these one
              of the authors ingested a capsule containing 0.5 mg of the drug.
              Metabolism studies and suitability tests for the detection with
              immunochemical assays where performed with the samples obtained
              from the self-experiment and 5 authentic case samples.
              Flubromazolam and its' mono-hydroxylated metabolite were
              detectable by LC-MS/MS in urine for up to 6.5 and 8 days,
              respectively (LLOQ flubromazolam: 0.1 ng/ml). Peak serum
              concentrations were as low as 8 ng/ml (8 h post ingestion).
              Glucuronides were also detected. The terminal elimination
              half-life could be estimated in the range of 10-20 h.
              Immunochemical assays yielded negative results for serum samples
              and positive results for urine samples for up to five days post
              ingestion. The presented data demonstrates the detectability of a
              single uptake of 0.5 mg of flubromazolam in hair samples
              collected two weeks after drug uptake by LC-MS3 (cmax 0.6 pg/mg;

               healthful eating. The aim of this study was to investigate
               whether there is any difference in orthorexic behaviours between
               clinical and non-clinical groups, and in different cultural
               contexts. . METHODS: Recruitment involved both female patients
               with anorexia nervosa (AN) and healthy controls (HC) from Italy
               and Poland (N = 23 and N = 35 AN patients; and N = 39 and N = 39
               HCs, in Italy and Poland, respectively). Assessment of
               orthorexic behaviours was performed with the ORTO-15 test.
               RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found
               between Italian women in the AN and HC group, whereas no
               difference between Polish women in the AN and HC group was
               found. Both Italian groups scored significantly higher than the
               Polish ones on the ORTO-15. CONCLUSIONS: Differences have been
               found between the Italian and Polish samples, both in the
               percentage of individuals with orthorexic behaviours as
               suggested by an ORTO 15 score below the cutoff, and in the mean

              intake, may interact to control energy homoeostasis. We therefore
              investigated the effects of fluoxetine, which inhibits serotonin
              reuptake, on food intake and the activity of the neuropeptide
              Yergic arcuato-paraventricular projection in lean Wistar and
              Zucker rats. We also studied its effects in obese Zucker rats, in
              which obesity is postulated to be due to overactivity of the
              arcuato-paraventricular projection. Fluoxetine significantly
              reduced food intake in lean and obese rats, both during
              continuous subcutaneous infusion and (10 mg/kg/day for seven
              days) and acutely after a single injection (10 mg/kg). Fluoxetine
              also significantly reduced neuropeptide Y levels in the
              paraventricular nucleus, a major site of neuropeptide Y release
              which is highly sensitive to the appetite-stimulating actions of
              neuropeptide Y. Push-pull sampling in lean and fatty Zucker rats
              showed that neuropeptide Y secretion in the paraventricular
              nucleus was significantly reduced after acute fluoxetine
              treatment. Furthermore, seven days fluoxetine treatment prevented
              the significant increases in hypothalamic neuropeptide Y
              messenger RNA which were induced in lean rats by food restriction
              which precisely matched the hypophagia induced by the drug. We
              conclude that fluoxetine inhibits various aspects of the activity
              of the neuropeptide Yergic arcuato-paraventricular neurons, and
              suggest that reduced neuropeptide Y release in the
              paraventricular nucleus may mediate, at least in part, the drug's
              hypophagic action. We further suggest that serotonin may
              influence food intake and energy balance by inhibiting the
              arcuato-paraventricular projection, and that the two
              neurotransmitters may act together to regulate feeding and energy

              located in the 5' region of the gene (5'F7), an intronic mutation
              (IVS7), and the 353Arg-Gln polymorphism. All the polymorphisms,
              which showed strong allelic association, analyzed separately or
              in combination by the one-way analysis of variance, were
              associated with significantly different FVII levels. The 5'F7 and
              353Arg-Gln polymorphic systems, which have very similar allele
              frequencies, contributed to a similar extent to the total
              phenotypic variance, whereas the contribution of the IVS7
              polymorphism was lower. Genetic variation at the FVII locus,
              evaluated on combined genotypes, accounted for up to 40\% of the
              phenotype FVII variance. As also shown by the two-way analysis of
              variance, the use of two out of three markers is advisable, and
              since the 5'F7 polymorphism can be screened by a simple
              immunoassay, it should be preferred for population-based studies.
              No substantial differences between FVII activity and FVII antigen
              levels were found, thus suggesting that the variation was due to
              biosynthesis- or stability-mediated mechanisms. The genetic
              control of FVII levels described in this study plays an important
              role in determining plasma FVII level variability, which may

              greater scrutiny than with anorectics. After the approval in the
              1940s and 1950s of a number of amphetamine and amphetamine-like
              compounds for the treatment of obesity, the U.S. Food and Drug
              Administration struggled to define the efficacy and safety of
              these agents. Labeling restrictions on duration of use and
              warnings about abuse and addiction ultimately contributed to the

              were drawn from the Saskatchewan Ministry of Health
              administrative data files in outpatient settings. The data were
              for 9 triennial years from 1983 to 2007, a 24-year period, for
              those aged 0 to 19 in the general population. Descriptive
              analyses were used. RESULTS: In 1983, 5.9 per 1000 population
              aged 0 to 19 were dispensed at least 1 AD; this decreased to 5.1
              per 1000 population in 1989, and then increased to 15.4 per 1000
              population in 2007, with a slower increase after 2004. Both sexes
              were dispensed more ADs from 1989 onwards, with females being the
              heavier users. The rate of AD use increased significantly with
              age, and this trend became more pronounced after 1998. Family
              physicians were the major prescribers and their prescriptions
              significantly increased from 1989 to 2004 and decreased in 2007.
              The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was
              the major reason for the increase. The number of AD scripts per

              of AD use among children and youth was largely caused by the use
              of SSRIs. The possibility of safety issues induced by AD use
              among children and adolescents, and different patterns of

               Such specification of outcome-relevant aspects of practice is
               vital to theory development and can inform both treatment
               delivery and clinical training. An emergent theory of MI is

               spirit of MI, and a technical component involving the
               differential evocation and reinforcement of client change talk.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Appearance comparison has consistently been shown to
              engender body image dissatisfaction. To date, most studies have
              demonstrated this relationship between appearance comparison and
              body image dissatisfaction in the context of conventional media
              images depicting the thin-ideal. Social comparison theory posits
              that people are more likely to compare themselves to similar
              others. Since social media forums such as Facebook involve one's
              peers, the current study aimed to determine whether the
              relationship between appearance comparison and body image
              dissatisfaction would be stronger for those exposed to social
              media images, compared to conventional media images. METHODS: A
              sample of 193 female first year university students were randomly
              allocated to view a series of either Facebook or conventional
              media thin-ideal images. Participants completed questionnaires
              assessing pre- and post- image exposure measures of thin-ideal
              internalisation, appearance comparison, self-esteem, Facebook use
              and eating disorder risk. RESULTS: Type of exposure was not found
              to moderate the relationship between appearance comparison and
              changes in body image dissatisfaction. When analysed according to
              exposure type, appearance comparison only significantly predicted
              body image dissatisfaction change for those exposed to Facebook,
              but not conventional media. Facebook use was found to predict
              higher baseline body image dissatisfaction and was associated
              with higher eating disorder risk. CONCLUSIONS: The findings
              suggest the importance of extending the body image
              dissatisfaction literature by taking into account emerging social
              media formats. It is recommended that interventions for body
              image dissatisfaction and eating disorders consider appearance
              comparison processes elicited by thin-ideal content on social
              media forums, such as Facebook, in addition to conventional

              Amadumbe SNCs exhibited square-like platelets morphology, typical

              dynamics of its causative agent-severe acute respiratory syndrome
              coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)- in Wuhan (China), where vigorous
              non-pharmaceutical interventions have suppressed the local
              outbreak of this disease1. Here we use a modelling approach to
              reconstruct the full-spectrum dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan
              between 1 January and 8 March 2020 across 5 periods defined by
              events and interventions, on the basis of 32,583
              laboratory-confirmed cases1. Accounting for presymptomatic
              infectiousness2, time-varying ascertainment rates, transmission
              rates and population movements3, we identify two key features of
              the outbreak: high covertness and high transmissibility. We
              estimate 87\% (lower bound, 53\%) of the infections before 8
              March 2020 were unascertained (potentially including asymptomatic
              and mildly symptomatic individuals); and a basic reproduction
              number (R0) of 3.54 (95\% credible interval 3.40-3.67) in the
              early outbreak, much higher than that of severe acute respiratory
              syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)4,5.
              We observe that multipronged interventions had considerable
              positive effects on controlling the outbreak, decreasing the
              reproduction number to 0.28 (95\% credible interval 0.23-0.33)
              and-by projection-reducing the total infections in Wuhan by
              96.0\% as of 8 March 2020. We also explore the probability of
              resurgence following the lifting of all interventions after 14
              consecutive days of no ascertained infections; we estimate this
              probability at 0.32 and 0.06 on the basis of models with 87\% and
              53\% unascertained cases, respectively-highlighting the risk
              posed by substantial covert infections under changing control
              measures. These results have important implications when
              considering strategies of continuing surveillance and

              memory T cells in humans with the potential to recognize
              SARS-CoV-2. Here, we first studied T cell responses to structural

              ORF1) regions of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 convalescents (n=36). In
              all of them we demonstrated the presence of CD4 and CD8 T cells
              recognizing multiple regions of the NP protein. We then showed
              that SARS-recovered patients (n=23) still possess long-lasting
              memory T cells reactive to SARS-NP 17 years after the 2003
              outbreak, which displayed robust cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2
              NP. Surprisingly, we also frequently detected SARS-CoV-2 specific
              T cells in individuals with no history of SARS, COVID-19 or
              contact with SARS/COVID-19 patients (n=37). SARS-CoV-2 T cells in
              uninfected donors exhibited a different pattern of
              immunodominance, frequently targeting the ORF-1-coded proteins
              NSP7 and 13 as well as the NP structural protein. Epitope
              characterization of NSP7-specific T cells showed recognition of
              protein fragments with low homology to ``common cold'' human
              coronaviruses but conserved amongst animal betacoranaviruses.

                  pregnant women using real-time PCR and primers and probes
                  targeted toward exon 7 and 10 of RHD gene. Methods: We
                  analysed 24 RhD-negative pregnant woman and 4 patients with
                  weak D phenotypes at a gestational age ranging from 11th to
                  38th week of gestation and correlated the results with
                  serological analysis of cord blood after the delivery.
                  Results: Non-invasive prenatal foetal RHD exon 7 genotyping
                  analyses of maternal plasma samples was in complete
                  concordance with the serological analysis of cord blood in
                  all 24 RhD-negative pregnant women delivering 12 RhD-positive
                  and 12 RhD-negative newborns. RHD exon-10-specific PCR
                  amplicons were not detected in 2 out of 12 studied plasma
                  samples from women bearing RhD-positive foetus, despite the
                  positive amplification in RHD exon 7 region observed in all
                  cases. In 1 case red cell serology of cord blood revealed
                  that the mother had D--C--E--c+e+ Cw-- and the infant
                  D+C--E--c+e+ Cw+ phenotypes. RhD exon 10 real-time PCR
                  analysis of cord blood was also negative. These findings may
                  reflect that DCw-- paternally inherited haplotype probably
                  possesses no RHD exon 10. In another case no cord blood
                  sample has been available for additional studies. The
                  specificity of both RHD exon 7 and 10 systems approached
                  100\% since no RhD-positive signals were detected in women
                  currently pregnant with RhD-negative foetus (n = 8). Using
                  real-time PCR and DNA isolated from maternal plasma, we
                  easily differentiated pregnant woman whose RBCs had a weak D
                  phenotype (n = 4) from truly RhD-negative patients since the
                  threshold cycle (CT) for RHD exon 10 or 7 amplicons reached
                  nearly the same value like CT for control $\beta$-globin gene
                  amplicons detecting the total DNA present in maternal plasma.
                  However in these cases foetal RhD status cannot be
                  determined.Conclusion:Prediction offoetal RhD status from
                  maternal plasma is highly accurate and enables implementation
                  into clinical routine. We suggest that safe non-invasive
                  prenatal foetal RHD genotyping using maternal plasma should
                  involve the amplification of at least two RHD-specific

              of constrained bases. These elements reveal a small number of new
              coding exons, candidate stop codon readthrough events and over
              10,000 regions of overlapping synonymous constraint within
              protein-coding exons. We find 220 candidate RNA structural
              families, and nearly a million elements overlapping potential
              promoter, enhancer and insulator regions. We report specific
              amino acid residues that have undergone positive selection,
              280,000 non-coding elements exapted from mobile elements and more
              than 1,000 primate- and human-accelerated elements. Overlap with

              an integrated luminosity of 273 nb−1, 734 events, that is about

               Physicists have good models for describing the evolution of the

               light of the evolution of intelligence, seen as the ability of
               processing information. The main strength of this book is using

              galaxies VV114 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
              Array (ALMA) Band 3. We also find an 880-um counterpart with ALMA
              Band 7 (S\_880um = 11.2 mJy). A careful comparison of the
              intensities of the line and the continuum suggests that the line
              is a redshifted 12CO transition. A photometric redshift analysis
              using the infrared to radio data favors a CO redshift of z =
              2.467, although z = 3.622 is acceptable. We also find a hard
              X-ray counterpart, suggesting the presence of a luminous (L\_X ~
              10^44 erg/s) active galactic nucleus obscured by a large hydrogen
              column (N\_H ~ 2 x 10^23 cm^-2 if z = 2.47). A cosmological

              This demonstrates that ALMA has sufficient sensitivity to find an
