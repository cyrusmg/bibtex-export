  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Currently, little is known about the progression of an
              immune response against SARSCoV- 2 upon infection or
              sub-infection-exposure over time. We examined the serologic
              response in healthcare workers up to 12 weeks after a
              well-documented and contained outbreak and compared results with
              findings from earlier serologic testing in the same population.
              METHODS: This study followed 166 health care workers of the
              University Perinatal Care Center, Regensburg, Germany, for up to
              12 weeks. 27 of the subjects had previously tested positive for
              the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR testing and developed COVID-19.
              Serologic responses were tested with two independent commercially
              available test kits. RESULTS: 77.8 \% of COVID-19 study subjects
              developed a specific IgG-response over the course of the 12-week
              study, while none of the COVID-19 contact groups had a detectable
              IgG response. Amongst most COVID-19 patients the values of
              detectable IgG-responses significantly increased over time as
              confirmed with both tests, while that of positive IgA responses
              decreased. Between the number of reported symptoms and antibody
              responses in COVID-19 patients no correlation was found and no
              new cases of seroconversion were identified in asymptomatic
              coworkers with negative PCR during the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS:
              Immune response after COVID-19 increases significantly over time
              but still approximately 22 \% of COVID-19 patients did not mount
              a measurable serologic immune response within 60 days. Exposed
              co-workers did not develop any relevant antibody levels at all.
              We conclude that immunity after infection increases over time,
              but the antibody response does not develop reliably in all
              infected people.",

  abstract = "The comparison of related genomes has emerged as a powerful lens
              for genome interpretation. Here we report the sequencing and
              comparative analysis of 29 eutherian genomes. We confirm that at
              least 5.5\% of the human genome has undergone purifying
              selection, and locate constrained elements covering ‚àº4.2\% of the
              genome. We use evolutionary signatures and comparisons with
              experimental data sets to suggest candidate functions for ‚àº60\%
              of constrained bases. These elements reveal a small number of new
              coding exons, candidate stop codon readthrough events and over
              10,000 regions of overlapping synonymous constraint within
              protein-coding exons. We find 220 candidate RNA structural
              families, and nearly a million elements overlapping potential
              promoter, enhancer and insulator regions. We report specific
              amino acid residues that have undergone positive selection,
              280,000 non-coding elements exapted from mobile elements and more
              than 1,000 primate- and human-accelerated elements. Overlap with
              disease-associated variants indicates that our findings will be
              relevant for studies of human biology, health and disease.",
