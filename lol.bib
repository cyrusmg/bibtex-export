  abstract = "The improvement of doping control is an on-going race. Techniques
              to fight against doping are usually based on the direct detection
              of drugs or their metabolites by analytical methods such as
              chromatography hyphenated to mass spectrometry after ad hoc
              sample preparation. Nowadays, omic methods constitute an
              attractive development and advances have been achieved
              particularly by application of molecular biology tools for
              detection of anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS),
              erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) or to control human growth
              hormone misuses. These interesting results across different
              animal species have suggested that modification of gene
              expression offers promising new methods of improving the window
              of detection of banned substances by targeting their effects on
              blood cell gene expression. In this context, the present study
              describes the possibility of using a modified version of the
              dedicated Human IVD (in vitro Diagnostics)
              PAXgene\textregistered{} Blood RNA Kit for horse gene expression
              analysis in blood collected on PAXgene\textregistered{} tubes
              applied to the Horse Biological Passport. The commercial kit was
              only approved for human blood samples and has required an
              optimization of specific technical requirements for equine blood
              samples. Improvements and recommendations were achieved for
              sample collection, storage and RNA extraction procedure.
              Following these developments, RNA yield and quality were
              demonstrated to be suitable for downstream gene expression
              analysis by qPCR techniques.",

  abstract = "Since their first appearance on the Internet in 2012, designer
              benzodiazepines established as an additional, quickly growing
              compound class among the new psychoactive substances. Data
              regarding pharmacokinetic parameters, metabolism and
              detectability for new compounds is limited or often not
              available. One of these compounds, flubromazolam
              (8-bromo-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]benzodiazepine;
              the triazolo-analogue of flubromazepam), has been offered on the
              Internet from 2014 on. The purpose of the present study was to
              assess the time frame of detectability in biological samples
              along with preliminary basic pharmacokinetic parameters of the
              designer benzodiazepine flubromazolam. To investigate these one
              of the authors ingested a capsule containing 0.5 mg of the drug.
              Metabolism studies and suitability tests for the detection with
              immunochemical assays where performed with the samples obtained
              from the self-experiment and 5 authentic case samples.
              Flubromazolam and its' mono-hydroxylated metabolite were
              detectable by LC-MS/MS in urine for up to 6.5 and 8 days,
              respectively (LLOQ flubromazolam: 0.1 ng/ml). Peak serum
              concentrations were as low as 8 ng/ml (8 h post ingestion).
              Glucuronides were also detected. The terminal elimination
              half-life could be estimated in the range of 10-20 h.
              Immunochemical assays yielded negative results for serum samples
              and positive results for urine samples for up to five days post
              ingestion. The presented data demonstrates the detectability of a
              single uptake of 0.5 mg of flubromazolam in hair samples
              collected two weeks after drug uptake by LC-MS3 (cmax 0.6 pg/mg;
              LOD 0.01 pg/mg). The detected metabolites were in good agreement
              with those described in other studies.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to review the evidence on the
              epidemiology, physiopathology, categorization, and management of
              cholinergic urticaria. We specifically focused on several
              subtypes of cholinergic urticaria and investigated the
              relationship between cholinergic urticaria and idiopathic
              anhidrosis. METHODS: Using an integrative approach, we reviewed
              publications addressing the epidemiology, clinical features,
              diagnostic approach, physiopathology, subtype classification, and
              therapeutic approach to cholinergic urticaria. RESULTS: Multiple
              mechanisms were found to contribute to the development of
              cholinergic urticaria. This disorder should be classified based
              on the pathogenesis and clinical characteristics of each subtype.
              Such a classification system would lead to better management of
              this resistant condition. In particular, sweating function should
              be given more attention when examining patients with cholinergic
              urticaria. CONCLUSIONS: Because cholinergic urticaria is not a
              homogeneous disease, its subtype classification is essential for
              selection of the most suitable therapeutic method.",
