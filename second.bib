              assess the time frame of detectability in biological samples
              along with preliminary basic pharmacokinetic parameters of the
              designer benzodiazepine flubromazolam. To investigate these one

              from the self-experiment and 5 authentic case samples.

              detectable by LC-MS/MS in urine for up to 6.5 and 8 days,

              concentrations were as low as 8 ng/ml (8 h post ingestion).
              Glucuronides were also detected. The terminal elimination
              half-life could be estimated in the range of 10-20 h.
              Immunochemical assays yielded negative results for serum samples
              and positive results for urine samples for up to five days post
              ingestion. The presented data demonstrates the detectability of a

              diagnostic approach, physiopathology, subtype classification, and
              therapeutic approach to cholinergic urticaria. RESULTS: Multiple

              on the pathogenesis and clinical characteristics of each subtype.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Severe malaria is a major cause of childhood death
              and often the main reason for paediatric hospital admission in
              sub-Saharan Africa. Quinine is still the established treatment of
              choice, although evidence from Asia suggests that artesunate is
              associated with a lower mortality. We compared parenteral
              treatment with either artesunate or quinine in African children
              with severe malaria. METHODS: This open-label, randomised trial
              was undertaken in 11 centres in nine African countries. Children
              (<15 years) with severe falciparum malaria were randomly assigned
              to parenteral artesunate or parenteral quinine. Randomisation was
              in blocks of 20, with study numbers corresponding to treatment
              allocations kept inside opaque sealed paper envelopes. The trial
              was open label at each site, and none of the investigators or
              trialists, apart from for the trial statistician, had access to
              the summaries of treatment allocations. The primary outcome
              measure was in-hospital mortality, analysed by intention to
              treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN50258054. FINDINGS:
              5425 children were enrolled; 2712 were assigned to artesunate and
              2713 to quinine. All patients were analysed for the primary
              outcome. 230 (8·5\%) patients assigned to artesunate treatment
              died compared with 297 (10·9\%) assigned to quinine treatment
              (odds ratio [OR] stratified for study site 0·75, 95\% CI
              0·63-0·90; relative reduction 22·5\%, 95\% CI 8·1-36·9;
              p=0·0022). Incidence of neurological sequelae did not differ
              significantly between groups, but the development of coma
              (65/1832 [3·5\%] with artesunate vs 91/1768 [5·1\%] with quinine;
              OR 0·69 95\% CI 0·49-0·95; p=0·0231), convulsions (224/2712
              [8·3\%] vs 273/2713 [10·1\%]; OR 0·80, 0·66-0·97; p=0·0199), and
              deterioration of the coma score (166/2712 [6·1\%] vs 208/2713
              [7·7\%]; OR 0·78, 0·64-0·97; p=0·0245) were all significantly
              less frequent in artesunate recipients than in quinine
              recipients. Post-treatment hypoglycaemia was also less frequent
              in patients assigned to artesunate than in those assigned to
              quinine (48/2712 [1·8\%] vs 75/2713 [2·8\%]; OR 0·63, 0·43-0·91;
              p=0·0134). Artesunate was well tolerated, with no serious
              drug-related adverse effects. INTERPRETATION: Artesunate
              substantially reduces mortality in African children with severe
              malaria. These data, together with a meta-analysis of all trials
              comparing artesunate and quinine, strongly suggest that
              parenteral artesunate should replace quinine as the treatment of
              choice for severe falciparum malaria worldwide. FUNDING: The

               crystals, which form in the presence of increased urate
               concentrations. Although environmental factors contribute to
               hyperuricaemia, renal and gut excretion of urate is central to
               regulation of serum urate, and genetic factors are important.
               Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and release of interleukin
               1? have key roles in initiation of acute gout flares. A ?treat
               to target serum urate? approach is essential for effective gout
               management; long-term lowering of serum urate to less than 360
               ?mol/L leads to crystal dissolution and ultimately to
               suppression of flares. An allopurinol dose-escalation strategy
               is frequently effective for achieving treatment targets, and
               several new urate-lowering drugs are also available. Worldwide,
               rates of initiation and continuation of urate-lowering therapy
               are very low, and, consequently, achievement of serum urate
               targets is infrequent. Strategies to improve quality of gout

              execution of appropriate movement sequences. Two basal ganglia
              pathways have been classically hypothesized to regulate this
              process via opposing roles in movement facilitation and
              suppression. By using a series of state-dependent optogenetic
              manipulations, we dissected the contributions of each pathway and
              found that both the direct striatonigral pathway and the indirect
              striatopallidal pathway are necessary for smooth initiation and
              the execution of learned action sequences. Optogenetic inhibition
              or stimulation of each pathway before sequence initiation
              increased the latency for initiation: manipulations of the
              striatonigral pathway activity slowed action initiation, and
              those of the striatopallidal pathway aborted action initiation.
              The inhibition of each pathway after initiation also impaired
              ongoing execution. Furthermore, the subtle activation of
              striatonigral neurons sustained the performance of learned
              sequences, while striatopallidal manipulations aborted ongoing
              performance. These results suggest a supportive versus permissive

              cell types shape these dynamics in the live brain is poorly
              understood. To empower mechanistic studies, we created an optical
              technique, TEMPO, that records the aggregate trans-membrane
              voltage dynamics of genetically specified neurons in freely
              behaving mice. TEMPO has >10-fold greater sensitivity than prior
              fiber-optic techniques and attains the noise minimum set by
              quantum mechanical photon shot noise. After validating TEMPO's
              capacity to track established oscillations in the delta, theta,
              and gamma frequency bands, we compared the D1- and
              D2-dopamine-receptor-expressing striatal medium spiny neurons
              (MSNs), which are interspersed and electrically
              indistinguishable. Unexpectedly, MSN population dynamics
              exhibited two distinct coherent states that were commonly
              indiscernible in electrical recordings and involved synchronized
              hyperpolarizations across both MSN subtypes. Overall, TEMPO
              allows the deconstruction of normal and pathologic

  abstract = "Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons influence cortical state,
              plasticity, learning, and attention. They collectively innervate
              the entire cerebral cortex, differentially controlling
              acetylcholine efflux across different cortical areas and
              timescales. Such control might be achieved by differential inputs
              driving separable cholinergic outputs, although no input-output
              relationship on a brain-wide level has ever been demonstrated.
              Here, we identify input neurons to cholinergic cells projecting
              to specific cortical regions by infecting cholinergic axon
              terminals with a monosynaptically restricted viral tracer. This
              approach revealed several circuit motifs, such as central
              amygdala neurons synapsing onto basolateral amygdala-projecting
              cholinergic neurons or strong somatosensory cortical input to
              motor cortex-projecting cholinergic neurons. The presence of
              input cells in the parasympathetic midbrain nuclei contacting
              frontally projecting cholinergic neurons suggest that the network

              number of neurons observed with extracellular recordings and the
              ones to be expected based on anatomical and physiological
              considerations. This disagreement has been mainly attributed to
              the presence of sparsely firing neurons. However, it is also
              possible that this is due to limitations of the spike sorting
              algorithms used to process the data. To address this issue, we
              used realistic simulations of extracellular recordings and found
              a relatively poor spike sorting performance for simulations
              containing a large number of neurons. In fact, the number of
              correctly identified neurons for single-channel recordings showed
              an asymptotic behavior saturating at about 8--10 units, when up
              to 20 units were present in the data. This performance was
              significantly poorer for neurons with low firing rates, as these
              units were twice more likely to be missed than the ones with high
              firing rates in simulations containing many neurons. These
              results uncover one of the main reasons for the relatively low
              number of neurons found in extracellular recording and also
              stress the importance of further developments of spike sorting

  abstract = "Lysogens are bacterial cells that have survived after genomically
              incorporating the DNA of temperate bacteriophages infecting them.
              If an infection results in lysogeny, the lysogen continues to
              grow and divide normally, seemingly unaffected by the integrated
              viral genome known as a prophage. However, the prophage can still
              have an impact on the host's phenotype and overall fitness in
              certain environments. Additionally, the prophage within the
              lysogen can activate the lytic pathway via spontaneous prophage
              induction (SPI), killing the lysogen and releasing new progeny
              phages. These new phages can then lyse or lysogenize other
              susceptible nonlysogens, thereby impacting the competition
              between lysogens and nonlysogens. In a scenario with differing
              growth rates, it is not clear whether SPI would be beneficial or
              detrimental to the lysogens since it kills the host cell but also
              attacks nonlysogenic competitors, either lysing or lysogenizing
              them. Here we study the evolutionary dynamics of a mixture of
              lysogens and nonlysogens and derive general conditions on SPI
              rates for lysogens to displace nonlysogens. We show that there
              exists an optimal SPI rate for bacteriophage $\lambda$ and
              explain why it is so low. We also investigate the impact of
              stochasticity and conclude that even at low cell numbers SPI can
              still provide an advantage to the lysogens. These results
              corroborate recent experimental studies showing that lower SPI
              rates are advantageous for phage-phage competition, and establish
              theoretical bounds on the SPI rate in terms of ecological and
              environmental variables associated with lysogens having a
              competitive advantage over their nonlysogenic counterparts.",

              brain offers insights on how spontaneous integration and
              segregation of information relate to human cognition, and how
              this organization may be altered in different conditions, and
              neurological disorders. This is particularly relevant for
              patients in disorders of consciousness (DOC) following severe
              acquired brain damage and coma, one of the most devastating
              conditions in modern medical care. We present a novel data-driven
              methodology, connICA, which implements Independent Component
              Analysis (ICA) for the extraction of robust independent FC
              patterns (FC-traits) from a set of individual functional
              connectomes, without imposing any a priori data stratification
              into groups. We here apply connICA to investigate associations
              between network traits derived from task-free FC and
              cognitive/clinical features that define levels of consciousness.
              Three main independent FC-traits were identified and linked to
              consciousness-related clinical features. The first one represents
              the functional configuration of a ``resting'' human brain, and it
              is associated to a sedative (sevoflurane), the overall effect of
              the pathology and the level of arousal. The second FC-trait
              reflects the disconnection of the visual and sensory-motor
              connectivity patterns. It also relates to the time since the
              insult and to the ability of communicating with the external
              environment. The third FC-trait isolates the connectivity pattern
              encompassing the fronto-parietal and the default-mode network
              areas as well as the interaction between left and right
              hemispheres, which are also associated to the awareness of the
              self and its surroundings. Each FC-trait represents a distinct
              functional process with a role in the degradation of conscious
              states of functional brain networks, shedding further light on
              the functional sub-circuits that get disrupted in severe
              brain-damage.",

              Serotonergic neurons in the DRN have been theorized to encode
              punishment by opposing the reward signaling of dopamine neurons.
              Here, we show that DRN neurons encode reward, but not punishment,
              through 5-HT and glutamate. Optogenetic stimulation of DRN Pet-1
              neurons reinforces mice to explore the stimulation-coupled
              spatial region, shifts sucrose preference, drives optical
              self-stimulation, and directs sensory discrimination learning.
              DRN Pet-1 neurons increase their firing activity during reward
              tasks, and this activation can be used to rapidly change neuronal
              activity patterns in the cortex. Although DRN Pet-1 neurons are
              often associated with 5-HT, they also release glutamate, and both
              neurotransmitters contribute to reward signaling. These
              experiments demonstrate the ability of DRN neurons to organize
              reward behaviors and might provide insights into the underlying

              calculated remains unknown. It has been hypothesized that DA
              neurons receive RPE signals from the lateral habenula. Here, we
              tested how lesions of the habenular complex affect the response
              of optogenetically identified DA neurons in mice. We found that
              lesions impaired specific aspects of RPE signaling in DA neurons.
              The inhibitory responses caused by reward omission were greatly
              diminished while inhibitory responses to aversive stimuli, such
              as air puff-predictive cues or air puff, remained unimpaired.
              Furthermore, we found that after habenula lesions, DA neurons'
              ability to signal graded levels of positive RPEs became
              unreliable, yet significant excitatory responses still remained.
              These results demonstrate that the habenula plays a critical role
              in DA RPE signaling but suggest that it is not the exclusive

              heart failure development and progression in patients surviving
              the ischemic episode. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) plays a crucial
              role in heme degradation and in this way releases carbon
              monoxide, free iron, and biliverdin. This stress-inducible enzyme
              is induced by various oxidative and inflammatory signals.
              Consequently, biological actions of HO-1 are not limited to
              degradation of a toxic heme released from hemoproteins, but also
              provide an adaptive cellular response against chronic
              inflammation and oxidative injury. Indeed, the immunomodulatory
              and anti-inflammatory properties of HO-1 were demonstrated in
              several experimental studies, as well as in human cases of

              unknown. We recorded the activity of VTA neurons while mice
              associated different odour cues with appetitive and aversive
              outcomes. We found three types of neuron based on responses to
              odours and outcomes: approximately half of the neurons (type I,
              52\%) showed phasic excitation after reward-predicting odours and
              rewards in a manner consistent with reward prediction error
              coding; the other half of neurons showed persistent activity
              during the delay between odour and outcome that was modulated
              positively (type II, 31\%) or negatively (type III, 18\%) by the
              value of outcomes. Whereas the activity of type I neurons was
              sensitive to actual outcomes (that is, when the reward was
              delivered as expected compared to when it was unexpectedly
              omitted), the activity of type II and type III neurons was
              determined predominantly by reward-predicting odours. We 'tagged'
              dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons with the light-sensitive
              protein channelrhodopsin-2 and identified them based on their
              responses to optical stimulation while recording. All identified
              dopaminergic neurons were of type I and all GABAergic neurons
              were of type II. These results show that VTA GABAergic neurons
              signal expected reward, a key variable for dopaminergic neurons
              to calculate reward prediction error.",

              behavioural functions, we recorded from the two largest
              genetically defined inhibitory interneuron classes, the
              perisomatically targeting parvalbumin (PV) and the dendritically
              targeting somatostatin (SOM) neurons in anterior cingulate cortex
              of mice performing a reward foraging task. Here we show that PV
              and a subtype of SOM neurons form functionally homogeneous
              populations showing a double dissociation between both their
              inhibitory effects and behavioural correlates. Out of several
              events pertaining to behaviour, a subtype of SOM neurons
              selectively responded at reward approach, whereas PV neurons
              responded at reward leaving and encoded preceding stay duration.
              These behavioural correlates of PV and SOM neurons defined a
              behavioural epoch and a decision variable important for foraging
              (whether to stay or to leave), a crucial function attributed to
              the anterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore, PV neurons could fire
              in millisecond synchrony, exerting fast and powerful inhibition
              on principal cell firing, whereas the inhibitory effect of SOM
              neurons on firing output was weak and more variable, consistent
              with the idea that they respectively control the outputs of, and

              interneurons specializing in disinhibition and their in vivo
              function. Here we show that a class of interneurons that express
              vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) mediates disinhibitory
              control in multiple areas of neocortex and is recruited by

              modulate cerebral cortex indirectly via an inhibitory output to
              thalamus, bidirectionally controlled by direct- and
              indirect-pathway striatal projection neurons (dSPNs and iSPNs,

              activity by interacting with signals from sensory and motor
              systems. Here we describe a direct projection from the globus
              pallidus externus (GP), a central nucleus of the basal ganglia,
              to frontal regions of the cerebral cortex (FC). Two cell types
              make up the GP-FC projection, distinguished by their
              electrophysiological properties, cortical projections and
              expression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), a synthetic

              uncertain whether or not various forms of decision-related
              activity are causally related to decision making. Here we address
              this question by recording and reversibly inactivating the
              lateral intraparietal (LIP) and middle temporal (MT) areas of
              rhesus macaques performing a motion direction discrimination
              task. Neurons in area LIP exhibited firing rate patterns that
              directly resembled the evidence accumulation process posited to
              govern decision making, with strong correlations between their
              response fluctuations and the animal's choices. Neurons in area
              MT, in contrast, exhibited weak correlations between their
              response fluctuations and choices, and had firing rate patterns
              consistent with their sensory role in motion encoding. The
              behavioural impact of pharmacological inactivation of each area
              was inversely related to their degree of decision-related
              activity: while inactivation of neurons in MT profoundly impaired
              psychophysical performance, inactivation in LIP had no measurable
              impact on decision-making performance, despite having silenced
              the very clusters that exhibited strong decision-related
              activity. Although LIP inactivation did not impair psychophysical
              behaviour, it did influence spatial selection and oculomotor
              metrics in a free-choice control task. The absence of an effect
              on perceptual decision making was stable over trials and sessions
              and was robust to changes in stimulus type and task geometry,
              arguing against several forms of compensation. Thus,
              decision-related signals in LIP do not appear to be critical for
              computing perceptual decisions, and may instead reflect secondary
              processes. Our findings highlight a dissociation between decision
              correlation and causation, showing that strong neuron-decision
              correlations do not necessarily offer direct access to the neural
              computations underlying decisions.",

              ganglia circuitry in selection, how these nuclei contribute to

              expected. Mimicking these evaluation signals with optogenetic
              inhibition or excitation is sufficient to reinforce or discourage
              actions in a decision-making task. Moreover, cell-type-specific
              synaptic manipulations reveal that the inhibitory and excitatory

              serotonin (5-HT) neurons and GABA neurons in the DRN of behaving
              mice. Rewards including sucrose, food, sex and social interaction
              rapidly activate 5-HT neurons, but aversive stimuli including
              quinine and footshock do not. Both expected and unexpected
              rewards activate 5-HT neurons. After mice learn to wait for
              sucrose delivery, most 5-HT neurons fire tonically during waiting
              and then phasically on reward acquisition. Finally, GABA neurons
              are activated by aversive stimuli but inhibited when mice seek
              rewards. Thus, DRN 5-HT neurons positively encode a wide range of
              reward signals during anticipatory and consummatory phases of
              reward responses. Moreover, GABA neurons play a complementary
              role in reward processing.",

              diagnosed at an average age of 2.66 years and was clinically
              overt in 85\% of patients. Patients with clinical features were
              older (p = 0.001). Complaints were dominated by exercise
              intolerance (80\%), noticed at 5.33 years in average. Physical
              signs, observed at 6.75 years in average, were dominated by
              muscle weakness (62\%). Functional impairment was observed in
              64\% of patients, without any link with age (p = 0.255). Among 33
              patients, 7 improved. Creatine kinase (CK) and aspartate

              age.Electrophysiological abnormalities, diagnosed in average at
              6.5 years, were more frequent after the first decade (p =
              0.0005). Myogenic pattern was predominant (42\%). Nerve

              electrophysiological features. Higher protein intake was related
              to fewer complaints and physical anomalies. CONCLUSION:
              Neuromuscular investigation is warranted even in asymptomatic
              patients, as early as the diagnosis of GSDIII is suspected.
              Muscle involvement can be disabling even in children. Favorable

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Sentinel-lymph-node biopsy is associated with
              increased melanoma-specific survival (i.e., survival until death
              from melanoma) among patients with node-positive
              intermediate-thickness melanomas (1.2 to 3.5 mm). The value of
              completion lymph-node dissection for patients with sentinel-node
              metastases is not clear. METHODS: In an international trial, we
              randomly assigned patients with sentinel-node metastases detected
              by means of standard pathological assessment or a multimarker
              molecular assay to immediate completion lymph-node dissection
              (dissection group) or nodal observation with ultrasonography
              (observation group). The primary end point was melanoma-specific
              survival. Secondary end points included disease-free survival and
              the cumulative rate of nonsentinel-node metastasis. RESULTS:
              Immediate completion lymph-node dissection was not associated
              with increased melanoma-specific survival among 1934 patients
              with data that could be evaluated in an intention-to-treat
              analysis or among 1755 patients in the per-protocol analysis. In
              the per-protocol analysis, the mean ($\pm$SE) 3-year rate of
              melanoma-specific survival was similar in the dissection group
              and the observation group (86$\pm$1.3\% and 86$\pm$1.2\%,
              respectively; P=0.42 by the log-rank test) at a median follow-up
              of 43 months. The rate of disease-free survival was slightly
              higher in the dissection group than in the observation group
              (68$\pm$1.7\% and 63$\pm$1.7\%, respectively; P=0.05 by the
              log-rank test) at 3 years, based on an increased rate of disease
              control in the regional nodes at 3 years (92$\pm$1.0\% vs.
              77$\pm$1.5\%; P<0.001 by the log-rank test); these results must
              be interpreted with caution. Nonsentinel-node metastases,
              identified in 11.5\% of the patients in the dissection group,
              were a strong, independent prognostic factor for recurrence
              (hazard ratio, 1.78; P=0.005). Lymphedema was observed in 24.1\%
              of the patients in the dissection group and in 6.3\% of those in
              the observation group. CONCLUSIONS: Immediate completion
              lymph-node dissection increased the rate of regional disease
              control and provided prognostic information but did not increase
              melanoma-specific survival among patients with melanoma and

              Organization (WHO) grade IV malignant glioma is dismal, and there
              is currently no effective therapy. We conducted a dose-finding
              and toxicity study in this population of patients, evaluating
              convection-enhanced, intratumoral delivery of the recombinant
              nonpathogenic polio-rhinovirus chimera (PVSRIPO). PVSRIPO
              recognizes the poliovirus receptor CD155, which is widely
              expressed in neoplastic cells of solid tumors and in major
              components of the tumor microenvironment. METHODS: We enrolled
              consecutive adult patients who had recurrent supratentorial WHO
              grade IV malignant glioma, confirmed on histopathological
              testing, with measurable disease (contrast-enhancing tumor of
              $\geq$1 cm and $\leq$5.5 cm in the greatest dimension). The study
              evaluated seven doses, ranging between 107 and 1010 50\%
              tissue-culture infectious doses (TCID50), first in a
              dose-escalation phase and then in a dose-expansion phase.
              RESULTS: From May 2012 through May 2017, a total of 61 patients
              were enrolled and received a dose of PVSRIPO. Dose level -1
              (5.0$\times$107 TCID50) was identified as the phase 2 dose. One
              dose-limiting toxic effect was observed; a patient in whom dose
              level 5 (1010 TCID50) was administered had a grade 4 intracranial
              hemorrhage immediately after the catheter was removed. To
              mitigate locoregional inflammation of the infused tumor with
              prolonged glucocorticoid use, dose level 5 was deescalated to
              reach the phase 2 dose. In the dose-expansion phase, 19\% of the
              patients had a PVSRIPO-related adverse event of grade 3 or
              higher. Overall survival among the patients who received PVSRIPO
              reached a plateau of 21\% (95\% confidence interval, 11 to 33) at
              24 months that was sustained at 36 months. CONCLUSIONS:
              Intratumoral infusion of PVSRIPO in patients with recurrent WHO
              grade IV malignant glioma confirmed the absence of neurovirulent
              potential. The survival rate among patients who received PVSRIPO
              immunotherapy was higher at 24 and 36 months than the rate among
              historical controls. (Funded by the Brain Tumor Research Charity

              synthetic biology, where repairing natural or synthetic systems
              broken by evolutionary processes may be valuable. Here, we use a
              synthetic positive-feedback (PF) gene circuit integrated into
              haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells to test if the population
              can restore lost PF function. In previous evolution experiments,
              mutations in a gene eliminated the fitness costs of PF
              activation. Since PF activation also provides drug resistance,
              exposing such compromised or broken mutants to both drug and
              inducer should create selection pressure to regain drug
              resistance and possibly PF function. Indeed, evolving 7 PF mutant
              strains in the presence of drug revealed 3 adaptation scenarios
              through genomic, PF-external mutations that elevate PF basal
              expression, possibly by affecting transcription, translation,
              degradation, and other fundamental cellular processes.
              Nonfunctional mutants gained drug resistance without ever
              developing high expression, while quasifunctional and
              dysfunctional PF mutants developed high expression
              nongenetically, which then diminished, although more slowly for
              dysfunctional mutants where revertant clones arose. These results

              affect regulatory network dynamics and evolutionary dynamics,

              susceptibility contributes to the persistence of biofilm
              infections such as those associated with implanted devices. The
              protective mechanisms at work in biofilms appear to be distinct
              from those that are responsible for conventional antibiotic

              rise to glycogen-storage disease type VI (Hers disease; MIM
              232700). We report the identification of the first mutations in
              PYGL, the gene encoding the liver isoform of glycogen
              phosphorylase, in three patients with Hers disease. These are two
              splice-site mutations and two missense mutations. A mutation of
              the 5′ splice-site consensus of intron 14 causes the retention of
              intron 14 and the utilization of two illegitimate 5′ splice
              sites, whereas a mutation of the 3′ splice-site consensus of
              intron 4 causes the skipping of exon 5. Two missense mutations,
              N338S and N376K, both cause nonconservative replacements of amino
              acids that are absolutely conserved even in yeast and bacterial
              phosphorylases. We also report corrections of the PYGL coding
              sequence, sequence polymorphisms, and a partial PYGL gene
              structure with introns in the same positions as in PYGM, the gene
              of the muscle isoform of phosphorylase. Our findings demonstrate
              that PYGL mutations cause Hers disease, and they may improve

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In many neurologic diagnoses, significant
              interindividual variability exists in the outcomes of
              rehabilitation. One factor that may impact response to
              rehabilitation interventions is genetic variation. Genetic
              variation refers to the presence of differences in the DNA
              sequence among individuals in a population. Genetic polymorphisms
              are variations that occur relatively commonly and, while not
              disease-causing, can impact the function of biological systems.
              The purpose of this article is to describe genetic polymorphisms
              that may impact neuroplasticity, motor learning, and recovery
              after stroke. SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS: Genetic polymorphisms for
              brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), dopamine, and
              apolipoprotein E have been shown to impact neuroplasticity and
              motor learning. Rehabilitation interventions that rely on the
              molecular and cellular pathways of these factors may be impacted
              by the presence of the polymorphism. For example, it has been
              hypothesized that individuals with the BDNF polymorphism may show
              a decreased response to neuroplasticity-based interventions,
              decreased rate of learning, and overall less recovery after
              stroke. However, research to date has been limited and additional
              work is needed to fully understand the role of genetic variation
              in learning and recovery. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE:
              Genetic polymorphisms should be considered as possible predictors
              or covariates in studies that investigate neuroplasticity, motor
              learning, or motor recovery after stroke. Future predictive
              models of stroke recovery will likely include a combination of
              genetic factors and other traditional factors (eg, age, lesion
              type, corticospinal tract integrity) to determine an individual's
              expected response to a specific rehabilitation intervention.",

              growing evidence suggests that its core endogenous role may be to
              promote flexible adaptation to changes in the causal structure of
              the environment. This stems from two functions of endogenous
              serotonin activation: inhibiting learned responses that are not
              currently adaptive and driving plasticity to reconfigure them.
              These mirror dual functions of dopamine in invigorating
              reward-related responses and promoting plasticity that reinforces
              new ones. However, while dopamine neurons are known to be
              activated by reward prediction errors, consistent with theories
              of reinforcement learning, the reported firing patterns of
              serotonin neurons do not accord with any existing theories. Here,
              we used long-term photometric recordings in mice to study a
              genetically-defined population of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons
              whose activity we could link to normal reversal learning. We

              negative prediction errors, thus reporting the kind of surprise
              signal proposed to promote learning in conditions of uncertainty.
              Furthermore, by comparing cue responses of serotonin and dopamine
              neurons we found differences in learning rates that could explain
              the importance of serotonin in inhibiting perseverative
              responding. Together, these findings show how the firing patterns
              of serotonin neurons support a role in cognitive flexibility and

              treat the affected individual clinically. As a starting point to
              overcome these challenges, we need to refine our understanding of
              the complexity of NMDAR structure function. In this regard, DAVs
              have expanded our knowledge of NMDARs because they do not just

              unbiased view of structural elements that are important to the
              biology of NMDARs. Indeed, established NMDAR structure-function

              action of cis- and trans-acting regulators. The activity and mode
              of action of these regulators can reflect different requirements
              for gene products in different environments. A well-studied
              example is the regulatory function that integrates the
              environmental availability of glucose and lactose to control the
              Escherichia colilac operon. Most studies of lac operon regulation
              have focused on a few closely related strains. To determine the
              range of natural variation in lac regulatory function, we
              introduced a reporter construct into 23 diverse E. coli strains
              and measured expression with combinations of inducer
              concentrations. We found a wide range of regulatory functions.
              Several functions were similar to the one observed in a reference
              lab strain, whereas others depended weakly on the presence of
              cAMP. Some characteristics of the regulatory function were
              explained by the genetic relatedness of strains, indicating that
              differences varied on relatively short time scales. The
              regulatory characteristics explained by genetic relatedness were
              among those that best predicted the initial growth of strains
              following transition to a lactose environment, suggesting a role
              for selection. Finally, we transferred the lac operon, with the
              lacI regulatory gene, from five natural isolate strains into a
              reference lab strain. The regulatory function of these hybrid
              strains revealed the effect of local and global regulatory
              elements in controlling expression. Together, this work
              demonstrates that regulatory functions can be varied within a
              species and that there is variation within a species to best
              match a function to particular environments.IMPORTANCE The lac
              operon of Escherichia coli is a classic model for studying gene
              regulation. This study has uncovered features such as the
              environmental input logic controlling gene expression, as well as
              gene expression bistability and hysteresis. Most lac operon
              studies have focused on a few lab strains, and it is not known
              how generally those findings apply to the diversity of E. coli
              strains. We examined the environmental dependence of lac gene
              regulation in 20 natural isolates of E. coli and found a wide
              range of regulatory responses. By transferring lac genes from
              natural isolate strains into a common reference strain, we found
              that regulation depends on both the lac genes themselves and on
              the broader genetic background, indicating potential for
              still-greater regulatory diversity following horizontal gene
              transfer. Our results reveal that there is substantial natural
              variation in the regulation of the lac operon and indicate that
              this variation can be ecologically meaningful.",

              The effect of NSAID on AKI incidence in ultramarathon runners is
              unclear. METHODS: Multisite randomised double-blind
              placebo-controlled trial in the Gobi, Atacama, Ecuador and Sri
              Lankan deserts to determine whether ibuprofen (400 mg every 4
              hours) would be non-inferior to placebo during a 50-mile (80 km)
              foot race. The primary outcome was incidence of AKI defined as
              severity categories of 'risk' of injury of 1.5$\times$ baseline
              creatinine (Cr) or 'injury' as 2$\times$ Cr, combined to
              calculate total incidence at the finish line. Non-inferiority
              margin for difference in AKI rates was defined as 15\%. RESULTS:
              Eighty-nine participants (47\% ibuprofen and 53\% placebo) were
              enrolled with similar demographics between groups. The overall
              incidence of AKI was 44\%. Intent-to-treat analysis found 22
              (52\%) ibuprofen versus 16 (34\%) placebo users developed AKI
              (18\% difference, 95\% CI -4\% to 41\%; OR 2.1, 95\% CI 0.9 to
              5.1) with a number needed to harm of 5.5. Greater severity of AKI
              was seen with ibuprofen compared with placebo (risk=38\% vs 26\%;
              95\% CI -9\% to 34\%; injury=14\% vs 9\%; 95\% CI -10\% to 21\%).
              Slower finishers were less likely to encounter AKI (OR 0.67, 95\%
              CI 0.47 to 0.98) and greater weight loss (-1.3\%) increased AKI
              (OR 1.24, 95\% CI 1.00 to 1.63). CONCLUSION: There were increased
              rates of AKI in those who took ibuprofen, and although not
              statistically inferior to placebo by a small margin, there was a
              number needed to harm of 5.5 people to cause 1 case of AKI.
              Consideration should therefore be taken before ingesting NSAID
              during endurance running as it could exacerbate renal injury.

              prefrontal cortex (PFCx) in different wake-sleep states of adult

              a large (roughly 70\%) subset of BF neurons, which we named BF
              tonic neurons (BFTNs). BFTNs fired tonically at 2-8 Hz without
              significantly changing their average firing rate across
              wake-sleep states. As such, these cannot be classified as
              cholinergic neurons. BFTNs substantially increased the spiking
              variability during waking and rapid-eye-movement sleep, by
              exhibiting frequent spike bursts with <50-ms interspike interval.
              Spike bursts among BFTNs were highly correlated, leading to

              expected magnitude of thrombotic event reduction mediated by

              2 common genetic variants, which alter levels of FXI, with a
              range of human phenotypes. We combined variants into a genetic
              score standardized to a 30\% increase in relative activated
              partial thromboplastin time, equivalent to what can be achieved
              with pharmacological FXI reduction. Using data from 371 695
              participants in the United Kingdom Biobank and 2 large-scale
              genome-wide association studies, we examined the effect of this
              FXI score on thrombotic and bleeding end points. Results- Genetic
              disposition to lower FXI levels was associated with reduced risks
              of venous thrombosis (odds ratio, 95\% CI; P value; odds
              ratio=0.1, 0.07-0.14; P=3$\times$10-43) and ischemic stroke (odds

              bleeding (odds ratio=0.7, 0.45-1.04; P=0.0739). The observed
              relative risk reductions were consistent within a range of

              bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.
              The morbidity and mortality of these diseases remain high even
              with optimal medical management. In our attempts to devise new
              therapies for these disorders, it is crucial to improve our

              injury. A major line of investigation seeks to characterize the
              cellular and molecular responses of the lung to oxidant insults.
              Much progress has been made in our understanding of the role of
              the ``classic'' antioxidant enzymes (e.g., superoxide dismutase,
              catalase, glutathione peroxidase) in mediating the lung's

              vital roles in the lung's adaptive and/or protective response to
              oxidative stress. One such stress-response protein is heme
              oxygenase-1, HO-1. Since the identification of HO-1 in 1968, many
              of the studies involving this enzyme were understandably focused
              on the regulation and function of HO-1 in heme metabolism. This
              emphasis is self-evident as HO-1 catalyzes the first and
              rate-limiting step in heme degradation. Interestingly, however,
              evidence accumulated over the past 25 years demonstrates that
              HO-1 is induced not only by the substrate heme but also by a
              variety of non-heme inducers such as heavy metals, endotoxin,
              heat shock, inflammatory cytokines, and prostaglandins. The
              chemical diversity of HO-1 inducers led to the speculation that
              HO-1, besides its role in heme degradation, may also play a vital
              function in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Further support for
              this hypothesis was provided by Tyrrell and colleagues who showed
              in 1989 that HO-1 is also highly induced by a variety of agents
              causing oxidative stress. Subsequently, many investigators have
              focused their attention on the function and regulation of HO-1 in
              various in vitro and in vivo models of oxidant-mediated cellular
              and tissue injury. The magnitude of HO-1 induction after
              oxidative stress and the wide distribution of this enzyme in
              systemic tissues coupled with the intriguing biological
              activities of the catalytic byproducts, carbon monoxide, iron,
              and bilirubin, makes HO-1 a highly attractive and interesting
              candidate stress-response protein which may play key role(s) in
              mediating protection against oxidant-mediated lung injury. This
              review will focus on the current understanding of the
              physiological significance of HO-1 induction and the molecular
              regulation of HO-1 gene expression in response to oxidative
              stress. We hope that this discussion will stimulate interest and
              investigations into a field which is still largely uncharted in
              the pulmonary research community.",

              recessive disease resulting from deficient glycogen-branching
              enzyme (GBE) activity. The classic and most common form is
              progressive liver cirrhosis and failure leading to either liver
              transplantation or death by 5 yr of age. However, the liver
              disease is not always progressive. In addition, a neuromuscular
              type of the disease has been reported. The molecular basis of
              GSD-IV is not known, nor is there a known reason for the clinical
              variability. We studied the GBE gene in patients with various
              presentations of GSD-IV. Three point mutations in the GBE gene
              were found in two patients with the classical presentation:
              R515C, F257L, and R524X. Transient expression experiments showed
              that these mutations inactivated GBE activity. Two point
              mutations, L224P and Y329S, were detected in two separate alleles
              of a patient with the nonprogressive hepatic form. The L224P
              resulted in complete loss of GBE activity, whereas the Y329S
              resulted in loss of approximately 50\% of GBE activity. The Y329S
              allele was also detected in another patient with the
              nonprogressive form of GSD-IV but not in 35 unrelated controls or
              in patients with the more severe forms of GSD-IV. A 210-bp
              deletion from nucleotide 873 to 1082 of the GBE cDNA was detected
              in a patient with the fatal neonatal neuromuscular presentation.
              This deletion, representing the loss of one full exon, was caused
              by a 3' acceptor splicing site mutation (ag to aa). The deletion
              abolished GBE activity. Our studies indicate that the three
              different forms of GSD-IV were caused by mutations in the same
              GBE gene. The data also suggest that the significant retention of
              GBE activity in the Y329S allele may be a reason for the mild
              disease. Further study of genotype/phenotype correlations may
              yield useful information in predicting the clinical outcomes.",

              GDE absent in liver but retained in muscle (type IIIb). The
              molecular basis for this enzymatic variability is largely
              unknown. In the present study, the analysis of the GDE gene in

              polymorphism (SSCP), DNA sequencing, restriction analysis, and
              family studies, revealed each of them as being a compound
              heterozygote for two different mutations. The first mutant
              alleles in all three patients involved mutations in exon 3 at
              amino acid codon 6 of the GDE protein. Two had an AG deletion at
              nucleotides 17 and 18 of the GDE cDNA (17delAG) which resulted in
              change of subsequent amino acid sequence and a truncated protein
              (25X); the other had a C to T transition at nucleotide 16 of the
              cDNA which changed a Glutamine codon to a stop codon (Q6X). The
              17delAG mutation was also found in 8 of the 10 additional
              GSD-IIIb patients. The Q6X mutation was found in one of the
              remaining two GSD-IIIb patients. These two mutations were not
              found in any of the 31 GSD-IIIa patients, 2 GSD-IIId patients,
              nor 28 unrelated normal controls. The second mutant alleles in
              each of the three GSD-IIIb patients were R864X, R1228X, and
              W68OX. The R864X and R1228X were not unique for GSD-IIIb as they
              were also found in GSD-IIIa patients (frequency of 10.3\% and
              5.2\% in Caucasian patients, respectively). Our data demonstrated
              that both IIIa and IIIb had mutations in the same GDE gene and
              established for the first time the molecular basis of GSD-III
              that differentially expressed in liver and muscle. The striking
              and specific association of exon 3 mutations with GSD-IIIb may
              provide insight into mechanisms controlling tissue-specific
              expression of the GDE gene. The identification of exon 3
              mutations has clinical significance as well because it
              distinguished GSD-IIIb from IIIa hence permitting diagnosis from
              a blood sample rather than a more invasive muscle biopsy.",

              developed vacuolar degeneration of the renal tubular epithelium,
              the thyroid follicular cells, and the macrophage-phagocytic cells
              of the lymph nodes, spleen, lung, liver, and thymus. Some rats

              lesions similar to those caused by locoweed and is probably the
              primary locoweed toxin; 2) castanospermine at high doses causes

              castanospermine intoxication results in degenerative vacuolation

              studies in oxidative stress injuries, using carefully validated
              reference genes has not received sufficient attention in related

  abstract = "The survival of animals depends critically on prioritizing
              responses to motivationally salient stimuli. While it is
              generally believed that motivational salience increases decision
              speed, the quantitative relationship between motivational
              salience and decision speed, measured by reaction time (RT),
              remains unclear. Here we show that the neural correlate of
              motivational salience in the basal forebrain (BF), defined
              independently of RT, is coupled with faster and also more precise
              decision speed. In rats performing a reward-biased simple RT
              task, motivational salience was encoded by BF bursting response
              that occurred before RT. We found that faster RTs were tightly
              coupled with stronger BF motivational salience signals.
              Furthermore, the fraction of RT variability reflecting the
              contribution of intrinsic noise in the decision-making process
              was actively suppressed in faster RT distributions with stronger
              BF motivational salience signals. Artificially augmenting the BF
              motivational salience signal via electrical stimulation led to
              faster and more precise RTs and supports a causal relationship.
              Together, these results not only describe for the first time, to
              our knowledge, the quantitative relationship between motivational
              salience and faster decision speed, they also reveal the
              quantitative coupling relationship between motivational salience
              and more precise RT. Our results further establish the existence
              of an early and previously unrecognized step in the
              decision-making process that determines both the RT speed and
              variability of the entire decision-making process and suggest
              that this novel decision step is dictated largely by the BF
              motivational salience signal. Finally, our study raises the
              hypothesis that the dysregulation of decision speed in conditions
              such as depression, schizophrenia, and cognitive aging may result
              from the functional impairment of the motivational salience

  abstract = "Neural circuits are exquisitely organized, consisting of many
              different neuronal subpopulations. However, it is difficult to
              assess the functional roles of these subpopulations using
              conventional extracellular recording techniques because these
              techniques do not easily distinguish spikes from different
              neuronal populations. To overcome this limitation, we have
              developed PINP (Photostimulation-assisted Identification of
              Neuronal Populations), a method of tagging neuronal populations
              for identification during in vivo electrophysiological recording.
              The method is based on expressing the light-activated channel
              channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) to restricted neuronal subpopulations.
              ChR2-tagged neurons can be detected electrophysiologically in
              vivo since illumination of these neurons with a brief flash of
              blue light triggers a short latency reliable action potential. We
              demonstrate the feasibility of this technique by expressing ChR2
              in distinct populations of cortical neurons using two different
              strategies. First, we labeled a subpopulation of cortical
              neurons-mainly fast-spiking interneurons-by using
              adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver ChR2 in a transgenic
              mouse line in which the expression of Cre recombinase was driven
              by the parvalbumin promoter. Second, we labeled subpopulations of
              excitatory neurons in the rat auditory cortex with ChR2 based on
              projection target by using herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), which
              is efficiently taken up by axons and transported retrogradely; we
              find that this latter population responds to acoustic stimulation
              differently from unlabeled neurons. Tagging neurons is a novel
              application of ChR2, used in this case to monitor activity
              instead of manipulating it. PINP can be readily extended to other
              populations of genetically identifiable neurons, and will provide
              a useful method for probing the functional role of different
              neuronal populations in vivo.",

              circuit dynamics to behavior requires precise control of sensory
              stimuli and measurement of body movements. Head-fixation has been
              used for behavioral research, particularly in non-human primates,
              to facilitate precise stimulus control, behavioral monitoring and
              neural recording. However, choice-based, perceptual decision
              tasks by head-fixed mice have only recently been introduced.
              Training mice relies on motivating mice using water restriction.
              Here we describe procedures for head-fixation, water restriction
              and behavioral training for head-fixed mice, with a focus on
              active, whisker-based tactile behaviors. In these experiments
              mice had restricted access to water (typically 1 ml/day). After
              ten days of water restriction, body weight stabilized at
              approximately 80\% of initial weight. At that point mice were
              trained to discriminate sensory stimuli using operant
              conditioning. Head-fixed mice reported stimuli by licking in
              go/no-go tasks and also using a forced choice paradigm using a
              dual lickport. In some cases mice learned to discriminate sensory
              stimuli in a few trials within the first behavioral session.
              Delay epochs lasting a second or more were used to separate
              sensation (e.g. tactile exploration) and action (i.e. licking).
              Mice performed a variety of perceptual decision tasks with high
              performance for hundreds of trials per behavioral session. Up to
              four months of continuous water restriction showed no adverse
              health effects. Behavioral performance correlated with the degree
              of water restriction, supporting the importance of controlling
              access to water. These behavioral paradigms can be combined with
              cellular resolution imaging, random access photostimulation, and
              whole cell recordings.",

              Plasma haptoglobin and hemopexin scavenge free hemoglobin and
              heme, respectively, but can be depleted in hemolytic states.
              Haptoglobin and hemopexin supplementation protect tissues,
              including the vasculature, liver and kidneys. It is widely
              assumed that these protective effects are due primarily to
              hemoglobin and heme clearance from the vasculature. However, this
              simple assumption does not account for the consequent
              cytoprotective adaptation seen in cells and organs. To further
              address the mechanism, we used a hyperhemolytic murine model
              (Townes-SS) of sickle cell disease to examine cellular responses
              to haptoglobin and hemopexin supplementation. A single infusion
              of haptoglobin or hemopexin ($\pm$ equimolar hemoglobin) in
              SS-mice increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the liver, kidney
              and skin several fold within 1 hour and decreased nuclear NF-ĸB

              Plasma hemoglobin and heme levels were not significantly changed

              and hemopexin also inhibited hypoxia/reoxygenation and
              lipopolysaccharide-induced vaso-occlusion in SS-mice. Inhibition
              of HO-1 activity with tin protoporphyrin blocked the protections
              afforded by haptoglobin and hemopexin in SS-mice. The HO-1
              reaction product carbon monoxide, fully restored the protection,
              in part by inhibiting Weibel-Palade body mobilization of
              P-selectin and von Willebrand factor to endothelial cell
              surfaces. Thus, the mechanism by which haptoglobin and hemopexin

              cellular responses is linked to increased HO-1 activity.",

              two-photon targeted cell-attached recording to compare the
              response properties of parvalbumin-expressing neurons (PVNs) and
              pyramidal glutamatergic neurons (PyrNs). The transition to

              best frequency of PyrNs. The presence of pup odors significantly

              complimentary increase in spontaneous and evoked activity of

  abstract = "UNLABELLED: Acetylcholine and noradrenaline are major
              neuromodulators that affect sensory processing in the cortex.
              Modality-specific sensory information is processed in defined
              areas of the cortex, but it is unclear whether cholinergic
              neurons in the basal forebrain (BF) and noradrenergic neurons in
              the locus ceruleus (LC) project to and modulate these areas in a
              sensory modality-selective manner. Here, we mapped BF and LC
              projections to different sensory cortices of the mouse using dual
              retrograde tracing. We found that while the innervation of
              cholinergic neurons into sensory cortices is predominantly
              modality specific, the projections of noradrenergic neurons
              diverge onto multiple sensory cortices. Consistent with this
              anatomy, optogenetic activation of cholinergic neurons in BF
              subnuclei induces modality-selective desynchronization in
              specific sensory cortices, whereas activation of noradrenergic LC
              neurons induces broad desynchronization throughout multiple
              sensory cortices. Thus, we demonstrate a clear distinction in the
              organization and function of cholinergic BF and noradrenergic LC
              projections into primary sensory cortices: cholinergic BF neurons
              are highly selective in their projections and modulation of
              specific sensory cortices, whereas noradrenergic LC neurons
              broadly innervate and modulate multiple sensory cortices.
              SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Neuromodulatory inputs from the basal
              forebrain (BF) and locus ceruleus (LC) are widespread in the
              mammalian cerebral cortex and are known to play important roles
              in attention and arousal, but little is known about the
              selectivity of their cortical projections. Using a dual retrobead
              tracing technique along with optogenetic stimulation, we have
              identified anatomic and functional differences in the way
              cholinergic BF neurons and noradrenergic LC neurons project into
              primary sensory cortices. While BF projections are highly
              selective to individual sensory cortices, LC projections diverge
              into multiple sensory cortices. To our knowledge, this is the
              first definitive proof that BF and LC projections to primary
              sensory cortices show both anatomic and functional differences in
              selectivity for modulating cortical activity.",

              However, the presynaptic partners governing BFCS activity still

              neuromodulatory systems in the mammalian brain, and plays a key

              projecting BF neurons, comprised of mainly magnocellular
              cholinergic and GABAergic neurons, are widely distributed across
              several brain regions that spatially overlap with the ventral
              striatopallidal system at the ventral pallidum (VP). As a first
              step toward untangling the respective functions of spatially
              overlapping BF and VP systems, the goal of this study was to
              comprehensively characterize the behavioral correlates and
              physiological properties of heterogeneous neuronal populations in
              the BF region. We found that, while rats performed a
              reward-biased simple reaction time task, distinct neuronal
              populations encode either motivational salience or movement
              information. The motivational salience of attended stimuli is
              encoded by phasic bursting activity of a large population of
              slow-firing neurons that have large, broad, and complex action
              potential waveforms. In contrast, two other separate groups of
              neurons encode movement-related information, and respectively
              increase and decrease firing rates while rats maintained
              fixation. These two groups of neurons mostly have higher firing
              rates and small, narrow action potential waveforms. These results
              support the conclusion that multiple neurophysiologically
              distinct neuronal populations in the BF region operate
              independently of each other as parallel functional circuits.
              These observations also caution against interpreting neuronal
              activity in this region as a homogeneous population reflecting
              the function of either BF or VP alone. We suggest that salience-
              and movement-related neuronal populations likely correspond to BF

              activity in search of signatures of stress responses in the
              entire mouse brain. We used serial two-photon tomography to
              detect expression of c-FosGFP - a marker of neuronal activation -
              in c-fosGFP transgenic mice subjected to the learned helplessness
              (LH) procedure, a widely used model of stress-induced
              depression-like phenotype in laboratory animals. We found that
              mice showing ``helpless'' behavior had an overall brain-wide
              reduction in the level of neuronal activation compared with mice
              showing ``resilient'' behavior, with the exception of a few brain
              areas, including the locus coeruleus, that were more activated in

              powerful paradigm widely used in basic and clinical research to
              study inhibitory control is the stop signal task (SST). Recent
              years have seen a surging interest in translating the SST to
              rodents to study the neural mechanisms underlying inhibitory
              control. However, significant differences in task designs and
              behavioral strategies between rodent and primate studies have
              made it difficult to directly compare the two literatures. In
              this study, we developed a rodent-appropriate SST and
              characterized both reactive and proactive control in rats. For
              reactive inhibitory control, we found that, unlike in primates,
              incorrect stop trials in rodents result from two independent
              types of errors: an initial failure-to-stop error or, after
              successful stopping, a subsequent failure-to-wait error.
              Conflating failure-to-stop and failure-to-wait errors
              systematically overestimates the covert latency of reactive
              inhibition, the stop signal reaction time (SSRT). To correctly
              estimate SSRT, we developed and validated a new method that
              provides an unbiased SSRT estimate independent of the ability to
              wait. For proactive inhibitory control, we found that rodents
              adjust both their reaction time and the ability to stop following
              failure-to-wait errors and successful stop trials, but not after
              failure-to-stop errors. Together, these results establish a valid
              rodent model that utilizes proactive and reactive inhibitory
              control strategies similar to primates, and highlight the
              importance of dissociating initial stopping from subsequent

              ERPs are generated by local activity within the cerebral cortex,

              proceeds and disappearing from the CS period during extinction.
              This finding motivates a reinterpretation of rodent fear

              cervical traction and cervical strengthening exercises twice

              increasing the likelihood of success with cervical traction from
              44 to 79.2\%. If at least four out of five variables were
              present, the +LR was equal to 23.1 (2.5-227.9), increasing the

              substantial socioeconomic impact. Complementary or alternative
              therapies are increasingly being used by patients to treat
              headache pain, and spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) is among the
              most common of these. OBJECTIVE:To assess the
              efficacy/effectiveness of SMT for chronic headache through a
              systematic review of randomized clinical trials. STUDY
              SELECTION:Randomized clinical trials on chronic headache
              (tension, migraine and cervicogenic) were included in the review
              if they compared SMT with other interventions or placebo. The
              trials had to have at least 1 patient-rated outcome measure such
              as pain severity, frequency, duration, improvement, use of
              analgesics, disability, or quality of life. Studies were
              identified through a comprehensive search of MEDLINE (1966-1998)
              and EMBASE (1974-1998). Additionally, all available data from the
              Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the
              Chiropractic Research Archives Collection, and the Manual,
              Alternative, and Natural Therapies Information System were used,
              as well as material gathered through the citation tracking, and
              hand searching of non-indexed chiropractic, osteopathic, and
              manual medicine journals. DATA EXTRACTION:Information about
              outcome measures, interventions and effect sizes was used to
              evaluate treatment efficacy. Levels of evidence were determined
              by a classification system incorporating study validity and
              statistical significance of study results. Two authors
              independently extracted data and performed methodological scoring
              of selected trials. DATA SYNTHESIS:Nine trials involving 683
              patients with chronic headache were included. The methodological
              quality (validity) scores ranged from 21 to 87 (100-point scale).
              The trials were too heterogeneous in terms of patient clinical
              characteristic, control groups, and outcome measures to warrant
              statistical pooling. Based on predefined criteria, there is
              moderate evidence that SMT has short-term efficacy similar to
              amitriptyline in the prophylactic treatment of chronic
              tension-type headache and migraine. SMT does not appear to
              improve outcomes when added to soft-tissue massage for episodic
              tension-type headache. There is moderate evidence that SMT is
              more efficacious than massage for cervicogenic headache.
              Sensitivity analyses showed that the results and the overall
              study conclusions remained the same even when substantial changes
              in the prespecified assumptions/rules regarding the evidence
              determination were applied. CONCLUSIONS:SMT appears to have a
              better effect than massage for cervicogenic headache. It also
              appears that SMT has an effect comparable to commonly used
              first-line prophylactic prescription medications for tension-type
              headache and migraine headache. This conclusion rests upon a few
              trials of adequate methodological quality. Before any firm
              conclusions can be drawn, further testing should be done in
              rigorously designed, executed, and analyzed trials with follow-up
              periods of sufficient length.",

               investigated for this patient population, the specific effects
               of these treatments have not been reported. The purpose of this
               investigational study is to report the immediate effects of
               thoracic spine and rib manipulation in patients with primary
               complaints of shoulder pain. Using a test-retest design, 21
               subjects with shoulder pain were treated during a single
               treatment session with high-velocity thrust manipulation to the
               thoracic spine or upper ribs. Post-treatment effects
               demonstrated a 51\% (32mm) reduction in shoulder pain, a
               corresponding increase in shoulder range of motion (30 degrees
               -38 degrees ), and a mean patient-perceived global rating of
               change of 4.2 (median 5). These immediate post-treatment results
               suggest that thoracic and rib manipulative therapy is associated
               with improved shoulder pain and motion in patients with shoulder
               pain, and further these interventions support the concept of a
               regional interdependence between the thoracic spine, upper ribs,
               and shoulder.",

               thoracic spine thrust manipulations (TSTMs) on patients with
               shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS). There is evidence that
               manual physical therapy that includes TSTM and non-thrust
               manipulation and exercise is effective for the treatment of
               patients with SIS. However, the relative contributions of
               specific manual therapy interventions are not known. To date, no
               published studies address the short-term effects of TSTM in the
               treatment of SIS. Fifty-six patients (40 males, 16 females; mean
               age 31.2+/-8.9) with SIS underwent a standardized shoulder
               examination, immediately followed by TSTM techniques. Outcomes
               measured were the Numeric Pain and Rating Scale (NPRS) and the
               Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), all collected at
               baseline and at a 48-h follow-up period. Additionally, the

              sport participation. The identifying feature of plyometric
              exercise is a lengthening of the muscle-tendon unit followed
              directly by shortening (stretch-shortening cycle). Numerous
              plyometric exercises with varied difficulty and demand on the
              musculoskeletal system can be implemented in rehabilitation.
              Plyometric exercises are initiated at a lower intensity and
              progressed to more difficult, higher intensity levels. The
              progression to higher-intensity plyometric exercise is thought to
              resolve postinjury neuromuscular impairments and to prepare the
              musculoskeletal system for rapid movements and high forces that
              may be similar to the demands imposed during sport participation,
              thus assisting the athlete with a return to full function. While

               years and the inter-rater reliability of the assessment has been
               previously established for therapists at this level of training.
               Prior studies identifying the classification of patients
               according to syndrome and directional preference have been
               mainly for the lumbar spine. The 34 participants for this study
               each assessed and classified 10 consecutive spinal patients
               during a 10-week period. Of the 340 patients assessed, 19 were
               excluded. Of those with pain arising from the lumbar spine;
               140/187 were classified as reducible derangement syndrome,
               11/187 were classified as irreducible derangement, 11/187 as
               dysfunction syndrome, 1/187 as posture syndrome and 24/187 as

               retrospectively review the management of patients with lateral
               epicondylalgia, and to compare self-reported outcomes to assess
               the potential benefit of manual physical therapy to the cervical
               spine. BACKGROUND: It has been postulated that dysfunction of
               the cervical spine may contribute to the symptoms associated
               with lateral epicondylalgia; however, the literature assessing
               the effectiveness of manual physical therapy to the
               cervicothoracic region in this patient population has been
               inconclusive. Documentation and analysis of outcomes of
               management strategies focusing on the cervical spine may lead to
               determining the most effective and efficient clinical practices.
               METHODS AND MEASURES: Of the 213 charts reviewed, 112 satisfied
               inclusion-exclusion criteria and were divided into 2 groups:
               those who received treatment solely directed at the elbow (local
               management [LM]), or those who received treatment directed at
               the elbow and cervical manual therapy (LM+C). Telephone
               follow-up interviews were used to determine the number of
               successful outcomes. Percentages of successful outcomes in each
               group were compared using chi-square analysis. An independent
               samples t test was used to compare the total number of visits
               per group. RESULTS: Sixty-one of the 112 patients were in the LM
               group, while 51 received LM+C. Seventy five percent of the
               patients available for follow-up in the LM group and 80\% in the
               LM+C group reported a successful outcome. Patients in the LM
               group received a greater number of visits (mean, 9.7; SD, 2.4)
               than patients in the LM+C group (mean, 5.6; SD, 1.7; P<.01).
               CONCLUSIONS: The results of this retrospective review suggest
               that most patients had successful outcomes regardless of the
               inclusion of manual therapy interventions to the cervical spine.
               The LM+C group achieved the successful long-term outcome in
               significantly fewer visits.",

              this study was to investigate whether early lumbar disc
              degeneration (DD) in young low back pain (LBP) patients predicts
              progression of degenerative changes, pain, or disability in a
              30-year follow-up. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:MRI is an accurate
              method for studying degenerative changes in intervertebral discs.
              Decreased signal intensity (SI) can be used as indication of
              decreased water content. Long-term prognosis of early DD remains
              unclear. METHODS:In an earlier study, 75 conscripts aged 20 years
              with LBP had their lumbar spine examined by MRI. At a follow-up
              of 30 years, the subjects were contacted; 35 of 69 filled a pain
              and disability questionnaire, and 26 of 35 were also reexamined
              clinically and by MRI. The images were evaluated for decreased SI
              and other degenerative changes. Association between decreased SI
              of a disc at baseline and the presence of more severe
              degenerative changes in the same disc space at follow-up was
              analyzed using Fisher exact test. Association between decreased
              baseline SI and pain/disability scores from the questionnaire was
              analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis H test. RESULTS:The total number of
              lumbar discs with decreased SI increased from 23 of 130 (18\%) to
              92 of 130 (71\%)-from 0.9 to 3.5 per subject during the
              follow-up. Distribution of DD changed from being mostly in L4-L5
              and L5-S1 discs to being almost even between the four lowermost
              discs. Discs that had even slightly decreased SI at baseline were
              more likely to have severely decreased SI at follow-up, compared
              to healthy discs (57\% vs. 11\%, P < 0.001). Other degenerative
              changes were also more common in these discs. Severity of DD at
              baseline did not have a significant association with current pain
              or disability. CONCLUSION:In young LBP patients, early
              degeneration in lumbar discs predicts progressive degenerative
              changes in the respective discs, but not pain, disability, or
              clinical symptoms. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:4.",

  abstract = "Chondral defects of the articular surface pose a challenging
              problem to the orthopedic surgeon. The goal of surgery is to
              alleviate pain, maximize function, and prevent degenerative
              changes in the future. A number of techniques have been described
              to treat these lesions. When considering the treatment options
              for chondral defects, the surgeon must consider the size, depth,
              location, and chronicity of the lesion. In addition, the overall
              alignment of the joint must be evaluated. Prior to treating
              chondral defects, it is important to understand the indications
              and contraindications for the microfracture technique. When
              indicated, the microfracture technique has many advantages over
              other surgical options. This technique is relatively easy to
              perform, cost effective, and has low patient morbidity. In
              addition, the microfracture technique does not burn any long-term
              bridges, enabling the surgeon to choose a different procedure to
              revise the chondral defect if the microfracture fails. It is
              important to understand the mechanism of healing by
              microfracture, including the effects of the local environment.
              The postoperative protocol used after the procedure may be as
              important as the surgery itself. Understanding the science behind
              the microfracture procedure will lead to better surgical
              technique and improved outcomes.",

  abstract  = "Background:In the United States, low back pain (LBP) is among
               the most common symptoms prompting a health care visit. Patients
               can receive escalated care, such as advanced imaging or invasive
               procedures, before guideline-recommended options offered by
               physical therapists. A guideline-concordant alternative care
               pathway (RapidAccess) that emphasized early physical therapy for
               patients with LBP before they consulted a physiatrist was
               implemented. Evaluating the implementation of care pathways,
               such as RapidAccess using the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness,
               adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework, provides a
               broader understanding of the barriers to implementation.
               Objective:The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
               implementation of a guideline-concordant care pathway for
               patients with LBP using a RE-AIM framework. Design:This study
               used a prospective observational cohort design. Methods:Patients
               with a chief complaint of LBP who were scheduling a new
               appointment with physiatry were eligible. Eligible patients
               chose whether or not to participate in RapidAccess before a
               consultation with a physiatrist. Implementation outcomes were
               evaluated using the RE-AIM framework. Results:During the study
               period, 1556 patients with LBP called to schedule a new visit
               with a physiatrist. Of these, 400 (25.7\%) were eligible for
               RapidAccess, and 124 (31\% of those eligible) participated in
               the program (reach). Of the 400 eligible patients, 225 (56.3\%)
               were offered RapidAccess (adoption). Compared with patients who
               were managed in physical therapy following a consultation with a
               physiatrist, RapidAccess participants demonstrated improvement
               in physical function with physical therapist management
               (effectiveness); 58.9\% cancelled their physiatrist visit
               (implementation), and rates of imaging and injections were lower
               (effectiveness). Reach and adoption (maintenance) trended
               downward beyond the first 6 months of the project.
               Limitations:The results are from a single health system and
               might not be broadly generalizable. Conclusions:The RE-AIM
               framework was useful in evaluating the implementation of
               RapidAccess. Factors influencing reach and adoption must be
               further examined.",

               studies, confounding variables such as age, gender, height,
               obesity, and pain level were usually not well controlled. The
               present study aimed to compare LROM and lumbar lordosis between
               back pain patients and matched controls. Fifteen male back pain
               patients and 15 age-, height-, obesity-, and physical
               activity-matched male controls were investigated. To minimize
               the effect of pain on the measurements, only patients with
               minimal or no pain at the time technique was used for the
               evaluation of LROM in flexion, extension and lateral flexion as
               well as lumbar lordosis. A lumbar rotameter was used for
               measuring axial rotation. Pelvic motion was limited by a pelvic

              abnormal gait and spinal sagittal alignment and is associated
              with LBP. METHODS:All consecutive adults scheduled for THR in our
              department due to severe hip osteoarthritis were assessed by an
              independent investigator before surgery and 3 months and 2 years
              post-THR. The Harris Hip Score and the Oswestry scores were used
              to evaluate hip- and spine-related symptoms, respectively, as
              were visual analogue scales (VAS) and sagittal spinal
              radiographs. RESULTS:Twenty-five patients (10 males; age range,
              32-84 years) were evaluated. Both spinal and hip pain and
              function were significantly better following THR. The mean
              preoperative LBP VAS score of 5.04 was 3.68 after THR (P =
              0.006). The mean preoperative Oswestry score of 36.72 was 24.08
              after THR (P = 0.0011). Clinical improvement was maintained and
              enhanced at the 2-year follow-up. The mean hip pain VAS score was
              7.08 before THR and 2.52 after THR (P < 0.01). The mean Harris
              Hip Score was 45.74 before and 81.8 after surgery (P < 0.01).
              There were no changes in the radiographic measurements.
              CONCLUSION:Both LBP and spinal function were improved following
              THR. This study demonstrates the clinical benefits of THR on back
              pain and is the first to clinically validate hip-spine syndrome

               rehabilitation of patients after arthroscopic rotator cuff
               repair. The overarching philosophy of rehabilitation is centered
               on the principle of the gradual application of controlled
               stresses to the healing rotator cuff repair with consideration
               of rotator cuff tear size, tissue quality, and patient
               variables. This statement describes a rehabilitation framework
               that includes a 2-week period of strict immobilization and a
               staged introduction of protected, passive range of motion during
               weeks 2-6 postoperatively, followed by restoration of active
               range of motion, and then progressive strengthening beginning at
               postoperative week 12. When appropriate, rehabilitation
               continues with a functional progression for return to athletic

              in injured muscle, how massage affects cellular function remains
              unknown. To assess the effects of massage, we administered either
              massage therapy or no treatment to separate quadriceps of 11
              young male participants after exercise-induced muscle damage.
              Muscle biopsies were acquired from the quadriceps (vastus
              lateralis) at baseline, immediately after 10 min of massage
              treatment, and after a 2.5-hour period of recovery. We found that
              massage activated the mechanotransduction signaling pathways
              focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and extracellular signal-regulated
              kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), potentiated mitochondrial biogenesis

              cytokines tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$) and
              interleukin-6 (IL-6) and reduced heat shock protein 27 (HSP27)
              phosphorylation, thereby mitigating cellular stress resulting
              from myofiber injury. In summary, when administered to skeletal
              muscle that has been acutely damaged through exercise, massage

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE:The purpose of this study was to compare the findings
              on hip MR arthrography (MRA) with the published MRA and
              arthroscopic classifications of hip labral tears and to evaluate
              a clock-face method for localizing hip labral tears.
              DESIGN/PATIENTS:We retrospectively reviewed 65 hip MRA studies
              with correlative hip arthroscopies. Each labrum was evaluated on
              MRA using the classification system of Czerny and an MRA
              modification of the Lage arthroscopic classification. In
              addition, each tear was localized on MRA by using a clock-face
              description where 6 o'clock was the transverse ligament and 3
              o'clock was anterior. These MRA findings were then correlated
              with the arthroscopic findings using the clock-face method of
              localization and the Lage arthroscopic classification of labral
              tears. RESULTS:At MRA, there were 42 Czerny grade 2 and 23 grade
              3 labral tears and 22 MRA Lage type 1, 11 type 2, 22 type 3 and
              10 type 4 tears. At arthroscopy, there were 10 Lage type 1 flap
              tears, 20 Lage type 2 fibrillated tears, 18 Lage type 3
              longitudinal peripheral tears and 17 Lage type 4 unstable tears.
              The Czerny MRA classification and the modified MRA Lage
              classification had borderline correlation with the arthroscopic
              Lage classification. Localization of the tears using a clock-face
              description was within 1 o'clock of the arthroscopic localization
              of the tears in 85\% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS:The Lage
              classification, which is the only published arthroscopic
              classification system for hip labral tears, does not correlate
              well with the Czerny MRA or an MRA modification of the Lage
              classification. Using a clock-face description to localize tears
              provides a way to accurately localize a labral tear and define
              its extent.",

              analgesia within supraspinal regions, including the basal
              ganglia, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus and
              periaqueductal gray. In addition, while the participation of
              serotonin and norepinephrine in spinal descending inhibition of
              pain is well known, a critical role for dopamine in descending
              inhibition has also been demonstrated. Decreased levels of
              dopamine likely contribute to the painful symptoms that
              frequently occur in Parkinson's disease. Moreover, abnormalities
              in dopaminergic neurotransmission have been objectively
              demonstrated in painful clinical conditions, including burning
              mouth syndrome, fibromyalgia and restless legs syndrome. Evidence
              from animal models and indirect evidence from pharmaceutical
              trials also suggest a role for dopamine in chronic regional pain
              syndrome and painful diabetic neuropathy. Several novel classes
              of medication with analgesic properties have bearing on
              dopaminergic activity as evident in the capacity of dopamine
              antagonists to attenuate their analgesic capacity. An expanded
              appreciation for the role of dopamine in natural analgesia

  abstract = "BACKGROUND:Evidence exists that conservative rehabilitation
              protocols fail to achieve full recovery of muscle strength and
              function after joint injuries. The lack of success has been
              attributed to the high amount of muscle inhibition found in
              patients with pathologic conditions of the knee joint. Clinical
              evaluation shows that anterior knee pain is typically associated
              with sacroiliac joint dysfunction, which may contribute to the
              muscle inhibition observed in this patient group. OBJECTIVE:To
              assess whether sacroiliac joint manipulation alters muscle
              inhibition and strength of the knee extensor muscles in patients
              with anterior knee pain. DESIGN AND SETTING:The effects of
              sacroiliac joint manipulation were evaluated in patients with
              anterior knee pain. The manipulation consisted of a high-velocity
              low-amplitude thrust in the side-lying position aimed at
              correcting sacroiliac joint dysfunction. Before and after the
              manipulation, torque, muscle inhibition, and muscle activation
              for the knee extensor muscles were measured during isometric
              contractions using a Cybex dynamometer, muscle stimulation, and
              electromyography, respectively. PARTICIPANTS:Eighteen patients
              (mean age, 30.5 +/- 13.0 years) with either unilateral (n = 14)
              or bilateral (n = 4) anterior knee pain. RESULTS:Patients showed
              substantial muscle inhibition in the involved and the
              contralateral legs as estimated by the interpolated twitch
              technique. After the manipulation, a decrease in muscle
              inhibition and increases in knee extensor torques and muscle
              activation were observed, particularly in the involved leg. In
              patients with bilateral anterior knee pain, muscle inhibition was
              decreased in both legs after sacroiliac joint adjustment.
              CONCLUSIONS:Spinal manipulation might offer an interesting

               quality-of-life-related health problem. Microdiscectomy is often
               the surgical procedure of choice for a symptomatic,
               single-level, lumbar disc herniation in younger and middle-aged
               adults. The question of whether a post-microdiscectomy exercise
               program enhances function, quality of life, and disability
               status has not been systematically explored. Thus, the overall
               purpose of this study is to assess immediate and long-term
               outcomes of an exercise program, developed at University of
               Southern California (USC), targeting the trunk and lower
               extremities (USC Spine Exercise Program) for persons who have
               undergone a single-level microdiscectomy for the first time.
               METHODS/DESIGN: One hundred individuals between the ages of 18
               and 60 who consent to undergo lumbar microdiscectomy will be
               recruited to participate in this study. Subjects will be
               randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) one session of back
               care education, or 2) a back care education session followed by
               the 12-week USC Spine Exercise Program. The outcome examiners
               (evaluators), as well as the data managers, will be blinded to
               group allocation. Education will consist of a one-hour
               ``one-on-one'' session with the intervention therapist, guided
               by an educational booklet specifically designed for
               post-microdiscectomy care. This session will occur four to six
               weeks after surgery. The USC Spine Exercise Program consists of
               two parts: back extensor strength and endurance, and mat and
               upright therapeutic exercises. This exercise program is
               goal-oriented, performance-based, and periodized. It will begin
               two to three days after the education session, and will occur
               three times a week for 12 weeks. Primary outcome measures
               include the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, Roland-Morris
               Disability Questionnaire, SF-36 quality of life assessment,
               Subjective Quality of Life Scale, 50-foot Walk, Repeated
               Sit-to-Stand, and a modified Sorensen test. The outcome measures
               in the study will be assessed before and after the 12-week
               post-surgical intervention program. Long-term follow up
               assessments will occur every six months beginning one year after
               surgery and ending five years after surgery. Immediate and
               long-term effects will be assessed using repeated measures
               multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). If significant
               interactions are found, one-way ANOVAs will be performed
               followed by post-hoc testing to determine statistically
               significant pairwise comparisons. DISCUSSION: We have presented

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:Existing osteoarthritis (OA) care models
               often fall short in addressing the many biological,
               psychological, social, and behavioral characteristics that
               contribute to disability. As US health care shifts towards
               value-based payment, there is an increasing need to develop and
               test scalable, cost-effective, and multi-modal OA care models.
               This administrative case report will describe the development
               and pilot of a new, value-based comprehensive care model for OA.
               CASE DESCRIPTION:The Joint Health Program (JHP) is a physical
               therapist-led conservative care model for individuals with hip
               and knee OA. In the JHP, physical therapists with specialized
               training in cognitive behavioral-theory based strategy function
               as the central care provider (ie, the primary osteoarthritis
               provider) who delivers evidence-based, psychologically informed
               interventions and coordinates care within a multi-disciplinary
               network of dietitians, behavioral health specialists, and
               orthopedic providers. The JHP is focused on enhancing patient
               engagement, shared decision making, self-management and
               multi-modal patient interaction, and long-term follow-up.
               OUTCOMES:A value-based, comprehensive care program for OA led by
               physical therapists demonstrated feasibility and acceptability
               within a large, academic health care system, which has led to
               its early growth. Barriers to development and integration of the
               program were addressed through effective collaboration among
               health care providers, program and health system administrators,
               and executive leadership. DISCUSSION:The JHP serves as a model
               for future physical therapist-led, value-based care models that
               could be developed in other health care systems for OA and other
               chronic conditions. Future work will identify characteristics
               that predict program response and compare the effectiveness of
               this program to existing models of care.",

               subjects both with and without neck pain and to determine
               whether there was a difference in neck flexor muscle endurance
               between the 2 groups. SUBJECTS:Forty-one subjects with and
               without neck pain were enrolled in this repeated-measures
               reliability study. METHODS:Two raters used an isometric neck
               retraction test to assess neck flexor muscle endurance for all
               subjects during an initial session, and subjects without neck
               pain returned for testing 1 week later. RESULTS:For the group
               without neck pain, intrarater reliability was good to excellent
               (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC(3,1)]=.82-.91), and
               interrater reliability was moderate to good (ICC[2,1]=.67-.78).
               The associated standard error of measurement (SEM) ranged from
               8.0 to 11.0 seconds and from 12.6 to 15.3 seconds, respectively.
               For the group with neck pain, interrater reliability was
               moderate (ICC[2,1]=.67, SEM=11.5). Neck flexor muscle endurance
               test results for the group without neck pain (mean=38.95

               groups and ranged from moderate to excellent and improved after
               the first test session. The interrater reliability of data
               obtained with the neck flexor muscle endurance test in people
               with neck pain must be improved in order for clinicians to
               distinguish a clinically meaningful change from measurement
               error. Neck flexor muscle endurance was both statistically and
               clinically greater for subjects without neck pain than for those

              relapsing large-joint oligoarthritis can persist for years, yet
              subside with appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Nervous system
              involvement occurs in 10\%-15\% of untreated patients and
              typically involves lymphocytic meningitis, cranial neuritis,
              and/or mononeuritis multiplex; in some rare cases, patients have
              parenchymal inflammation in the brain or spinal cord. Nervous
              system infection is similarly highly responsive to antimicrobial
              therapy, including oral doxycycline. Nonspecific symptoms such as
              fatigue, perceived cognitive slowing, headache, and others occur
              in patients with Lyme disease and are indistinguishable from
              comparable symptoms occurring in innumerable other inflammatory

              treatment, although this may take time. Chronic fatigue states
              have been reported to occur following any number of infections,

               often poorly documented. The aim of this cadaveric biomechanical
               study was to measure longitudinal excursion and strain in the
               median and ulnar nerve at the wrist and proximal to the elbow
               during different types of nerve gliding exercises. The results
               confirmed the clinical assumption that 'sliding techniques'
               result in a substantially larger excursion of the nerve than
               'tensioning techniques' (e.g., median nerve at the wrist: 12.6
               versus 6.1mm, ulnar nerve at the elbow: 8.3 versus 3.8mm), and
               that this larger excursion is associated with a much smaller
               change in strain (e.g., median nerve at the wrist: 0.8\%
               (sliding) versus 6.8\% (tensioning)). The findings demonstrate
               that different types of nerve gliding exercises have largely
               different mechanical effects on the peripheral nervous system.
               Hence different types of techniques should not be regarded as

               to assess knowledge in musculoskeletal medicine among medical
               students, physician interns and residents, and across a variety
               of physician specialties. RESULTS: Experienced physical
               therapists had higher levels of knowledge in managing
               musculoskeletal conditions than medical students, physician
               interns and residents, and all physician specialists except for
               orthopaedists. Physical therapist students enrolled in doctoral
               degree educational programs achieved significantly higher scores
               than their peers enrolled in master's degree programs.
               Furthermore, experienced physical therapists who were
               board-certified in orthopaedic or sports physical therapy
               achieved significantly higher scores and passing rates than
               their non board-certified colleagues. CONCLUSION: The results of
               this study may have implications for health and public policy
               decisions regarding the suitability of utilizing physical
               therapists to provide direct access care for patients with

  abstract = "BACKGROUND:The physician-patient interview is the key component
              of all health care, particularly of primary medical care. This
              review sought to evaluate existing primary-care-based research
              studies to determine which verbal and nonverbal behaviors on the
              part of the physician during the medical encounter have been
              linked in empirical studies with favorable patient outcomes.
              METHODS:We reviewed the literature from 1975 to 2000 for studies
              of office interactions between primary care physicians and
              patients that evaluated these interactions empirically using
              neutral observers who coded observed encounters, videotapes, or
              audiotapes. Each study was reviewed for the quality of the
              methods and to find statistically significant relations between
              specific physician behaviors and patient outcomes. In examining
              nonverbal behaviors, because of a paucity of clinical outcome
              studies, outcomes were expanded to include associations with
              patient characteristics or subjective ratings of the interaction
              by observers. RESULTS:We found 14 studies of verbal communication
              and 8 studies of nonverbal communication that met inclusion
              criteria. Verbal behaviors positively associated with health
              outcomes included empathy, reassurance and support, various
              patient-centered questioning techniques, encounter length,
              history taking, explanations, both dominant and passive physician
              styles, positive reinforcement, humor, psychosocial talk, time in
              health education and information sharing, friendliness, courtesy,
              orienting the patient during examination, and summarization and
              clarification. Nonverbal behaviors positively associated with
              outcomes included head nodding, forward lean, direct body
              orientation, uncrossed legs and arms, arm symmetry, and less
              mutual gaze. CONCLUSION:Existing research is limited because of
              lack of consensus of what to measure, conflicting findings, and
              relative lack of empirical studies (especially of nonverbal
              behavior). Nonetheless, medical educators should focus on
              teaching and reinforcing behaviors known to be facilitative, and
              to continue to understand further how physician behavior can
              enhance favorable patient outcomes, such as understanding and
              adherence to medical regimens and overall satisfaction.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND:Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is currently one of the
              most common disorders of the digestive system in the Western
              society. Almost 2 out of 10 people suffer from IBS with women
              being more affected than men. IBS is associated with abdominal
              pain, bloating and altered stool consistency and imposes a heavy
              burden for the affected patients. SUMMARY:The pathophysiology of
              IBS remains elusive although potential causes have been
              suggested, such as a deranged brain-gut signaling,
              hypersensitivity of visceral sensory afferent fibers, bacterial
              gastroenteritis, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO),
              genetic alterations and food sensitivity. Targets for the
              pharmacotherapy of IBS include the serotonergic and opioidergic
              system, and the microbial population of the gut. Alternative
              therapies like traditional Chinese medicine have shown some
              success in the combat against IBS. Key Messages: Many
              therapeutics for the treatment of IBS have emerged in the past;
              however, only a few have met up with the expectations in larger
              clinical trials. Additionally, the multifactorial etiology of IBS
              and its variety of cardinal symptoms requires an individual set
              of therapeutics. This review provides a short overview of
              potential causes and current pharmacological therapeutics and of
              additional and alternative therapies for IBS.",

               closely related to the mechanism of central sensitization,
               characterized by low-grade neuroinflammation, and commonly
               associated with stress or anxiety; in addition, it often does

               the predictive validity of variables from the initial
               examination to identify patients with neck pain who are likely
               to benefit from thoracic spine thrust manipulation. The purpose
               of this study was to develop a clinical prediction rule (CPR) to
               identify patients with neck pain who are likely to experience
               early success from thoracic spine thrust manipulation. SUBJECTS:
               This was a prospective, cohort study of patients with mechanical
               neck pain who were referred for physical therapy. METHODS:
               Subjects underwent a standardized examination and then a series
               of thoracic spine thrust manipulation techniques. They were
               classified as having experienced a successful outcome at the
               second and third sessions based on their perceived recovery.
               Potential predictor variables were entered into a stepwise
               logistic regression model to determine the most accurate set of
               variables for prediction of treatment success. RESULTS: Data for
               78 subjects were included in the data analysis, of which 42 had
               a successful outcome. A CPR with 6 variables was identified. If
               3 of the 6 variables (positive likelihood ratio=5.5) were
               present, the chance of experiencing a successful outcome
               improved from 54\% to 86\%. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The CPR
               provides the ability to a priori identify patients with neck
               pain who are likely to experience early success with thoracic
               spine thrust manipulation. However, future studies are necessary

               1 of 14 CSMC test conditions (balance with torsion and eyes
               open), and neck disability was associated with balance with eyes
               open and high-load head steadiness. Other factors, including
               sex, age, body mass index, physical activity levels, and neck
               pain duration, showed no association with CSMC.
               LIMITATIONS:Although all other tests involved computerized data
               collection, the joint position error test was administered
               manually, introducing the risk of researcher bias.
               CONCLUSIONS:The few associations between test conditions and
               neck pain characteristics were at best weak; hence, these are
               likely to be chance findings. These results suggest that CSMC
               may not be associated with improvement/worsening of chronic
               idiopathic neck pain, spawning debate on the clinical usefulness
               of CSMC tests.",

               Therapy (ACAPT) developed 3 strategic initiative panels to
               address integrated clinical education, student readiness, and
               common terminology for physical therapist clinical education.
               Objective:The purpose of this paper is to describe the results
               of the work from the Common Terminology Panel. Design:This was a
               descriptive, consensus-based study. Methods:Using a consensus
               process and data that were collected from a review of
               literature, a document analysis of core and historical
               professional documents, focus group discussions, and an online
               open comment period, panel members developed a glossary for
               physical therapist clinical education. Results:The final
               glossary included 34 terms in 4 categories. The categories
               included clinical education infrastructure, sites, stakeholders,
               and assessment. The ACAPT Board of Directors approved the
               glossary in June 2017, and the ACAPT membership approved the
               glossary in October 2017. Limitations:The focus of the glossary
               was on physical therapist clinical education. A future, similar
               project should be undertaken for physical therapist assistant
               clinical education. Conclusion:This process resulted in a
               comprehensive glossary for physical therapist clinical
               education; changes to several current terms, including
               ``internship'' and ``full-time clinical education experience'';
               and the addition of new terms, including ``preceptor'' and
               ``site coordinator for clinical education.'' New terminology
               will provide standard language for consistent communication and
               a common framework for all stakeholders.",

              In addition, the relation between cortisol concentrations and
              cognitive performance will be studied in patients with chronic
              WAD. Thirty-one subjects, 16 healthy subjects and 15 patients
              with chronic WAD, were enrolled and subjected to several
              self-report and physiological measures. Self-report measures
              encompassed pain rating during a procedure evaluating conditioned
              pain modulation. Afterward, they were subjected to physiological
              measures, which are cognitive tests (Stroop task, psychomotor
              vigilance task, and operation span task) preceded and followed by
              salivary cortisol concentration measurements. Chronic WAD

  abstract  = "Chronic pain is often associated with reduced tactile acuity. A
               relationship exists between pain intensity, tactile acuity and
               cortical reorganisation. When pain resolves, tactile function
               improves and cortical organisation normalises. Tactile acuity
               can be improved in healthy controls when tactile stimulation is
               associated with a behavioural objective. We hypothesised that,
               in patients with chronic limb pain and decreased tactile acuity,
               discriminating between tactile stimuli would decrease pain and
               increase tactile acuity, but tactile stimulation alone would
               not. Thirteen patients with complex regional pain syndrome
               (CRPS) of one limb underwent a waiting period and then
               approximately 2 weeks of tactile stimulation under two
               conditions: stimulation alone or discrimination between stimuli
               according to their diameter and location. There was no change in
               pain (100 mm VAS) or two-point discrimination (TPD) during a
               no-treatment waiting period, nor during the stimulation phase (p
               > 0.32 for both). Pain and TPD were lower after the
               discrimination phase [mean (95\% CI) effect size for pain VAS =
               27 mm (14-40 mm) and for TPD = 5.7 mm (2.9-8. ), p < 0.015 for
               both]. These gains were maintained at three-month follow-up. We
               conclude that tactile stimulation can decrease pain and increase
               tactile acuity when patients are required to discriminate
               between the type and location of tactile stimuli.",

               clinical reasoning. A model of the clinical reasoning process
               for physical therapists is presented to bring attention to the
               hypothesis generation, testing, and modification that I feel
               should take place through all aspects of the patient encounter.
               Examples of common errors in clinical reasoning are highlighted,

              this hypothesis, 20 patients with mild to moderate CTS were
              randomly allocated to either night splinting or a home program of
              nerve and tendon gliding exercises. Magnetic resonance images of
              the wrist were taken at baseline, immediately after 10 min of
              splinting or exercise, and following 1 week of intervention.
              Primary outcome measures were signal intensity of the median
              nerve at the wrist as a measure of intraneural edema and palmar
              bowing of the carpal ligament. Secondary outcome measures were
              changes in symptom severity and function. Following 1 week of
              intervention, but not immediately after 10 min, signal intensity
              of the median nerve was reduced by $\approx$ 11\% at the

               widely used by physical therapists for making decisions about
               the vigor of examination and treatment, but this construct has
               not been defined to the extent that its measurement properties
               can be tested. The purposes of this study were to 1) determine
               if physical therapists utilize low back pain (LBP) irritability
               judgments to make treatment decisions, 2) identify LBP
               characteristics appropriate for an LBP irritability construct,
               and 3) develop a measurement construct of LBP irritability.
               Physical therapists evaluated and treated 183 subjects with LBP.
               The therapists judged the subjects' LBP as irritable or
               non-irritable, and recorded treatments provided at the initial
               visit. A principal-components analysis (PCA) was performed on 14
               patient-reported LBP characteristics to identify potential
               components of a measurement construct of LBP irritability. The
               therapists' irritability judgments were found to be associated
               with the types of treatments prescribed. Five dimensions of LBP
               irritability were identified by the PCA from the 14 LBP
               characteristics considered. Four of these dimensions were
               associated with the therapists' LBP irritability judgments. The
               Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, presence of distal
               symptoms, and forward bending tolerance were found to have a
               stronger association with the irritability judgments than the
               dimensions of irritability identified in this study. Validated
               measures of LBP characteristics in current clinical use may

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND:Residency training is recognized as a valuable form
               of professional development and pathway to specialization.
               Currently residency is voluntary for physical therapists, with
               less than 12\% of DPT students choosing to apply upon
               graduation. Motivations that drive the decision to pursue
               residency are currently unknown as is the extent of similarity
               and difference in perspective among various stakeholders.
               OBJECTIVE:The purpose of this study was to identify the dominant
               perspectives on motivations to pursue residency held by various
               stakeholders. DESIGN:This study was conducted using Q
               Methodology, which incorporates aspects of quantitative and
               qualitative techniques into the examination of human
               subjectivity. METHODS:Program directors, faculty, and current
               residents from all accredited physical therapy residency
               programs were invited to complete a forced-choice sorting
               activity where potential motivations for residency were sorted
               by perceived level of importance. Principal component analysis
               was used to identify dominant perspectives, which were
               interpreted based on emergent themes in the cluster of
               motivations identified as most important. RESULTS:Four dominant
               perspectives were identified: (1) desire to provide better
               patient care, (2) preparation for specialty practice, (3) fast
               track to expert practice, and (4) career advancement. These
               perspectives provided context and utility to 2 broad
               meta-motivations: improved clinical reasoning and receiving
               mentoring. Both within- and between-group differences among
               stakeholders were identified. However, subsets from each
               role-group population were found to share similar perspectives.
               LIMITATIONS:Results from this study may not apply to potential
               residents in all specialty areas, and the implications of having
               a particular perspective are unknown. CONCLUSIONS:Identification
               of the dominant perspective on motivations for pursuing
               residency may aid in promoting participation, program
               development, matching residents to programs and mentors, and

              Isometric Test (HipSIT) evaluates the strength of the hip
              posterolateral stabilizers in a position that favors greater
              activation of the gluteus maximus and gluteus medius and lower
              activation of the tensor fascia lata. Objectives To check the
              validity and reliability of the HipSIT and to evaluate the HipSIT
              in women with patellofemoral pain (PFP). Methods The HipSIT was
              evaluated with a handheld dynamometer. During testing, the
              participants were sidelying, with their legs positioned at 45° of
              hip flexion and 90° of knee flexion. Participants were instructed
              to raise the knee of the upper leg while keeping the upper and
              lower heels in contact. To establish reliability and validity, 49
              women were tested with the HipSIT by 2 different evaluators on
              day 1, and then again 7 days later. The strength of the hip
              extensors, abductors, and external rotators was also evaluated.
              Twenty women with unilateral PFP were also evaluated. Results The
              HipSIT has excellent intrarater and interrater reliability. The
              standard error of measurement was 0.01 kgf/kg, and the minimal
              detectable change was 0.036 kgf/kg. The HipSIT showed good
              validity in isolated hip abduction, external rotation, and
              extension (P<.01). Women with PFP showed a 10\% deficit in the
              HipSIT results for the symptomatic limb (P = .01). Conclusion The
              HipSIT showed excellent interrater and intrarater reliability,

               change as a result of an evidence-based educational programme?",
  author    = "Stevenson, Kay and Lewis, Martyn and Hay, Elaine",
  abstract  = "RATIONALE:The concept of evidence-based practice (EBP)
               encourages health care professionals to provide the most
               effective health care, and to be accountable for the
               interventions they provide. Little work has been undertaken to
               examine how practically allied health professionals' encompass
               EBP and how they perceptive and understand the concept of EBP.
               The use of opinion leaders to disseminate new evidence into
               practice, and thereby encourage the behaviour of health care
               professionals has been proposed. AIMS:The aims of this study
               were to investigate physiotherapists' attitudes towards EBP and
               to examine change in their attitudes following an education
               package, which utilized local opinion leaders. METHOD:Thirty
               musculoskeletal physiotherapists from a Community Trust in North
               Staffordshire were cluster randomized by location of work to two
               groups. The intervention group received an evidence-based
               programme on aspects of EBP including literature searching and
               critical appraisal. The attention control group received a
               standard in-service training package on the management of common
               knee pathologies. The physiotherapists' attitudes towards EBP
               were measured at baseline (before randomization) and at 3 and 6
               months follow-up. RESULTS:Physiotherapists reported that they
               primarily relied on 'courses' and 'in-service training' for
               informing their clinical practice. Most agreed that clinical
               practice should be based on the best available evidence and that
               they would change their clinical practice if evidence suggested
               they should do so. However, many of the physiotherapists
               reported difficulty in reading journals and could not identify
               opinion leaders in key areas. In terms of clinical practice,
               literature, journals and research were ascribed low priority
               throughout. Differences in attitudes between the intervention
               and control groups were observed in relation to management
               support for EBP at 3 and 6 months follow-up. CONCLUSIONS:In this
               study, physiotherapists appeared to be in favour of the idea of
               EBP, yet they remained reluctant to change their practice.
               Opinion leaders were not easily identifiable by
               physiotherapists, suggesting that this method alone may not be
               an effective method of changing attitudes in clinical practice.
               The process of changing attitudes in the clinical environment is
               a complex issue worthy of further research.",

              approach feature procedural and anatomical information, and these
              too have shown little effect on postoperative outcomes. This
              report describes the development of an evidence-based educational
              program and booklet for patients undergoing lumbar surgery for
              radiculopathy using a recently conducted systematic review of
              neuroscience education for musculoskeletal pain. The previous

              well as best-evidence synthesis of the content and delivery
              methods for neuroscience education for musculoskeletal pain.
              These evidence statements were extracted and developed into
              patient-centered messages and a booklet, which was then evaluated
              by peer and patient review. The neuroscience educational booklet
              and preoperative program convey key messages from the previous
              systematic review aimed at reducing fear and anxiety before
              surgery and assist in developing realistic expectations regarding
              pain after surgery. Key topics include the decision to undergo
              surgery, pain processing, peripheral nerve sensitization, effect
              of anxiety and stress on pain, surgery and the nervous system,
              and decreasing nerve sensitization. Feedback from the evaluations
              of the booklet and preoperative program was favorable from all

              treatment options in athletes with osteitis pubis and
              osteomyelitis pubis, attempting to determine which options
              provide optimal pain relief with rapid return to sport and
              prevention of symptom reoccurrence. METHODS:Three
              databases-MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and
              CINAHL-were searched using the OVID interface for all years
              between 1985 and May 2008. References were analysed from included
              studies, and additional relevant articles were obtained for
              inclusion. Inclusion criteria included (1) humans only, (2)
              subjects had no apparent risk factors for development of osteitis
              pubis or osteomyelitis of the pubic symphysis other than athletic
              involvement, (3) both physical exam findings and diagnostic
              imaging were used to confirm either diagnosis, and (4) a
              definitive treatment strategy was identifiable for management of
              osteitis pubis or osteomyelitis of the pubic symphysis. In total,
              25 articles were included in the review. RESULTS:There were no
              randomised controlled trials identified with this study's search
              strategy. A total of 195 athletes were diagnosed as having
              osteitis pubis (186 males, nine females) and treated with either
              conservative measures/physical therapy, local injection with
              corticosteroids and/or local anaesthetic, dextrose prolotherapy,
              surgery or antibiotic therapy. Six case reports/series described
              conservative treatment measures (physical therapy, rest,
              non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs). Four case series explored
              the use of corticosteroid injections in treatment. One case
              series described the use of dextrose prolotherapy as a treatment
              modality. Six case series described various surgical techniques
              (pubic symphysis curettage, polypropylene mesh placement and
              pubic bone stabilisation) in treatment. Ten case reports/series
              (10 subjects) outlined antibiotic treatment of osteomyelitis of
              the pubic symphysis. CONCLUSIONS:The current medical literature
              shows only level 4 evidence of the treatment for osteitis pubis
              in 24 case reports/series in athletes. Without any direct
              comparison of treatment modalities, it is difficult to determine
              which individual treatment option is the most efficacious.
              Further study comparing the different treatment options is
              necessary to determine which modality provides the fastest return

  abstract = "It is likely that patients with neck pain are not a homogeneous
              group, but, instead, consist of a variety of subgroups, each of
              which may benefit from a specific intervention matched to the
              patient's signs and symptoms. Studies to date have largely failed
              to account for this possibility, which may compromise the
              statistical power of research and ultimately fail to provide
              guidance for clinical decision making. Classification provides a
              means of breaking down a larger entity into more homogeneous
              subgroups of patients, based on examination data. Classification
              can guide the determination of a patient's prognosis, and the
              selection of the most appropriate intervention strategy.
              Classification has received considerable attention in the
              management of patients with low back pain, and evidence is
              emerging regarding its benefits. There has been considerably less
              effort made towards examining classification as it pertains to
              patients with neck pain. The purpose of this clinical commentary
              is to examine the current literature and to propose a
              classification system for patients with neck pain, based on the
              overall goal of treatment. The approach is based on published
              evidence when possible and is also informed by clinical
              experience and expert opinion. Classification decisions are based
              on the integration of data from a variety of information from the
              history and physical examination. The end result of the
              classification process is to determine the treatment approach
              believed to be most likely to maximize the clinical outcome for

               scores did not differ by pain region. The strongest contributor
               for all dependent variables was mSBT scores
               ($\beta$=|0.32|-|0.68|); higher mSBT scores were associated with
               poorer health status and self-efficacy and with higher levels of
               pain intensity, disability, kinesiophobia, catastrophizing, fear
               avoidance, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.
               LIMITATIONS:Generalizability was restricted to physical therapy
               outpatients with the included pain conditions. The mSBT used in
               this study is not ready for clinical implementation.
               CONCLUSIONS:The results of this study support the feasibility of
               using a single measure for concise risk assessment across
               different musculoskeletal pain conditions. Further longitudinal
               studies are needed to better direct the clinical use of an mSBT
               in people with low back, neck, shoulder, and knee pain.",

  author   = "Fitzgerald, G Kelley and Piva, Sara R and Irrgang, James J",
  abstract = "STUDY DESIGN:Randomized clinical trial, single-masked.
              OBJECTIVES:To determine the effectiveness of using a modified
              neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) training program as
              an adjunct treatment for improving quadriceps strength and
              physical function in rehabilitation following anterior cruciate
              ligament reconstruction (ACLR). BACKGROUND:NMES training for
              quadriceps strengthening has previously been shown to be an
              effective adjunct treatment following ACLR when performed against
              isometric resistance using a dynamometer with the knee positioned
              in flexion. We developed a modified version of published NMES
              protocol because some patients have difficulty tolerating the
              existing protocol and many clinics may not have instrumented
              dynamometers. There is a need to determine the effectiveness of
              this modified protocol. METHODS AND MEASURES:Forty-three subjects
              who had undergone ACLR were randomly assigned to either a group
              that received (NMES group) or did not receive (comparison group)
              the NMES treatment in conjunction with their rehabilitation.
              Group means for quadriceps strength and self-reported measures of
              knee function were compared after 12 and 16 weeks of
              rehabilitation. The proportion of subjects in each group
              achieving clinical criteria to initiate ambulation without
              crutches, treadmill running, and agility training at selected
              times during rehabilitation were also compared. RESULTS:The NMES
              group demonstrated moderately greater quadriceps strength at 12
              weeks (effect size, 0.48), and moderately higher levels of
              self-reported knee function at both 12 (effect size, 0.72) and 16
              (effect size, 0.65) weeks of rehabilitation compared to the
              comparison group. A greater proportion of subjects in the NMES
              group achieved clinical criteria for advancing to agility
              training at 16 weeks. CONCLUSIONS:The modified NMES quadriceps
              training protocol can be a useful adjunct to ACLR rehabilitation
              programs, but the treatment effect is smaller than what has been
              reported in previous studies.",

              generally mild, but definitive diagnosis requires invasive
              procedures. We analyzed a Mennonite kindred with an autosomal
              recessive form of GSD6 to determine the molecular defect and
              develop a non-invasive diagnostic test. Linkage analysis was
              performed using genetic markers flanking the liver glycogen
              phosphorylase gene ( PYGL ), which was suspected to be the cause
              of the disorder on biochemical grounds. Mennonite GSD6 was linked
              to the PYGL locus with a multipoint LOD score of 4.7. The PYGL
              gene was analyzed for mutations by sequencing genomic DNA.
              Sequencing of genomic DNA revealed a splice site abnormality of
              the intron 13 splice donor. Confirmation of the genomic mutation
              was performed by sequencing RT-PCR products, which showed
              heterogeneous PYGL mRNA lacking all or part of exon 13 in
              affected persons. This study is the first to demonstrate that a
              mutation in the PYGL gene can cause GSD6. This mutation is
              estimated to be present on 3\% of Mennonite chromosomes and the
              disease affects 0.1\% of that population. Determination of this
              mutation provides a basis for the development of a simple and
              non-invasive diagnostic test for the disease and the carrier
              state in this population and confirms biochemical data showing

              sessions of manual physical therapy, including desensitization
              maneuvers of the central nervous system, or decompression/release
              of the carpal tunnel. Societal costs and health-related quality
              of life (estimated by the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions
              [EQ-5D] scale) over 1 year were used to generate incremental cost
              per quality-adjusted life year ratios for each treatment.
              RESULTS:The analysis was possible for 118 patients (98\%).
              Incremental quality-adjusted life years showed greater
              cost-effectiveness in favor of manual physical therapy
              (difference, 0.135; 95\% confidence interval: 0.134, 0.136).
              Manual therapy was significantly less costly than surgery (mean
              difference in cost per patient, €2576; P<.001). Patients in the
              surgical group received a greater number of other treatments and
              made more visits to medical doctors than those receiving manual
              physical therapy (P = .02). Absenteeism from paid work was
              significantly higher in the surgery group (P<.001). The major
              contributors to societal costs were the treatment protocol
              (surgery versus manual therapy mean difference, €106 980) and
              absenteeism from paid work (surgery versus manual physical
              therapy mean difference, €42 224). CONCLUSION:Manual physical
              therapy, including desensitization maneuvers of the central
              nervous system, has been found to be equally effective but less
              costly (ie, more cost-effective) than surgery for women with CTS.
              From a cost-benefit perspective, the proposed CTS manual physical
              therapy intervention can be considered. LEVEL OF

               components of rehabilitation. Given the increasing use of
               telehealth to meet rehabilitation needs, it is important to
               examine the feasibility of such assessments within the
               constraints of telerehabilitation. OBJECTIVE:The objective of
               this study was to examine the reliability and validity of the
               Tinetti Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment gait scale
               (POMA-G) and cane height assessment under various video and
               transmission settings to demonstrate the feasibility of
               teleassessment. DESIGN:This repeated-measures study compared the
               test performances of in-person, slow motion (SM) review, and
               normal-speed (NS) video ratings at various fixed frame rates (8,
               15, and 30 frames per second) and bandwidth (128, 384, and 768
               kB/s) configurations. METHODS:Overall bias, validity, and
               interrater reliability were assessed for in-person, SM video,
               and NS video ratings, with SM video rating as the gold standard,
               as well as for different frame rate and bandwidth configurations
               within NS videos. RESULTS:There was moderate to good interrater
               reliability for the POMA-G (intraclass correlation coefficient
               [ICC] = 0.66-0.77 across all configurations) and moderate
               validity for in-person ($\beta$ = 0.62; 95\% confidence interval
               [CI] = 0.37-0.87) and NS video ($\beta$ = 0.74; 95\% CI =
               0.67-0.80) ratings compared with the SM video rating. For cane
               height, interrater reliability was good (ICC = 0.66-0.77),
               although it was significantly lower at the lowest frame rate (8
               frames per second) (ICC = 0.66; 95\% CI = 0.54-0.76) and
               bandwidth (128 kB/s) (ICC = 0.69; 95\% CI = 0.57-0.78)
               configurations. Validity for cane height was good for both
               in-person ($\beta$ = 0.80; 95\% CI = 0.62-0.98) and NS video
               ($\beta$ = 0.86; 95\% CI = 0.81-0.90) ratings compared with SM
               video rating. LIMITATIONS:Some lower frame rate and bandwidth
               configurations may limit the reliability of remote cane height
               assessments. CONCLUSIONS:Teleassessment for POMA-G and cane
               height using typically available internet and video quality is
               feasible, valid, and reliable.",

              supraspinatus tendon tears were randomly allocated into one of

              intervention. Of these, 167 shoulders were available for

               acutely in about 7\% of patients who have limb fractures, limb
               surgery, or other injuries. Many cases resolve within the first
               year, with a smaller subset progressing to the chronic form.
               This transition is often paralleled by a change from ``warm
               complex regional pain syndrome,'' with inflammatory
               characteristics dominant, to ``cold complex regional pain
               syndrome'' in which autonomic features dominate. Multiple
               peripheral and central mechanisms seem to be involved, the
               relative contributions of which may differ between individuals
               and over time. Possible contributors include peripheral and
               central sensitization, autonomic changes and sympatho-afferent
               coupling, inflammatory and immune alterations, brain changes,
               and genetic and psychological factors. The syndrome is diagnosed
               purely on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms. Effective
               management of the chronic form of the syndrome is often
               challenging. Few high quality randomized controlled trials are
               available to support the efficacy of the most commonly used

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND:Physical fitness is a marker of health and is
               associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
               Identifying which components of physical fitness are associated
               with HRQoL in people with fibromyalgia may contribute to the
               development of more specific therapeutic strategies.
               OBJECTIVE:The 2 aims of this study were to examine the
               association of different components of physical fitness (ie,
               flexibility, muscle strength, speed and agility, and
               cardiorespiratory fitness) with HRQoL and to determine the
               extent to which any association between the components of
               physical fitness and HRQoL were of clinical relevance to women
               with fibromyalgia. DESIGN:A cross-sectional design was used.
               METHODS:This study included 466 women with fibromyalgia from
               southern Spain (Andalusia). The Senior Fitness Test battery and
               the handgrip test were used to assess physical fitness, and the
               36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) was used to assess
               HRQoL. Tender points, cognitive impairment, anthropometric
               measurements, and medication usage were also measured. First,
               multivariate linear regression was used to assess the individual
               relationship of each physical fitness test with the 8 dimensions
               of the SF-36. Second, a standardized composite score was
               computed for each component of physical fitness (flexibility,
               muscle strength, speed and agility, and cardiorespiratory
               fitness). A 1-way analysis of covariance to assess the
               differences in each of the 8 dimensions of the SF-36 across each
               physical fitness composite score was conducted. Forward stepwise
               regression was performed to analyze which components of physical
               fitness were independently associated with the SF-36 physical
               and mental component scales. RESULTS:Overall, higher levels of
               physical fitness were associated with higher levels of HRQoL
               (regardless of the SF-36 subscale evaluated). The effect sizes
               for HRQoL between participants with the lowest and the highest
               physical fitness levels ranged from moderate to large (Cohen d =
               0.53-0.90). The muscle strength composite score was
               independently associated with the SF-36 physical component
               scale, whereas the flexibility composite score and
               cardiorespiratory fitness were independently associated with the
               SF-36 mental component scale. LIMITATIONS:A limitation was that
               the cross-sectional design precluded the establishment of
               causality. Additionally, only women were included in the study,
               because fibromyalgia predominantly affects women.
               CONCLUSIONS:High levels of physical fitness were consistently
               associated with better HRQoL in women with fibromyalgia;
               clinically relevant differences were demonstrated between those
               at extreme physical fitness levels. Muscle strength,
               flexibility, and cardiorespiratory fitness were independent
               indicators of HRQoL. These results warrant further prospective
               research on the potential of fitness to predict HRQoL in this
               population.",

               hypothesis testing, particularly when data are applied in the
               context of clinical practice. A CI provides a range of
               population values with which a sample statistic is consistent at
               a given level of confidence (usually 95\%). Conventional
               hypothesis testing serves to either reject or retain a null
               hypothesis. A CI, while also functioning as a hypothesis test,
               provides additional information on the variability of an
               observed sample statistic (ie, its precision) and on its
               probable relationship to the value of this statistic in the
               population from which the sample was drawn (ie, its accuracy).
               Thus, the CI focuses attention on the magnitude and the
               probability of a treatment or other effect. It thereby assists
               in determining the clinical usefulness and importance of, as
               well as the statistical significance of, findings. The CI is
               appropriate for both parametric and nonparametric analyses and
               for both individual studies and aggregated data in
               meta-analyses. It is recommended that, when inferential
               statistical analysis is performed, CIs should accompany point
               estimates and conventional hypothesis tests wherever possible.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Patellar taping is widely used clinically to treat
               patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS). Although
               patellar taping has been demonstrated to reduce patellofemoral
               pain in patients with PFPS, the kinematic source for this pain
               reduction has not been identified. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of
               this study was to quantify the changes in the
               6-degrees-of-freedom patellofemoral kinematics due to taping in
               patients with PFPS. DESIGN: A within-subject design and a sample
               of convenience were used. PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen volunteers (19
               knees) who were diagnosed with patellofemoral pain that was
               present for a year or longer were included. Each knee had to
               meet at least 1 of the following inclusion criteria: Q-angle of
               > or =15 degrees, a positive apprehension test, patellar lateral
               hypermobility (> or =10 mm), or a positive ``J sign.'' METHODS:
               Each knee underwent 2 randomly ordered testing conditions
               (untaped and taped). A full fast-phase contrast (PC) magnetic
               resonance image set was acquired for each condition while the
               participants volitionally extended and flexed their knee.
               Three-dimensional displacements and rotations were calculated
               through integration of the fast-PC velocity data. Statistical
               comparisons between baseline patellofemoral kinematics and the
               change in kinematics due to taping were performed using a
               2-tailed paired Student t test. Correlations between baseline
               patellofemoral kinematics and the change in kinematics due to
               taping also were quantified. RESULTS: Patellar taping resulted
               in a significant patellofemoral inferior shift. The strongest
               correlation existed between the change in lateral-medial
               displacement with taping and baseline (r=-.60). CONCLUSIONS: The
               inferior shift in patellar displacement with taping partially
               explains the previously documented decrease in pain due to
               increases in contact area. The lack of alteration in 5 of the 6
               kinematic variables with taping may have been due to the fact
               that post-taping kinematic alterations are sensitive to the
               baseline kinematic values.",

               common form of shoulder pain and a persistent musculoskeletal
               problem. Conservative and invasive treatments, aimed at the
               shoulder joint, have had limited success. Research suggests
               shoulder function is related to thoracic posture, but it is
               unknown whether thoracic posture is associated with SIS.
               OBJECTIVE:The objective of this study was to investigate whether
               there is a relationship between SIS and thoracic posture.
               DESIGN:This was a case control study. METHODS:Thoracic posture
               of 39 participants with SIS and 39 age-, gender-, and dominant
               arm-matched controls was measured using the modified Cobb angle
               from a standing lateral radiograph. Thoracic range of motion
               (ROM) was also measured using an inclinometer. Between-group
               differences were compared using t tests. The relationship
               between thoracic posture and thoracic ROM was determined with
               linear regression. RESULTS:Twenty women and 19 men with SIS
               (mean age = 57.1 years, SD = 11.1) and 39 age-matched,
               gender-matched, and dominant arm-matched controls (mean age =
               55.7years, SD = 10.6) participated. Individuals with SIS had
               greater thoracic kyphosis (mean difference = 6.2o, 95\% CI
               2.0-10.4) and less active thoracic extension (7.8o, 95\% CI =
               2.2-13.4). Greater thoracic kyphosis was associated with less
               extension ROM (ie, more flexion when attempting full extension:
               $\beta$ = 0.71, 95\% CI = 0.45-0.97). LIMITATIONS:These
               cross-sectional data can only demonstrate association and not
               causation. Both radiographic measurements and inclinometer
               measurements were not blinded. CONCLUSION:Individuals with SIS
               had a greater thoracic kyphosis and less extension ROM than age-
               and gender-matched healthy controls. These results suggest that

              infiltrate in the cervical extensor musculature in a cohort of
              chronic whiplash patients (WAD II) and healthy control subjects
              across muscle and cervical segmental level. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND
              DATA:Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be regarded as the gold
              standard for muscle imaging; however, there is little knowledge
              about in vivo features of neck extensor muscles in patients
              suffering from persistent WAD and how fat content alters across
              the factors of muscle, vertebral segments, age, self-reported
              pain and disability, compensation status, body mass index, and
              duration of symptoms. METHODS:A reliable MRI measure for fatty
              infiltrate was performed of the cervical extensor muscles
              bilaterally in 113 female subjects (79 WAD, 34 healthy control;
              18-45 years, 3 months to 3 years post injury). The measure was
              performed on all subjects for the rectus capitis posterior minor
              and major, multifidus, semispinalis cervicis and capitis,
              splenius capitis, and upper trapezius. RESULTS:The WAD subjects
              had significantly larger amounts of fatty infiltrate for all of
              the cervical extensor muscles compared with healthy control
              subjects (all P < 0.0001). In addition, the amount of fatty
              infiltrate varied by both cervical level and muscle, with the
              rectus capitis minor/major and multifidi at C3 having the largest
              amount of fatty infiltrate (P < 0.0001). Intramuscular fat was
              independent of age, self-reported pain/disability, compensation
              status, body mass index, and duration of symptoms.
              CONCLUSION:There is significantly greater fatty infiltration in
              the neck extensor muscles, especially in the deeper muscles in
              the upper cervical spine, in subjects with persistent WAD when
              compared with healthy controls. Future studies are required to
              investigate the relationships between muscular alterations and
              symptoms in patients suffering from persistent WAD.",

              ankle sprains are one of the most frequently occurring sports
              injuries. Cuboid syndrome, which is difficult to diagnose, may
              result from a plantar flexion/ inversion ankle injury and could

              this case series is to describe the examination, evaluation, and
              treatment of the cuboid syndrome following a lateral ankle

              to 2 treatments consisting of the ``cuboid whip'' manipulation.
              No recurrence of symptoms was reported upon immediate return to
              competition or during the remainder of the season (mean
              follow-up, 5.7 months; range, 2 to 8 months). DISCUSSION:Based on
              those 7 patients, our results suggest that patients who are
              properly diagnosed with cuboid syndrome and receive the cuboid
              manipulation can return to competitive activity within 1 or 2
              visits without injury recurrence.",

              flexion-extension radiographs due to suspicion of lumbar
              instability were studied to examine the relationship between the
              clinical presentation and the presence of radiographic
              instability of the lumbar spine. Patients had a mean age of 39.2
              (+/-11.3) years, with a mean Oswestry score of 20.4\% (+/-13.3).
              The median duration of symptoms was 78 days. All patients
              underwent both a radiographic and clinical examination. The
              reliability of the radiographic variables was high, while the
              reliability of clinical variables ranged from moderate to good.
              Twenty-eight patients (57\%) had radiographic instability based
              on published norms. Clinical variables related to the presence of
              radiographic instability were age, lumbar flexion range of
              motion, total extension range of motion, the Beighton scale for
              general ligamentous laxity, and segmental intervertebral motion
              testing. The presence of at least 53 degrees of lumbar flexion or
              a lack of hypomobility with intervertebral motion testing
              resulted in a positive likelihood ratio of 4.3 (95\% CI: 1.8,
              10.6), for predicting radiographic instability. The results of
              this study indicate that various factors from the clinical
              examination are useful for predicting radiographic instability.
              If the findings of this study can be replicated, these clinical
              factors could be used to inform treatment decision-making without
              a sole reliance on radiographic assessment.",

               manipulative therapy is commonly recommended. Previous
               systematic reviews and practice guidelines have reached
               discordant results on the effectiveness of this therapy for low
               back pain. PURPOSE: To resolve the discrepancies related to use
               of spinal manipulative therapy and to update previous estimates
               of effectiveness by comparing spinal manipulative therapy with
               other therapies and then incorporating data from recent
               high-quality randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) into the
               analysis. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane
               Controlled Trials Register, and previous systematic reviews.
               STUDY SELECTION: Randomized, controlled trials of patients with
               low back pain that evaluated spinal manipulative therapy with at
               least 1 day of follow-up and at least one clinically relevant
               outcome measure. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors, who served as the
               reviewers for all stages of the meta-analysis, independently
               extracted data from unmasked articles. Comparison treatments
               were classified into the following seven categories: sham,
               conventional general practitioner care, analgesics, physical
               therapy, exercises, back school, or a collection of therapies
               judged to be ineffective or even harmful (traction, corset, bed
               rest, home care, topical gel, no treatment, diathermy, and
               minimal massage). DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirty-nine RCTs were
               identified. Meta-regression models were developed for acute or
               chronic pain and short-term and long-term pain and function. For
               patients with acute low back pain, spinal manipulative therapy
               was superior only to sham therapy (10-mm difference [95\% CI, 2
               to 17 mm] on a 100-mm visual analogue scale) or therapies judged
               to be ineffective or even harmful. Spinal manipulative therapy
               had no statistically or clinically significant advantage over
               general practitioner care, analgesics, physical therapy,
               exercises, or back school. Results for patients with chronic low
               back pain were similar. Radiation of pain, study quality,
               profession of manipulator, and use of manipulation alone or in
               combination with other therapies did not affect these results.
               CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that spinal manipulative
               therapy is superior to other standard treatments for patients
               with acute or chronic low back pain.",

  abstract  = "PURPOSE:Four-corner arthrodesis with scaphoid excision has been
               shown to be an acceptable method for treating wrist degenerative
               changes. Some recent studies have identified higher complication
               rates when circular plates are used. This study examined a
               consecutive case series with defined technique for outcome and
               complications. METHODS:A retrospective assessment was performed
               in a consecutive cohort of 28 patients who underwent a
               standardized 4-corner arthrodesis with a 2nd-generation circular
               plate and distal radius bone grafting for a diagnosis of
               scapholunate advanced collapse, scaphoid nonunion advanced
               collapse, or midcarpal arthrosis. Complete data were obtained
               for 26 of the patients and partial data for the other 2.
               Follow-up examination included visual analog scale and activity
               scores, work status, posteroanterior and lateral radiographs,
               bone union status, grip strength, range of motion, and
               complications. RESULTS:Average follow-up was 46 months. Range of
               motion averaged 45\% of the uninjured side (average extension,
               35 degrees; average flexion, 26 degrees). Grip strength averaged
               82\% of the uninjured side. The mean visual analog scale pain
               and activity scores were 2.3/10 and 2.4/10. Only 1 patient
               required job modification because of wrist impairment.
               Radiographs demonstrated union of the primary capitolunate
               fusion mass in all of the cases. There was 1 case of probable
               but not certain peritriquetral nonunion and 1 case of
               asymptomatic loss of radiolunate joint space; in terms of
               hardware, there was screw back-out (of 1 screw) in 1 case the
               plate broke in 1 case. Two patients underwent reoperation, one
               for radial styloid impingement pain and the other for lack of
               flexion. CONCLUSIONS:Despite recent reports indicating a high
               nonunion rate with plate fixation, standardized 4-corner
               arthrodesis using a recessed, dorsal circular plate and distal
               radius bone grafting produced excellent and reproducible results
               in this consecutive series. Notably, there was no development of
               secondary arthritic changes at the radiolunate joint, indicating
               a reasonable durability to the procedure. Optimal results
               require exacting technique with quality bone graft.",

              in medicine. It is essential in the formulation of a diagnosis
              and key to the effective and safe management of patients. Yet,
              the overall diagnostic error rate remains unacceptably high. In
              more than four decades of research, a variety of approaches have
              been taken, but a consensus approach toward diagnostic decision
              making has not emerged. In the last 20 years, important gains
              have been made in psychological research on human judgment.
              Dual-process theory has emerged as the predominant approach,
              positing two systems of decision making, System 1 (heuristic,
              intuitive) and System 2 (systematic, analytical). The author
              proposes a schematic model that uses the theory to develop a
              universal approach toward clinical decision making. Properties of
              the model explain many of the observed characteristics of
              physicians' performance. Yet the author cautions that not all
              medical reasoning and decision making falls neatly into one or
              the other of the model's systems, even though they provide a
              basic framework incorporating the recognized diverse approaches.
              He also emphasizes the complexity of decision making in actual
              clinical situations and the urgent need for more research to help
              clinicians gain additional insight and understanding regarding

              has led to more scientifically based rehabilitation programs.
              Several investigators have sought to quantify the biomechanics

  abstract = "BACKGROUND:One of the challenges in conducting research in the
              field of massage and bodywork is the lack of consistent
              terminology for describing the treatments given by massage
              therapists. The objective of this study was to develop a taxonomy
              to describe what massage therapists actually do when giving a
              massage to patients with musculoskeletal pain. METHODS:After
              conducting a review of the massage treatment literature for
              musculoskeletal pain, a list of candidate techniques was
              generated for possible inclusion in the taxonomy. This list was
              modified after discussions with a senior massage therapist
              educator and seven experienced massage therapists participating
              in a study of massage for neck pain. RESULTS:The taxonomy was
              conceptualized as a three level classification system, principal
              goals of treatment, styles, and techniques. Four categories
              described the principal goal of treatment (i.e., relaxation
              massage, clinical massage, movement re-education and energy
              work). Each principal goal of treatment could be met using a
              number of different styles, with each style consisting of a
              number of specific techniques. A total of 36 distinct techniques
              were identified and described, many of which could be included in
              multiple styles. CONCLUSION:A new classification system is
              presented whereby practitioners using different styles of massage
              can describe the techniques they employ using consistent
              terminology. This system could help facilitate standardized
              reporting of massage interventions.",

              compared two well-defined treatment protocols. The objective was
              to compare the outcome of flexion-distraction (FD) procedures
              performed by chiropractors with an active trunk exercise protocol
              (ATEP) performed by physical therapists. A randomized clinical
              trial study design was used. Subjects, 18 years of age and older,
              with a primary complaint of low back pain (>3 months) were
              recruited. A 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) for perceived
              pain, the Roland Morris (RM) Questionnaire for low back function,
              and the SF-36 for overall health status served as primary outcome
              measures. Subjects were randomly allocated to receive either FD
              or ATEP. The FD intervention consisted of the application of
              flexion and traction applied to specific regions in the low back,
              with the aid of a specially designed manipulation table. The ATEP
              intervention included stabilizing and flexibility exercises, the
              use of modalities, and cardiovascular training. A total of 235
              subjects met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and signed the
              informed consent. Of these, 123 were randomly allocated to FD and
              112 to the ATEP. Study patients perceived significantly less pain
              and better function after intervention, regardless of which group
              they were allocated to (P<0.01). Subjects randomly allocated to
              the flexion-distraction group had significantly greater relief
              from pain than those allocated to the exercise program (P=0.01).
              Subgroup analysis indicated that subjects categorized as chronic,
              with moderate to severe symptoms, improved most with the
              flexion-distraction protocol. Subjects categorized with recurrent
              pain and moderate to severe symptoms improved most with the
              exercise program. Patients with radiculopathy did significantly
              better with FD. There were no significant differences between
              groups on the Roland Morris and SF-36 outcome measures. Overall,
              flexion-distraction provided more pain relief than active
              exercise; however, these results varied based on stratification
              of patients with and without radiculopathy and with and without
              recurrent symptoms. The subgroup analysis provides a possible

               to identify how costs and effects have been assessed in economic
               analysis of self-management interventions for CMP and to
               identify the effect of the chosen analytical perspective on
               cost-effectiveness conclusions. Data Sources:Five databases were
               searched for all study designs using relevant terms. Study
               Selection:Two independent researchers reviewed all titles for
               predefined inclusion criteria: adults ($\geq$18 years of age)
               with CMP, interventions with a primary aim of promoting
               self-management, and conducted a cost analysis. Data
               Extraction:Descriptive data including population,
               self-management intervention, analytical perspective, and costs
               and effects measured were collected by one reviewer and checked
               for accuracy by a second reviewer. Data Synthesis:Fifty-seven
               studies were identified: 65\% (n = 37) chose the societal
               perspective, of which 89\% (n = 33) captured health care
               utilization, 92\% (n = 34) reported labor productivity, 65\% (n
               = 24) included intervention delivery, and 59\% (n = 22) captured
               patient/family costs. Types of costs varied in all studies.
               Eight studies conducted analyses from both health service and
               societal perspectives; cost-effectiveness estimates varied with
               perspective chosen, but in no case was the difference sufficient
               to change overall policy recommendations. Limitations:Chronic
               musculoskeletal pain conditions where self-management is
               recommended, but not as a primary treatment, were excluded. Gray
               literature was excluded. Conclusion:Substantial heterogeneity in
               the cost components captured in the assessment of
               self-management for CMP was found; this was independent of the
               analytic perspective used. Greater efforts to ensure complete
               and consistent costings are required if reliable
               cost-effectiveness evidence of self-management interventions is
               to be generated and to inform the most appropriate perspective
               for economic analyses in this field.",

              joint movements during sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit.
              OBJECTIVES:To examine differences in the kinematics and joint
              coordination of the lumbar spine and hips during sit-to-stand and
              stand-to-sit between healthy subjects and patients with subacute
              low back pain (LBP). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:There is a
              paucity of information on the coordination of movements of lumbar
              spine and hips during sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit. The effect
              of LBP, with or without nerve root signs, is largely unknown.
              METHODS:A three-dimensional real-time electromagnetic tracking
              device was used to measure movements of the lumbar spine and hips
              during sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit. Sixty subacute LBP
              participants with or without straight leg raise signs and 20
              healthy asymptomatic participants were recruited. The kinematic
              patterns of lumbar spine and hips were analyzed. Coordination
              between the two joints was studied by relative phase angle
              analysis. RESULTS:The mobility of the spine and hips was
              significantly limited in back pain subjects. It was observed that
              LBP subjects employed various strategies to compensate for the
              limited motions at the hips and lumbar spine. The contribution of
              the lumbar spine relative to that of the hip was found to be
              reduced for subjects with LBP. The lumbar spine-hip joint
              coordination was significantly altered in back pain subjects, in
              particular, those with positive straight leg raise sign.
              CONCLUSION:Back pain was related to changes in the kinematics and
              coordination of the lumbar spine and hips during sit-to-stand and
              stand-to-sit. Assessment of back pain patients should include
              kinematic analysis of the hips as well as the spine.",

              weeks) nonspecific LBP with or without sciatica. Sets of 2
              reviewers independently performed study selection, methodological
              quality assessment, and data extraction. Because available
              studies did not provide sufficient data for statistical pooling,
              we performed a qualitative ``levels of evidence'' analysis,
              systematically estimating the strength of the cumulative evidence
              on the difference/lack of difference observed in trial outcomes.
              RESULTS:A total of 24 RCTs (2177 patients) were included. There
              were 5 trials considered high quality. For mixed groups of
              patients with LBP with and without sciatica, we found: (1) strong
              evidence that there is no statistically significant difference in
              short or long-term outcomes between traction as a single
              treatment, (continuous or intermittent) and placebo, sham, or no
              treatment; (2) moderate evidence that traction as a single
              treatment is no more effective than other treatments; and (3)
              limited evidence that adding traction to a standard physiotherapy
              program does not result in significantly different outcomes. For
              LBP with sciatica, we found conflicting evidence in several of
              the comparisons: autotraction compared to placebo, sham, or no
              treatment; other forms of traction compared to other treatments;
              and different forms of traction. In the remaining comparisons,
              there were no statistically significant differences; level of
              evidence is moderate regarding continuous or intermittent
              traction compared to placebo, sham, or no treatment, and is
              limited regarding different forms of traction. CONCLUSION:Based
              on the current evidence, intermittent or continuous traction as a
              single treatment for LBP cannot be recommended for mixed groups
              of patients with LBP with and without sciatica. Neither can
              traction be recommended for patients with sciatica because of
              inconsistent results and methodological problems in most of the
              studies involved. However, because high-quality studies within
              the field are scarce, because many are underpowered, and because
              traction often is supplied in combination with other treatment
              modalities, the literature allows no firm negative conclusion
              that traction, in a generalized sense, is not an effective
              treatment for patients with LBP.",

               stabilization exercise program: a cross-sectional study.
               OBJECTIVE:To examine the relationship between prognostic factors
               for clinical success with a stabilization exercise program and
               lumbar multifidus (LM) and transversus abdominis (TrA) muscle

               physical therapy clinic. PARTICIPANTS:Volunteers with current
               low back pain (N=40). INTERVENTION:Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME
               MEASURES:We examined the relationship between prognostic factors
               associated with clinical success with a stabilization exercise
               program (positive prone instability test, age 91 degrees ,
               presence of lumbar hypermobility) and degree of TrA and LM
               muscle activation assessed by RUSI. RESULTS:Significant
               univariate relationships were identified between LM muscle
               activation and the number of prognostic factors present (Pearson
               correlation coefficient [r] =-.558, P=.001), as well as the
               individual factors of a positive prone instability test (point
               biserial correlation coefficient [r(pbis)]=.376, P=.018) and
               segmental hypermobility (r(pbis)=.358, P=.025). The multivariate
               analyses indicated that after controlling for other variables,
               the addition of the variable ``number of prognostic factors
               present'' resulted in a significant increase in R(2) (P=.006).
               No significant univariate or multivariate relationships were
               observed between the prognostic factors and TrA muscle
               activation. CONCLUSIONS:Decreased LM muscle activation, but not
               TrA muscle activation, is associated with the presence of
               factors predictive of clinical success with a stabilization
               exercise program. Our findings provide researchers and
               clinicians with evidence regarding the construct validity of the
               prognostic factors examined in this study, as well as the
               potential clinical importance of the LM muscle as a target for
               stabilization exercises.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVES:The study aimed to identify and compare (1) what
               physical therapists perceive to be the main concerns, fears, and
               worries that patients with whiplash-associated disorders (WAD)
               and nontraumatic neck pain (NTNP) have as a result of their
               condition, and (2) the strategies used by physical therapists to
               address these fears and concerns. METHODS:Using convenience
               sampling, 30 physical therapists completed 2 online open-ended
               surveys. The responses were analyzed using 2 descriptive
               analytic methods (thematic analysis and constant comparative
               analysis), and then themes were examined for areas of
               convergence and divergence. RESULTS:Four similar themes for both
               neck pain groups were produced from our analysis of the survey
               responses: (1) interference with daily life, (2) concerns
               related to pain, (3) psychological distress, and (4) ``When I
               will recover?'' Subthemes differed between the groups. For
               example, the theme ``psychological distress'' had subthemes of
               anger and thoughts about no resolution for the WAD group,
               whereas for the NTNP group, subthemes were anxiety and
               uncertainty. The only divergent theme was (5) fear avoidance,
               present in the NTNP group only. Analysis of physical therapist
               strategies identified 3 consistent themes and 5 divergent themes
               across the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS:Physical therapists described a
               wealth of reassurance strategies for individuals with NTNP and
               WAD. There were several shared themes but also some discordant
               ones. Reassurance is multifactorial and needs to be nuanced and
               not prescriptive. IMPACT:These qualitative findings may be key
               to inform the differentiated content of training programs for
               physical therapists delivering reassurance for these 2
               populations.",

  abstract = "CONTEXT:In recent decades, the fastest growth in lumbar surgery
              occurred in older patients with spinal stenosis. Trials indicate
              that for selected patients, decompressive surgery offers an
              advantage over nonoperative treatment, but surgeons often
              recommend more invasive fusion procedures. Comorbidity is common
              in older patients, so benefits and risks must be carefully
              weighed in the choice of surgical procedure. OBJECTIVE:To examine
              trends in use of different types of stenosis operations and the
              association of complications and resource use with surgical
              complexity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS:Retrospective cohort
              analysis of Medicare claims for 2002-2007, focusing on 2007 to
              assess complications and resource use in US hospitals. Operations
              for Medicare recipients undergoing surgery for lumbar stenosis (n
              = 32,152 in the first 11 months of 2007) were grouped into 3
              gradations of invasiveness: decompression alone, simple fusion (1
              or 2 disk levels, single surgical approach), or complex fusion
              (more than 2 disk levels or combined anterior and posterior
              approach). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:Rates of the 3 types of surgery,
              major complications, postoperative mortality, and resource use.
              RESULTS:Overall, surgical rates declined slightly from 2002-2007,
              but the rate of complex fusion procedures increased 15-fold, from
              1.3 to 19.9 per 100,000 beneficiaries. Life-threatening
              complications increased with increasing surgical invasiveness,
              from 2.3\% among patients having decompression alone to 5.6\%
              among those having complex fusions. After adjustment for age,
              comorbidity, previous spine surgery, and other features, the odds
              ratio (OR) of life-threatening complications for complex fusion
              compared with decompression alone was 2.95 (95\% confidence
              interval [CI], 2.50-3.49). A similar pattern was observed for
              rehospitalization within 30 days, which occurred for 7.8\% of
              patients undergoing decompression and 13.0\% having a complex
              fusion (adjusted OR, 1.94; 95\% CI, 1.74-2.17). Adjusted mean
              hospital charges for complex fusion procedures were US $80,888
              compared with US $23,724 for decompression alone.
              CONCLUSIONS:Among Medicare recipients, between 2002 and 2007, the
              frequency of complex fusion procedures for spinal stenosis
              increased while the frequency of decompression surgery and simple
              fusions decreased. In 2007, compared with decompression, simple
              fusion and complex fusion were associated with increased risk of
              major complications, 30-day mortality, and resource use.",

               Prospective, observational study. SETTING: Hospital setting.
               PARTICIPANTS: Sixty patients with chronic low back pain.
               INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual
               analog scale score and receiver operating characteristic (ROC)

               the blocks, of whom 23 were found positive after the multitest
               regimen and 4 were negative. For the nonresponders (n=33), these
               figures were 7 positive and 26 negative. The calculated

  abstract = "There is evidence that neuromuscular training not only decreases
              the potential biomechanical risk factors for ACL injury, but also
              decreases knee and, specifically, ACL injury incidence in female
              athletes. Five of the six interventions in this systematic review
              demonstrated significant effects on overall knee or ACL injury
              rates. It appears that plyometric power, biomechanics and
              technique, strength, balance, and core stability training can
              induce neuromuscular changes and potential injury prevention
              effects in female athletes. However, it is unknown which of these
              components is most effective or whether the effects are
              combinatorial. Future research should assess the relative
              efficacy of these interventions alone and in combination to
              achieve the optimal effect in the most efficient manner possible.
              Selective combination of neuromuscular training components may
              provide additive effects, further reducing the risk of ACL
              injuries in female athletes. Additional research directions
              include the assessment of relative injury risk using mass
              neuromuscular screening, the development of more specific injury
              prevention protocols targeted toward high-risk athletes, and the
              determination of when these interventions should be implemented.
              It may be that prepubertal or early pubertal female athletes may
              have the potential to achieve optimal biomechanical changes and

              of this randomized clinical trial was to examine the
              generalizability of 3 different manual therapy techniques in a
              patient population with low back pain that satisfy a clinical
              prediction rule (CPR). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Recently a CPR
              that identifies patients with LBP who are likely to respond
              rapidly and dramatically to thrust manipulation has been
              developed and validated. The generalizability of the CPR requires
              further investigation. METHODS: A total of 112 patients were
              enrolled in the trial and provided demographic information and
              completed a number of self-report questionnaires including the
              Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODQ) and the Numerical Pain
              Rating Scale (NPRS) at baseline, 1-week, 4-weeks, and 6-months.
              Patients were randomly assigned to receive 1 of the 3 manual
              therapy techniques for 2 consecutive treatment sessions followed
              by exercise regimen for an additional 3 sessions. We examined the
              primary aim using a linear mixed model for repeated measures,
              using the ODQ and NPRS as dependent variables. The hypothesis of
              interest was the group by time interaction, which was further
              explored with pair-wise comparisons of the estimated marginal
              means. RESULTS: There was a significant group x time interaction
              for the ODQ (P < 0.001) and NPRS scores (P = 0.001). Pair-wise
              comparisons revealed no differences between the supine thrust
              manipulation and side-lying thrust manipulation at any follow-up
              period. Significant differences in the ODQ and NPRS existed at
              each follow-up between the thrust manipulation and the nonthrust
              manipulation groups at 1-week and 4-weeks. There was also a
              significant difference in ODQ scores at 6-months in favor of the
              thrust groups. CONCLUSION: The results of the study support the
              generalizability of the CPR to another thrust manipulation
              technique, but not to the nonthrust manipulation technique that
              was used in this study. In general, our results also provided
              support that the CPR can be generalized to different settings
              from which it was derived and validated. However, additional
              research is needed to examine this issue.",

               recommended to improve outcomes and reduce health care costs.
               The multiple disciplines involved in concussion management often
               result in fragmented and disparate care. A fundamental gap
               exists in the effective utilization of rehabilitation services
               for individuals with concussion. PURPOSE:The purpose of this
               project was to (1) characterize changes in health care
               utilization following implementation of a concussion carepath,
               and (2) present an economic evaluation of patient charges
               following carepath implementation. DESIGN:This was a
               retrospective cohort study. METHODS:A review of electronic
               medical and financial records was conducted of individuals (N =
               3937), ages 18 to 45 years, with primary diagnosis of concussion
               who sought care in the outpatient or emergency department
               settings over a 7-year period (2010-2016). Outcomes including
               encounter length, resource utilization, and charges were
               compared for each year to determine changes from pre- to
               post-carepath implementation. RESULTS:Concussion volumes
               increased by 385\% from 2010 to 2015. Utilization of physical
               therapy increased from 9\% to 20\% while time to referral
               decreased from 72 to 23 days post-injury. Utilization of
               emergency medicine and imaging were significantly reduced.
               Efficient resource utilization led to a 20.7\% decrease in
               median charges (estimated ratio of means [CI] 7.72 [0.53, 0.96])
               associated with concussion care. LIMITATIONS:Encounter lengths
               served as a proxy for recovery time. CONCLUSIONS:The
               implementation of the concussion carepath was successful in
               optimizing clinical practice with respect to facilitating
               continuity of care, appropriate resource utilization, and
               effective handoffs to physical therapy. The utilization of
               enabling technology to facilitate the collection of common

              of prime importance for the assessment and management of chronic
              pain, but its classification is challenging clinically since no
              gold standard method of assessment exists. OBJECTIVES:Designing
              the first set of classification criteria for the classification
              of central sensitization pain. METHODS:A body of evidence from
              original research papers was used by 18 pain experts from 7
              different countries to design the first classification criteria
              for central sensitization pain. RESULTS:It is proposed that the
              classification of central sensitization pain entails 2 major
              steps: the exclusion of neuropathic pain and the differential
              classification of nociceptive versus central sensitization pain.
              For the former, the International Association for the Study of
              Pain diagnostic criteria are available for diagnosing or
              excluding neuropathic pain. For the latter, clinicians are
              advised to screen their patients for 3 major classification
              criteria, and use them to complete the classification algorithm
              for each individual patient with chronic pain. The first and
              obligatory criterion entails disproportionate pain, implying that
              the severity of pain and related reported or perceived disability
              are disproportionate to the nature and extent of injury or
              pathology (i.e., tissue damage or structural impairments). The 2
              remaining criteria are 1) the presence of diffuse pain
              distribution, allodynia, and hyperalgesia; and 2)
              hypersensitivity of senses unrelated to the musculoskeletal
              system (defined as a score of at least 40 on the Central
              Sensitization Inventory). LIMITATIONS:Although based on direct
              and indirect research findings, the classification algorithm
              requires experimental testing in future studies.
              CONCLUSION:Clinicians can use the proposed classification
              algorithm for differentiating neuropathic, nociceptive, and

              knee isokinetic strength in young female athletes who
              subsequently went on to develop PFP relative to their uninjured,
              healthy peers. STUDY DESIGN:Descriptive epidemiology study.
              METHODS:Adolescent female athletes (N = 329) were tested for
              isokinetic strength of the knee (flexion and extension) and hip
              (abduction) and screened for the prevalence of PFP before their

              strength may be at an increased risk for the development of PFP.
              Previous studies that have looked at biomechanics indicated that
              those with PFP have greater hip adduction dynamic mechanics.
              CLINICAL RELEVANCE:Combining the study data with previous
              literature, we theorize that greater hip abduction strength may
              be a resultant symptom of increased eccentric loading of the hip
              abductors associated with increased dynamic valgus biomechanics,
              demonstrated to underlie increased PFP incidence. Further
              research is needed to verify the proposed mechanistic link to the
              incidence of PFP.",

  abstract  = "Background:Limited information exists regarding the
               cost-effectiveness of rehabilitation strategies for individuals
               with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Objective:The study objective was
               to compare the cost-effectiveness of 4 different combinations of
               exercise, manual therapy, and booster sessions for individuals
               with knee OA. Design:This economic evaluation involved a
               cost-effectiveness analysis performed alongside a multicenter
               randomized controlled trial. Setting:The study took place in
               Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Salt Lake City, Utah; and San Antonio,
               Texas. Participants:The study participants were 300 individuals
               taking part in a randomized controlled trial investigating
               various physical therapy strategies for knee OA.
               Intervention:Participants were randomized into 4 treatment
               groups: exercise only (EX), exercise plus booster sessions
               (EX+B), exercise plus manual therapy (EX+MT), and exercise plus
               manual therapy and booster sessions (EX+MT+B). Measurements:For
               the 2-year base case scenario, a Markov model was constructed
               using the United States societal perspective and a 3\% discount
               rate for costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
               Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated to compare
               differences in cost per QALY gained among the 4 treatment
               strategies. Results:In the 2-year analysis, booster strategies
               (EX+MT+B and EX+B) dominated no-booster strategies, with both
               lower health care costs and greater effectiveness. EX+MT+B had
               the lowest total health care costs. EX+B cost $\{\$\}$1061 more
               and gained 0.082 more QALYs than EX+MT+B, for an incremental
               cost-effectiveness ratio of $\{\$\}$12,900/QALY gained.
               Limitations:The small number of total knee arthroplasty
               surgeries received by individuals in this study made the
               assessment of whether any particular strategy was more
               successful at delaying or preventing surgery in individuals with
               knee OA difficult. Conclusions:Spacing exercise-based physical
               therapy sessions over 12 months using periodic booster sessions
               was less costly and more effective over 2 years than strategies
               not containing booster sessions for individuals with knee OA.",

  abstract = "STUDY DESIGN:Prospective cohort/predictive validity study.
              OBJECTIVE:To determine the predictive validity of selected
              clinical examination items and to develop a clinical prediction
              rule to determine which patients with neck pain may benefit from
              cervical thrust joint manipulation (TJM) and exercise.
              BACKGROUND:TJM to the cervical spine has been shown to be
              effective in patients presenting with a primary report of neck
              pain. It would be useful for clinicians to have a decision-making
              tool, such as a clinical prediction rule, that could accurately
              identify which subgroup of patients would respond positively to
              cervical TJM. METHODS:Consecutive patients who presented to
              physical therapy with a primary complaint of neck pain completed
              a series of self-report measures, then received a detailed
              standardized history and physical examination. After the clinical
              examination, all patients received a standardized treatment
              regimen consisting of cervical TJM and range-of-motion exercise.
              Depending on response to treatment, patients were treated for 1
              or 2 sessions over approximately 1 week. At the end of their
              participation in the study, patients were classified as having
              experienced a successful outcome based on a score of +5 (``quite
              a bit better'') or higher on the global rating of change scale.
              Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood
              ratios were calculated for all potential predictor variables.
              Univariate techniques and stepwise logistic regression were used
              to determine the most parsimonious set of variables for
              prediction of treatment success. Variables retained in the
              regression model were used to develop a multivariate clinical
              prediction rule. RESULTS:Eighty-two patients were included in
              data analysis, of whom 32 (39\%) achieved a successful outcome. A
              clinical prediction rule with 4 attributes (symptom duration less
              than 38 days, positive expectation that manipulation will help,
              side-to-side difference in cervical rotation range of motion of
              10° or greater, and pain with posteroanterior spring testing of
              the middle cervical spine) was identified. If 3 or more of the 4
              attributes (positive likelihood ratio of 13.5) were present, the
              probability of experiencing a successful outcome improved from
              39\% to 90\%. CONCLUSION:The clinical prediction rule may improve
              decision making by providing the ability to a priori identify
              patients with neck pain who are likely to benefit from cervical
              TJM and range-of-motion exercise. However, this is only the first
              step in the process of developing and testing a clinical
              prediction rule, as future studies are necessary to validate the
              results and should include long-term follow-up and a comparison
              group. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:Prognosis, level 2b.",

              participation over the year following return-to-sport clearance
              (assessed using the Tegner activity scale) were compared between
              those who met and did not meet cutoffs. Results Participants
              included 115 young athletes (88 female). The proportions meeting
              individual cutoffs ranged from 43.5\% to 78.3\%. The proportions
              meeting cutoffs for all hop tests, all strength tests, and all
              combined measures were 53.0\%, 27.8\%, and 13.9\%, respectively.
              A higher proportion of participants who met cutoffs for both
              strength tests maintained the same level of sports participation
              over the year following return-to-sport clearance than those who
              did not (81.3\% versus 60.2\%, P = .02). Conclusion The
              proportions of young athletes after ACL reconstruction recently
              cleared for return to sports who met the combined criterion
              cutoffs were low. Those who met the criterion cutoffs for both
              strength tests maintained the same level of sports participation
              at higher proportions than those who did not. Level of Evidence

  abstract = "BACKGROUND:Patients and physicians value effective communication
              and consider it an essential part of the medical encounter. This
              study examined physician-patient communication patterns, and
              interruptions in communication, during patient visits with family
              practice and internal medicine residents. METHODS:Observational
              data obtained from 60 routine primary care office visits included
              the time that resident physicians and patients spoke and the
              number and types of interruptions. A total of 22 family practice
              and internal medicine residents participated, 9 from family
              practice and 13 from internal medicine. RESULTS:Patients spoke,
              uninterrupted, an average of 12 seconds after the resident
              entered the room. One fourth of the time, residents interrupted
              patients before they finished speaking. Residents averaged
              interrupting patients twice during a visit. The time with
              patients averaged 11 minutes, with the patient speaking for about
              4 minutes. Computer use during the office visit accounted for
              more interruptions than beepers. Verbal interruptions, a knock on
              the door, beeper interruptions, and computer use all interfered
              with communication, and increased frequency of interruptions are
              associated with less favorable patient perceptions of the office
              visit. Female residents interrupted their patients less often
              than did male physicians. All residents interrupted female
              patients more often than male patients. Early and increased
              interruptions were associated with patients' perception that they
              should have talked more. Third-year residents interrupted
              patients less frequently than did first-year residents.
              CONCLUSIONS:Numerous interruptions occurred during office visits.
              Gender was associated with the pattern of interruptions.
              Physicians frequently interrupted patients before the patients
              were finished speaking. Computer use also interrupted
              physician-patient communication.",

  author   = "Nijs, Jo and Kosek, Eva and Van Oosterwijck, Jessica and Meeus,

  abstract = "BACKGROUND:Exercise is an effective treatment for various chronic
              pain disorders, including fibromyalgia, chronic neck pain,
              osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic low back pain.
              Although the clinical benefits of exercise therapy in these
              populations are well established (i.e. evidence based), it is
              currently unclear whether exercise has positive effects on the
              processes involved in chronic pain (e.g. central pain
              modulation). OBJECTIVES:Reviewing the available evidence
              addressing the effects of exercise on central pain modulation in
              patients with chronic pain. METHODS:Narrative review.
              RESULTS:Exercise activates endogenous analgesia in healthy
              individuals. The increased pain threshold following exercise is
              due to the release of endogenous opioids and activation of
              (supra)spinal nociceptive inhibitory mechanisms orchestrated by
              the brain. Exercise triggers the release of beta-endorphins from
              the pituitary (peripherally) and the hypothalamus (centrally),
              which in turn enables analgesic effects by activating
              $\mu$-opioid receptors peripherally and centrally, respectively.
              The hypothalamus, through its projections on the periaqueductal
              grey, has the capacity to activate descending nociceptive
              inhibitory mechanisms. However, several groups have shown
              dysfunctioning of endogenous analgesia in response to exercise in
              patients with chronic pain. Muscle contractions activate
              generalized endogenous analgesia in healthy, pain-free humans and
              patients with either osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, but
              result in increased generalised pain sensitivity in fibromyalgia
              patients. In patients having local muscular pain (e.g. shoulder
              myalgia), exercising non-painful muscles activates generalized
              endogenous analgesia. However, exercising painful muscles does
              not change pain sensitivity either in the exercising muscle or at
              distant locations. LIMITATIONS:The reviewed studies examined
              acute effects of exercise rather than long-term effects of
              exercise therapy. CONCLUSIONS:A dysfunctional response of
              patients with chronic pain and aberrations in central pain
              modulation to exercise has been shown, indicating that exercise
              therapy should be individually tailored with emphasis on
              prevention of symptom flares. The paper discusses the translation
              of these findings to rehabilitation practice together with future
              research avenues.",

              spinal problems were examined and treated by GPs. We have now
              conducted a new survey among the regular GPs in the same county.
              MATERIAL AND METHOD:All regular GPs in Aust-Agder county received
              an invitation to participate in the study. The doctors were asked
              to continuously register over two weeks all patients who visited
              the doctor and gave spinal problems as their main reason, and to
              describe all measures that were implemented after the
              consultation. RESULTS:Of the 87 practising regular GPs, 53\%
              responded. In total, the doctors had received 5,822 patients
              during the period of study, whereof 3\% had reported spinal
              problems. The examination and treatment provided to these
              patients were on the whole unchanged since 2001. Only 41\% of the
              doctors reported to cooperate regularly with a physiotherapist,
              and 11\% with a chiropractor, a reduction from 73\% and 35\%
              respectively in 2001. The doctors reported co-morbidity in 37\%
              of the patients. Patients were referred for diagnostic imaging
              with equal frequency as in 2001, although skeletal x-ray and CT
              had mainly been replaced by MRI. INTERPRETATION:The doctors in
              this sample treat patients with spinal problems in approximately
              the same way as the doctors in the 2001 survey, but cooperate
              less frequently with physiotherapists and chiropractors, and MRI

  abstract = "In the United States there is currently a paucity of available
              real world minor rear crash data with struck vehicle delta-V, or
              speed change, less than or equal to 15 kilometers per hour. These
              data are essential as researchers attempt to define 'whiplash'
              injury risk potential in these minor crashes. This study analyzed
              a new set of 105 U.S. minor rear aligned crashes between
              passenger vehicles. Mean struck vehicle delta-V and acceleration
              were 6.3 km/h (s.d. = 2.1 km/h) and 1.4 g (s.d. = 0.5 g),
              respectively. A total of 113 struck vehicle occupants were
              diagnosed within five weeks post-crash with 761 ICD-9-CM
              complaints and 427 AIS injuries (99.5\% AIS1) attributed to the
              crashes. No striking vehicle occupants reported complaints. The
              main ICD-9-CM diagnoses were 40.6\% cervical, 22.5\%
              lumbar/sacral and 10.2\% thoracic and the main AIS1 diagnoses
              were 29.7\% cervical, 23.2\% lumbar/sacral and 14.3\% thoracic.
              The diagnosis disparity was mainly due to coding for pre-existing
              degenerative diagnosis in ICD-9-CM. Degenerative spine conditions
              were not significant for increased AIS1 injury risk.
              Surprisingly, many non-'whiplash' diagnoses were found. The AIS
              injury diagnosis distribution and frequency in these minor
              delta-V crashes did not correspond with previous minor rear crash
              studies. A prospectively collected and unbiased minor rear crash
              databank in the model of CIREN or NASS is highly desirable to
              verify or refute these results for the U.S. population since the
              current study cohort may have been influenced by litigation.",

               predictors of community walking performance and walking capacity
               in people with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), compared with
               people with low back pain and asymptomatic control subjects.
               DESIGN:Retrospective analysis. SETTING:University spine program.
               PARTICIPANTS:Participants (N=126; 50 LSS, 44 low back pain, 32
               asymptomatic control subjects) aged 55 to 80 years were studied.
               INTERVENTIONS:Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:Seven-day
               community walking distance measured by pedometer (walking
               performance) and a 15-minute walking test (walking capacity).
               All participants had lumbosacral magnetic resonance imaging,
               electrodiagnostic testing, and a history and physical
               examination, including a history of pain and neurologic
               symptoms, a straight leg raise test, and tests for directional
               symptoms, reflexes, strength, and nerve tension signs. The study
               questionnaire included demographic information, a history of
               back/leg pain, and questions about walking, exercise frequency,
               and pain level, as well as the standardized Quebec Back Pain
               Disability Scale. RESULTS:Body mass index (BMI), pain, age, and
               female sex predicted walking performance (r(2)=.41) and walking
               capacity (r(2)=.41). The diagnosis of LSS itself had no clear
               relationship with either walking variable. Compared with the
               asymptomatic group, LSS participants had significantly lower
               values for all walking parameters, with the exception of stride
               length, while there was no significant difference between the
               LSS and low back pain groups. CONCLUSIONS:BMI, pain, female sex,
               and age predict walking performance and capacity in people with
               LSS, those with low back pain, and asymptomatic control
               subjects. While pain was the strongest predictor of walking
               capacity, BMI was the strongest predictor of walking
               performance. Average pain, rather than leg pain, was predictive
               of walking performance and capacity. Obesity and pain are
               modifiable predictors of walking deficits that could be targets
               for future intervention studies aimed at increasing walking
               performance and capacity in both the low back pain and LSS

              of care that allow patients to choose direct access to physical
              therapy have shown promise in terms of cost reduction for neck
              and back pain. However, real-world exploration within the US
              health care system is notably limited. Objectives To compare
              total claims paid and patient outcomes for patients with neck and
              back pain who received physical therapy intervention via direct
              access versus medical referral. Methods Data were accessed for
              patients seeking care for neck or back pain (n = 603) between
              2012 and 2014, who chose to begin care either through traditional
              medical referral or direct access to a physical therapy- led
              spine management program. All patients received a standardized,
              pragmatic physical therapy approach, with patient-reported
              measures of pain and disability assessed before and after
              treatment. Patient demographics and outcomes data were obtained
              from the medical center patient registry and combined with total
              claims paid calculated for the year after the index claim. Linear
              mixed-effects modeling was used to analyze group differences in
              pain and disability, visits/time, and annualized costs. Results
              Patients who chose to enter care via the direct-access physical
              therapy-led spine management program displayed significantly
              lower total costs (mean difference, \$1543; 95\% confidence
              interval: \$51, \$3028; P = .04) than those who chose traditional
              medical referral. Patients in both groups showed clinically
              important improvements in pain and disability, which were similar
              between groups (P>.05). Conclusion The initial patient choice to
              begin care with a physical therapist for back or neck pain
              resulted in lower cost of care over the next year, while
              resulting in similar improvements in patient outcomes at
              discharge from physical therapy. These findings add to the
              emerging literature suggesting that patients' choice to access
              physical therapy through direct access may be associated with
              lower health care expenditures for patients with neck and back
              pain. Level of Evidence Economic and decision analyses, level 4.

              flexion in standing subjects, under different degrees of
              resistance. DESIGN:Descriptive and correlational.
              BACKGROUND:Pelvic rotation contributes to the change in hip
              flexion angle while individuals are supine. Degree of
              contribution in standing has not been described. METHODS:Pelvic
              and femoral motions, relative to vertical, were documented while
              14 subjects performed three trials of standing unilateral hip
              flexion, both with and without a 4.53 kg ankle weight. Pelvic and
              thigh segments were marked with reflective spheres, and motion
              was captured by video analysis. RESULTS:Pelvic rotation
              contributed 18.1\% of the change in hip flexion angle. Pelvic
              rotation occurred throughout the movement. Neither presence of
              external resistance nor direction of movement significantly
              changed this contribution. CONCLUSIONS:A strong relationship
              exists between pelvic rotation and hip flexion in standing
              subjects. RELEVANCE:Hip flexion, while standing, is a common
              element of many functional activities. Knowledge of the pelvic
              contribution increases our understanding of hip and lumbar spine
              motion during standing activities.",

               Scientific research provides an avenue not only to further the
               field of pain research, but also to study and change the
               patterns and processes that drive systemic and individual
               clinical practices. Implementation science is an emerging field
               that can be integrated with more traditional effectiveness
               research to accomplish a combination of aims within the same
               study. This type of concurrent study of effectiveness and
               implementation is known as a hybrid design and can be used to
               improve behavioral or operational practice patterns as well as
               to collect evidence of clinical effectiveness. Recently, the
               National Pain Strategy put forth recommendations to improve the
               care of patients with pain through research and practice. Hybrid
               designs align well with recent efforts that emphasize
               value-based, patient-centered health care evolving and described
               in the National Pain Strategy. The purposes of this perspective
               are to describe implementation science and hybrid studies and to
               put forth opportunities to utilize this research to advance the

  abstract = "Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) is widely used
              for the treatment of pain. TENS produces an opioid-mediated
              antinociception that utilizes the rostroventromedial medulla
              (RVM). Similarly, antinociception evoked from the periaqueductal
              grey (PAG) is opioid-mediated and includes a relay in the RVM.
              Therefore, we investigated whether the ventrolateral or
              dorsolateral PAG mediates antinociception produced by TENS in
              rats. Paw and knee joint mechanical withdrawal thresholds were
              assessed before and after knee joint inflammation (3\%
              kaolin/carrageenan), and after TENS stimulation (active or sham).
              Cobalt chloride (CoCl(2); 5 mM) or vehicle was microinjected into
              the ventrolateral periaqueductal grey (vlPAG) or dorsolateral
              periaqueductal grey (dlPAG) prior to treatment with TENS. Either
              high (100 Hz) or low (4 Hz) frequency TENS was then applied to
              the inflamed knee for 20 min. Active TENS significantly increased
              withdrawal thresholds of the paw and knee joint in the group
              microinjected with vehicle when compared to thresholds prior to
              TENS (P<0.001) or to sham TENS (P<0.001). The increases in
              withdrawal thresholds normally observed after TENS were prevented
              by microinjection of CoCl(2) into the vlPAG, but not the dlPAG
              prior to TENS and were significantly lower than controls treated
              with TENS (P<0.001). In a separate group of animals,
              microinjection of CoCl(2) into the vlPAG temporarily reversed the
              decreased mechanical withdrawal threshold suggesting a role for
              the vlPAG in the facilitation of joint pain. No significant

              running-related injuries (RRIs) and illness symptoms in half
              marathon and marathon runners during the 16-week period before
              the Utrecht Marathon. METHODS:In this prospective cohort study,
              we used the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center questionnaire to
              register RRIs and illness symptoms every 2 weeks during the
              16-week study period. When an injury or illness occurred,
              questions were added regarding its nature. We calculated the
              incidence proportion (the number of new cases divided by the
              number of runners at risk) and the period prevalence (the number
              of existing and new cases within a 2-week period, divided by the
              total number of runners at risk during that period). RESULTS:Of
              the 161 included runners, 9 out of 10 reported an RRI or illness
              symptom at some time during the study period. In any 2-week
              period, 5.6\% to 14.8\% of the runners reported a new RRI, and
              6.3\% to 13.8\% of the runners reported a new illness symptom.
              The prevalence of RRIs ranged from 29.2\% to 43.5\%, and the
              prevalence of illness symptoms ranged from 28.3\% to 71.2\%. The
              most prevalent RRIs were in the lower leg (prevalence range,
              5.4\%-12.3\%) and knee (prevalence range, 2.7\%-9.3\%). The most
              prevalent illness symptoms were rhinorrhea/sneezing (prevalence
              range, 3.9\%-12.7\%) and coughing (prevalence range,
              3.9\%-11.9\%). The incidence and prevalence of illness symptoms
              peaked at the same time as the influenza-like illness epidemic of
              the winter of 2015-2016. CONCLUSION:Nine out of every 10 runners
              reported an RRI or illness symptom in the lead-up to a half or
              full marathon. In any 2-week period, up to 1 in 7 runners

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND:Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) have been touted as
               the ultimate assessment of quality medical care and have been
               proposed as performance measures after appropriate risk
               adjustment. Although spine conditions represent the most common
               orthopedic disorders, the most used PROs for disabilities
               related to the back and neck-the Modified Low Back Pain
               Disability Questionnaire (MDQ) and the Neck Disability Index
               (NDI)-have not been evaluated as performance measures.
               OBJECTIVE:The objective of this study was to benchmark physical
               therapists' performance in the management of spine conditions
               not involving surgery through the use of risk-adjusted MDQ and
               NDI outcomes. DESIGN:This was a retrospective observational
               study. METHODS:Data were accessed for patients seeking physical
               therapy with no history of related surgery for back or neck pain
               (315,274 treatment episodes) between January 2015 and June 2018.
               Patients with complete data, including initial and matched final
               MDQ or NDI, were considered for analysis (182,276 patients; 2799
               physical therapists). Linear models controlling for baseline PRO
               and patient characteristics predicted PRO change for each
               patient. An aggregated performance ratio of actual PRO change to
               predicted PRO change was calculated for each physical therapist,
               and then empirical bootstrapping was used to develop the median
               performance ratio and its confidence intervals. Physical
               therapists who met a 40-patient threshold for either cohort (MDQ
               or NDI) were classified as ``outperforming,'' ``meeting
               expectations,'' or ``underperforming'' relative to predicted
               values using these 95\% confidence intervals.
               RESULTS:Performance ratios indicated that 10\% and 11\% of
               physical therapists outperformed, 79\% and 78\% met
               expectations, and 11\% and 11\% underperformed relative to the
               risk-adjusted predicted change in the MDQ (1240 therapists;
               97,908 patients) and NDI (461 therapists; 26,123 patients),
               respectively. To demonstrate the clinical importance of risk
               adjustment, clinical performance was evaluated in the seemingly
               homogeneous subset of 208 physical therapists within 0.5 SD of
               the median baseline MDQ and the median actual change in the MDQ.
               Following risk adjustment, 2 physical therapists were classified
               in each of the outperforming and underperforming cohorts.
               LIMITATIONS:The secondarily obtained observational data used
               were not collected for research purposes. Additionally, the
               analyses were limited by missing baseline information and
               follow-up PROs. CONCLUSIONS:The risk-adjusted performance ratios
               for the MDQ and NDI resulted in disparate conclusions regarding
               the quality of care compared with the raw, unadjusted change
               scores. According to the baseline and unadjusted change in the
               MDQ, even physical therapists in the most homogeneous sample
               were differentiated following appropriate risk adjustment.
               Clinically important improvements in actual PROs were observed
               in the outperforming but not in the underperforming physical
               therapists. Clinically meaningful differences in the performance
               ratio are unknown and are a limitation to clinical application
               and an opportunity for future research.",

              degeneration in adults 50 years of age and younger with and
              without self-reported low back pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS:We
              performed a meta-analysis of studies reporting the prevalence of
              degenerative lumbar spine MR imaging findings in asymptomatic and
              symptomatic adults 50 years of age or younger. Symptomatic
              individuals had axial low back pain with or without radicular
              symptoms. Two reviewers evaluated each article for the following
              outcomes: disc bulge, disc degeneration, disc extrusion, disc

              meta-analysis was performed by using a random-effects model.
              RESULTS:An initial search yielded 280 unique studies. Fourteen
              (5.0\%) met the inclusion criteria (3097 individuals; 1193,
              38.6\%, asymptomatic; 1904, 61.4\%, symptomatic). Imaging
              findings with a higher prevalence in symptomatic individuals 50

              1.10-14.55; P = .04), disc protrusion (OR, 2.65; 95\% CI,
              1.52-4.62; P < .01), and disc degeneration (OR, 2.24; 95\% CI,
              1.21-4.15, P = .01). Imaging findings not associated with low
              back pain included any Modic change (OR, 1.62; 95\% CI,
              0.48-5.41, P = .43), central canal stenosis (OR, 20.58; 95\% CI,

  abstract = "BACKGROUND:Increasing cadence is often recommended to reduce load
              rate and to lower injury risk. However, habitual cadence was
              recently shown to be unrelated to load rate. Cadence is likely
              influenced by leg length. If so, then cadence may be related to
              load rate when it is normalized to leg length. OBJECTIVES:To
              examine the relationship between cadence and leg length in both
              injured and uninjured runners with a rearfoot strike pattern. We
              hypothesized that increased leg length would be associated with
              lower cadence. We also evaluated the relationship between cadence
              normalized to leg length and the vertical average load rate
              (VALR), expecting that as cadence normalized to leg length
              increased, VALR would decrease. METHODS:In this cross-sectional
              cohort, laboratory-based study, 40 uninjured and 42 injured
              recreational runners with a rearfoot strike pattern were measured
              at self-selected speeds. The relationship of cadence to leg
              length was measured between groups by injury status. A secondary
              analysis evaluated the relationship between cadence normalized to
              leg length and VALR. The data were analyzed using a multiple
              linear regression, with injury status as a covariate. Alpha was
              set to .05. RESULTS:Accounting for injury status, leg length had
              a moderate negative association with cadence (P<.001, r = 0.449,
              standardized $\beta$ = - 0.443). There were no associations of
              VALR with cadence normalized to leg length by injury status or
              across participants. CONCLUSION:Lower cadence was observed in
              recreational runners with longer legs, regardless of injury
              status. However, cadence was not related to load rate when
              normalized to leg length. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther

  author   = "Wilson, Dianne and Williams, Marie and Butler, David",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:People in persistent pain have been
              reported to pay increased attention to specific words or
              descriptors of pain. The amount of attention paid to pain or cues
              for pain (such as pain descriptors), has been shown to be a major
              factor in the modulation of persistent pain. This relationship
              suggests the possibility that language may have a role both in
              understanding and managing the persistent pain experience. The
              aim of this paper is to describe current models of neuromatrices
              for pain and language, consider the role of attention in
              persistent pain states and highlight discrepancies, in previous
              studies based on the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), of the role
              of attention on pain descriptors. The existence of a pain
              neuromatrix originally proposed by Melzack (1990) has been
              supported by emerging technologies. Similar technologies have
              recently allowed identification of multiple areas of involvement
              for the processing of auditory input and the construction of
              language. As with the construction of pain, this neuromatrix for
              speech and language may intersect with neural systems for broader
              cognitive functions such as attention, memory and emotion.
              METHOD:A systematic search was undertaken to identify
              experimental or review studies, which specifically investigated
              the role of attention on pain descriptors (as cues for pain) in
              persistent pain patients. A total of 99 articles were retrieved
              from six databases, with 66 articles meeting the inclusion
              criteria. After duplicated articles were eliminated, the
              remaining 41 articles were reviewed in order to support a link
              between persistent pain, pain descriptors and attention.
              RESULTS:This review revealed a diverse range of specific pain
              descriptors, the majority of which were derived from the MPQ.
              Increased attention to pain descriptors was consistently reported
              to be associated with emotional state as well as being a
              significant factor in maintaining persistent pain. However,
              attempts to investigate the attentional bias of specific pain
              descriptors highlighted discrepancies between the studies. As
              well as the diversity of pain descriptors used in studies, they
              were inconsistently categorized into domains of pain. A lack of
              consistent bias towards certain pain descriptors was observed,
              and may be explained simply by the fact that the words provided
              are not those which subjects themselves would use.
              CONCLUSION:These findings suggest that the multidimensional and
              individual nature of the persistent pain experience may not be
              adequately explained by pain questionnaires such as the MPQ.
              Personalized pain descriptors may communicate the pain experience
              more appropriately, but may also contribute to an increased
              sensitivity of cortical pain processing areas by capturing
              increased attention for that individual. The language used as
              part of communication between therapists and people with
              persistent pain may provide an, as yet, unexplored adjunct
              strategy in management.",

              straight leg raising (SLR) at less than 60 degrees reproducing
              the leg pain; 3) a computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrating a

               messages relate to their recovery. OBJECTIVES:The aim of this
               study was to explore the relationships between perceptions of
               treatment delivery that are related to an evidence-based
               approach and psychological factors, treatment outcome, and
               treatment satisfaction. DESIGN:A cohort study with 3 measurement
               points was conducted. METHODS:Data on 281 participants were
               collected. RESULTS:High catastrophizing and lower mood in the
               participants were correlated to ``not perceiving the
               biopsychosocial message'' measured at 6 weeks after treatment
               start. Participants who did not perceive the biopsychosocial
               message were at higher risk for disability and had lower
               treatment satisfaction 6 months after treatment start even when
               controlling for pretreatment pain intensity. ``Not perceiving
               the biopsychosocial message'' was not a mediator for treatment
               outcome and treatment satisfaction. Physical therapists'
               treatment orientations or attitudes were not related to the
               perception of the message by the patients. LIMITATIONS:There was
               no measure of actual practice behavior. CONCLUSIONS:Maladaptive
               cognitions and negative emotions appear to affect the way
               information provided during treatment is perceived by patients.
               The way information is perceived by patients influences
               treatment outcome and treatment satisfaction. Physical
               therapists are advised to check that patients with higher levels
               of catastrophizing and lower mood are correctly perceiving and
               interpreting a biopsychosocial message.",

               and is difficult to treat. One possible cause is mismatch
               between motor commands and sensory feedback. This two-part study
               in five paraplegic patients investigated whether a visual
               illusion aimed to correct this mismatch reduces pain. In study
               1, patients undertook three conditions: (i) virtual walking:
               with a mirror placed in front of a screen, patients aligned
               their own upper body with a film of a lower body walking.
               Patients imagined walking and 'watched themselves' walk; (ii)
               guided imagery; (iii) watching a film. One patient withdrew from
               virtual walking because of distress. For all patients, the mean
               (95\% CI) decrease in pain (100 mm VAS) was 42 mm (approximately
               65\%) (11-73 mm) for virtual walking, 18 mm (4-31 mm) for guided
               imagery and 4mm (-3 to 11 mm) for watching the film. Mean (95\%
               CI) time to return to pre-task pain was 34.9 min (20.1-49.8 min)
               for virtual walking; 13.9 min (-0.9 to 28.8 min) for the guided
               imagery and 16.3 min (1.5-31.2 min) for the film. To investigate
               its clinical utility, four patients underwent virtual walking
               every weekday for 3 weeks. Mean (95\% CI) decrease in pain was
               53 mm (45-61 mm) at post training and 43 mm (27-58 mm) at
               3-month follow-up. Virtual walking may be a viable treatment for
               pain after spinal cord injury. A clinical trial seems warranted.",

  abstract  = "Pain neuroscience education (PNE) and motivational interviewing
               (MI) have been widely implemented and tested in the field of
               chronic pain management, and both strategies have been shown to
               be effective in the short term (small effect sizes) for the
               management of chronic pain. PNE uses contemporary pain science
               to educate patients about the biopsychosocial nature of the
               chronicity of their pain experience. The goal of PNE is to
               optimize patients' pain beliefs/perceptions to facilitate the
               acquisition of adaptive pain-coping strategies. MI, on the other
               hand, is a patient-centered communication style for eliciting
               and enhancing motivation for behavior change by shifting the
               patient away from a state of indecision or uncertainty.
               Conceptually, PNE and MI appear to be complementary
               interventions, with complementary rather than overlapping
               effects; MI primarily improves cognitive and behavioral
               awareness and, potentially, adherence to treatment principles,
               whereas PNE potentially increases pain knowledge/beliefs,
               awareness, and willingness to explore psychological factors that
               are potentially associated with pain. Therefore, combining PNE
               with MI might lead to improved outcomes with larger and
               longer-lasting effect sizes. The combined use of PNE and MI in
               patients having chronic pain is introduced here, along with a
               description of how clinicians might be able to integrate PNE and
               MI in the treatment of patients experiencing chronic pain.
               Clinical trials are needed to examine whether combining PNE with
               MI is superior to PNE or MI alone for improving pain and quality
               of life in patients having chronic pain.",

              nervous system. Serotonin (5-hydroxtryptamine [5-HT]) is present
              in central and peripheral serotonergic neurons, it is released
              from platelets and mast cells after tissue injury, and it exerts
              algesic and analgesic effects depending on the site of action and
              the receptor subtype. After nerve injury, the 5-HT content in the
              lesioned nerve increases. 5-HT receptors of the 5-HT3 and 5-HT2A
              subtype are present on C-fibers. 5-HT, acting in combination with
              other inflammatory mediators, may ectopically excite and
              sensitize afferent nerve fibers, thus contributing to peripheral
              sensitization and hyperalgesia in inflammation and nerve injury.",

               joint cartilage and physis of long bones, as well as in the
               talus. The medial femoral condyle is the most commonly affected
               site. OD of the weight-bearing, inferocentral portion of medial

  abstract  = "Hip injuries are prevalent, especially within the athletic
               population. Of the hip injuries in this population, some 18-55\%
               are lesions to the labrum of the hip. Clinical diagnosis of hip
               labral lesions is difficult because data on prevalence are
               varied. In addition, data on the prevalence of internal and
               external risk factors are absent as are data on the correlation
               of these risk factors with labral lesions, making it difficult
               to gauge the diagnostic utility. The mechanism of injury is
               often unknown or not specific to labral lesions. Internal risk
               factors may remain hidden to physical therapists because in most
               jurisdictions, ordering imaging tests is not within their scope
               of practice. Anterior inguinal pain seems highly sensitive for
               the diagnosis of patients with labral lesions but can hardly be
               considered specific; data on other pain-related and mechanical
               symptoms clearly have little diagnostic utility, making these
               data collected during the patient history almost irrelevant to
               diagnosis. By way of a comprehensive literature review and
               narrative and systematic analysis of the methodological quality
               of the retrieved diagnostic utility studies, this paper aimed to
               determine a diagnostic physical examination test or test cluster
               based on current best evidence for the diagnosis of hip labral
               lesions. Current best evidence indicates that a negative finding

               test, the flexion-adduction-axial compression test, the
               Fitzgerald test, or a combination of these tests provides the
               clinician with the greatest evidence-based confidence that a hip
               labral lesion is absent. Currently, research has produced no
               tests with sufficient specificity to help confidently rule in a
               diagnosis of hip labral lesion. Suggestions for future research

               physical therapy interventions directed at the thoracic spine in
               patients with neck pain. The purpose of this study was to
               compare the effectiveness of thoracic spine thrust
               mobilization/manipulation with that of nonthrust
               mobilization/manipulation in patients with a primary complaint
               of mechanical neck pain. The authors also sought to compare the
               frequencies, durations, and types of side effects between the
               groups. SUBJECTS: The subjects in this study were 60 patients
               who were 18 to 60 years of age and had a primary complaint of
               neck pain. METHODS: For all subjects, a standardized history and
               a physical examination were obtained. Self-report outcome
               measures included the Neck Disability Index (NDI), a pain
               diagram, the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), and the
               Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire. After the baseline
               evaluation, the subjects were randomly assigned to receive
               either thoracic spine thrust or nonthrust
               mobilization/manipulation. The subjects were reexamined 2 to 4
               days after the initial examination, and they again completed the
               NDI and the NPRS, as well as the Global Rating of Change (GROC)
               Scale. The primary aim was examined with a 2-way
               repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), with
               intervention group (thrust versus nonthrust
               mobilization/manipulation) as the between-subjects variable and
               time (baseline and 48 hours) as the within-subject variable.
               Separate ANOVAs were performed for each dependent variable:
               disability (NDI) and pain (NPRS). For each ANOVA, the hypothesis
               of interest was the 2-way group x time interaction. RESULTS:
               Sixty patients with a mean age of 43.3 years (SD=12.7) (55\%
               female) satisfied the eligibility criteria and agreed to
               participate in the study. Subjects who received thrust
               mobilization/manipulation experienced greater reductions in
               disability, with a between-group difference of 10\% (95\%
               confidence interval [CI]=5.3-14.7), and in pain, with a
               between-group difference of 2.0 (95\% CI=1.4-2.7). Subjects in
               the thrust mobilization/manipulation group exhibited
               significantly higher scores on the GROC Scale at the time of
               follow-up. No differences in the frequencies, durations, and
               types of side effects existed between the groups. DISCUSSION AND
               CONCLUSION: The results suggest that thoracic spine thrust
               mobilization/manipulation results in significantly greater
               short-term reductions in pain and disability than does thoracic
               nonthrust mobilization/manipulation in people with neck pain.",

              clinical settings to quantify the scope of disability and to
              evaluate the effectiveness of treatment programs. Changes in
              health-related quality of life following physical therapy
              treatment for many patients with orthopaedic-related diagnoses is
              not known. The purposes of this study were to describe changes in
              health-related quality of life between the initial assessment and
              the time of discharge from physical therapy for the most common
              orthopaedic diagnoses and to compare the patterns of deficit
              among diagnostic categories. Patient outcomes in this study were
              evaluated from a large database generated by the Focus on
              Therapeutic Outcomes (FOTO) network. Health-related and
              employment outcomes were described for adult patients who were
              classified using ICD-9-CM codes. The most common orthopaedic
              diagnostic categories were sacroiliac sprain, back sprain, low
              back pain (radiating and nonradiating), neck sprain, neck pain
              (radiating and nonradiating), adhesive capsulitis of the
              shoulder, rotator cuff injury, shoulder sprain, knee dislocation,
              knee sprain, and knee derangement. The primary outcome measure
              was a 17-item questionnaire (the MOS-17) derived from the RAND
              36-Item Health Survey (SF-36) and the 12-item Short Form Health
              Survey (SF-12). The comparison of each cohort to population norms
              was made by calculating a standard score on patient data adjusted
              for age and gender. An effect size was calculated to measure the
              change in health or employment status between the initial
              assessment and discharge from physical therapy. For all
              diagnostic categories, health-related quality of life with
              respect to norms and employment status showed a consistent
              pattern of improvement at the time of discharge compared with the
              initial assessment. There were only small changes in physical
              function for neck and shoulder diagnostic categories. Nearly all
              of the diagnostic categories had large reductions in bodily pain.
              The amount of clinical change in the physical components of
              health-related quality of life--especially the physical function
              and role physical domains--differed substantially across specific
              diagnostic categories. The largest improvements in the physical
              function occurred for patients with knee dislocation and knee
              sprain. Patients with knee dislocation also had the largest
              improvement in role limitations due to physical problems. The
              design of this study does not permit conclusions about the
              efficacy of physical therapy. Further study is needed to
              determine if the finding of different levels of health status
              improvement across diagnostic categories was due to the nature of
              the outcome measure, the type of treatments given to each
              patient, or other confounding variables, like depression or

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE:The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic
              review on manipulative therapy for lower extremity conditions and
              expand on a previously published literature review. METHODS:The
              Scientific Commission of the Council on Chiropractic Guidelines
              and Practice Parameters (CCGPP) was charged with developing
              literature syntheses, organized by anatomical region, to evaluate
              and report on the evidence base for chiropractic care. This
              article is the outcome of this charge. As part of the CCGPP
              process, preliminary drafts of these articles were posted on the
              CCGPP Web site www.ccgpp.org (2006-8) to allow for an open
              process and the broadest possible mechanism for stakeholder
              input. The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health
              Literature; PubMed; Manual, Alternative, and Natural Therapy
              Index System; Science Direct; and Index to Chiropractic
              Literature were searched from December 2006 to February 2008.
              Search terms included chiropractic, osteopathic, orthopedic, or
              physical therapy and MeSH terms for each region. Inclusion
              criteria required a diagnosis and manipulative therapy
              (mobilization and manipulation grades I-V) with or without
              adjunctive care. Exclusion criteria were pain referred from
              spinal sites (without diagnosis), referral for surgery, and
              conditions contraindicated for manipulative therapy. Clinical
              trials were assessed using a modified Scottish Intercollegiate
              Guidelines Network ranking system. RESULTS:Of the total 389
              citations captured, 39 were determined to be relevant. There is a
              level of C or limited evidence for manipulative therapy combined
              with multimodal or exercise therapy for hip osteoarthritis. There
              is a level of B or fair evidence for manipulative therapy of the
              knee and/or full kinetic chain, and of the ankle and/or foot,
              combined with multimodal or exercise therapy for knee
              osteoarthritis, patellofemoral pain syndrome, and ankle inversion
              sprain. There is also a level of C or limited evidence for
              manipulative therapy of the ankle and/or foot combined with
              multimodal or exercise therapy for plantar fasciitis,
              metatarsalgia, and hallux limitus/rigidus. There is also a level
              of I or insufficient evidence for manipulative therapy of the
              ankle and/or foot combined with multimodal or exercise therapy
              for hallux abducto valgus. CONCLUSIONS:There are a growing number
              of peer-reviewed studies of manipulative therapy for lower
              extremity disorders.",

  abstract = "When measuring treatment effect in chronic low back pain with
              multi-item outcome instruments, it is necessary, both for
              clinical decision-making and research purposes, to understand the
              clinical importance of the outcome scores. The aims of the
              present study were three-fold. Firstly, it aimed to estimate the
              minimal clinically important difference of three multi-item
              outcome instruments (the Oswestry Disability Index, the General
              Function Score and the Zung Depression Scale) and of the visual
              analogue scale (VAS) of back pain. Secondly, it aimed to estimate
              the error of measurement of these instruments; and its third aim
              was to describe the clinical meaning of score change. The study
              population consisted of 289 patients treated surgically or
              non-surgically in a randomised controlled trial. The minimal
              clinically important difference was estimated with patient global
              assessment as the external criterion. It was compared with the
              standard error of measurement of the instruments. The individual
              items of the instruments were compared for score changes related
              to improvement and deterioration. The standard error of
              measurement of the Oswestry Disability Index, the General
              Function Score and the Zung Depression Scale was 4, 6 and 3
              units, respectively. The 95\% tolerance interval was 10, 16 and 8
              units, respectively. The minimal clinically important difference
              was 10, 12 and 8-9 units, respectively, thus not significantly
              exceeding the tolerance interval. The minimal clinically
              important difference of VAS back pain was 18-19 units, well
              exceeding the 95\% tolerance interval, which was 15 units.
              Improvement after treatment for chronic low back pain tends to
              occur to a greater extent in sleep disturbance, ability to do
              usual things and psychological irritability, but to a lesser
              extent in the ability to sit, stand and lift. We conclude that
              the VAS of back pain is responsive enough to detect the minimal
              clinically important difference, whereas the smallest acceptable
              score changes of the Oswestry Disability Index, the General
              Function Score and the Zung Depression Scale may require an
              increase to exceed the 95\% tolerance interval when used for
              clinical decision making and for power calculation. Despite
              improvement after treatment, the ability to sit, stand and lift,
              remain notable problems.",

              total of 28 patients with the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome
              in 36 hands were randomly assigned to two groups. A custom made
              neutral volar wrist splint was given to group 1 and group 2. The
              patients were instructed to wear the splints all night and during
              the day as much as possible for 4 wk. The patients in group 2
              were also instructed to perform series of nerve and tendon
              gliding exercises in addition to the splint treatment. Patients
              were evaluated with clinical parameters, a functional status
              scale, and a symptom severity scale. RESULTS: At the end of
              treatment, statistically significant improvement was obtained in
              all parameters in both groups. The improvement in group 2 was
              slightly greater, but the difference between the groups was not
              significant, except for the lateral pinch strength value. Patient
              satisfaction was investigated during the follow-up period,
              ranging from 5 to 11 mo, with a mean of 8 mo. A total of 72\% of
              the patients in group 1 and 93\% of the patients in group 2
              reported good or excellent results. The difference between the
              two groups was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION:
              Although the results in group 2 were better than group 1, the
              difference was not statistically significant. Further
              investigations are required to establish the role of nerve and

              searched the Physiotherapy Evidence Database for parallel-design,
              2-arm RCTs reporting positive treatment effects, based on
              null-hypothesis significance testing, and scoring greater than
              6/10 on the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. No
              restrictions were made on pathology, intervention, or outcome
              variables. Sixty-two of 212 RCTs reported positive effects in at
              least 1 outcome variable. We estimated false-positive risk (FPR)
              with an online calculator, based on number of participants, P
              value, and effect size. For each study, FPR was estimated using a
              range of prior probability assumptions: 0.2 (skeptical
              hypothesis), 0.5, and 0.8 (optimistic hypothesis). RESULTS:We
              calculated the FPR associated with 189 statistically significant
              findings (P<.05) reported across 44 trials. The median FPR was
              9\% (25th-75th percentile, 2\%-24\%). Sixty-three percent of
              statistically significant results (119/189) had an FPR greater
              than 5\%, and 18\% (35/189) had an FPR greater than 50\%.
              Changing the prior probability from skeptical to optimistic
              reduced the median FPR from 29\% (25th-75th percentile, 9\%-56\%)
              to 2\% (25th-75th percentile, 0.6\%-7.0\%).
              CONCLUSION:High-quality RCTs using null-hypothesis significance
              testing often overestimated treatment effects. The median FPR was
              9\%: in 1 in 10 trials, the researchers falsely concluded that
              there was a treatment effect. Future RCTs in sports physical
              therapy should be informed by prestudy odds and a minimum FPR
              estimation. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2020;50(2):104-109.

              study. OBJECTIVE: To investigate associations between
              chiropractic visits and vertebrobasilar artery (VBA) stroke and
              to contrast this with primary care physician (PCP) visits and VBA
              stroke. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Chiropractic care is popular
              for neck pain and headache, but may increase the risk for VBA
              dissection and stroke. Neck pain and headache are common symptoms
              of VBA dissection, which commonly precedes VBA stroke. METHODS:
              Cases included eligible incident VBA strokes admitted to Ontario
              hospitals from April 1, 1993 to March 31, 2002. Four controls
              were age and gender matched to each case. Case and control
              exposures to chiropractors and PCPs were determined from health
              billing records in the year before the stroke date. In the
              case-crossover analysis, cases acted as their own controls.
              RESULTS: There were 818 VBA strokes hospitalized in a population
              of more than 100 million person-years. In those aged <45 years,
              cases were about three times more likely to see a chiropractor or
              a PCP before their stroke than controls. Results were similar in
              the case control and case crossover analyses. There was no
              increased association between chiropractic visits and VBA stroke
              in those older than 45 years. Positive associations were found
              between PCP visits and VBA stroke in all age groups. Practitioner
              visits billed for headache and neck complaints were highly
              associated with subsequent VBA stroke. CONCLUSION: VBA stroke is
              a very rare event in the population. The increased risks of VBA
              stroke associated with chiropractic and PCP visits is likely due
              to patients with headache and neck pain from VBA dissection
              seeking care before their stroke. We found no evidence of excess
              risk of VBA stroke associated chiropractic care compared to
              primary care.",

  abstract = "STUDY DESIGN:A two-group experimental design with repeated
              measures on one factor was used. OBJECTIVE:To describe the
              relation between movement of the hip and lumbar spine during
              active hip flexion in healthy young adults and children. SUMMARY
              OF BACKGROUND DATA:Many descriptions of hip movement and
              procedures for clinically assessing the range of hip joint
              flexion do not take into account the substantive range of lumbar
              spine motion that normally accompanies hip flexion. Posterior
              pelvic rotation, representative of lumbar flexion during hip
              flexion, has been incorrectly regarded as a compensatory
              movement. METHODS:Unilateral full range active hip (knee) flexion
              was examined using computer-aided video analysis in 22 healthy
              young adults and 22 healthy children. RESULTS:Except for the
              first 3 degrees to 5 degrees of the upward movement of hip
              flexion, hip and lumbar spine motion was concurrent in both
              phases of the test movement in children and adults. On the
              average, every 3 degrees of hip motion was accompanied by 1
              degrees of lumbar motion. Throughout the upward movement, the
              relative contribution of hip movement decreased while that of the
              lumbar spine increased. During the downward movement, the hip
              returned nearly to its original starting position while the
              lumbar spine remained noticeably flexed. CONCLUSIONS:There is a
              concurrent motion of the lumbar spine-pelvis and hip during
              normal hip flexion that is analogous with the well-known
              scapulohumeral rhythm accompanying elevation of the shoulder.
              Failure to measure or account for the contribution of the lumbar
              spine to hip flexion could overestimate the range of hip flexion
              by as much as 33.3\%.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study is to compare the
              immediate results of manipulation to mobilization in neck pain
              patients. DESIGN: The patients were compared in a randomized
              controlled trial without long-term follow-up. SETTING: The study
              was conducted at an outpatient teaching clinic on primary and
              referred patients. PATIENTS: One hundred consecutive outpatients
              suffering from unilateral neck pain with referral into the
              trapezius muscle were studied. Fifty-two subjects were
              manipulated and 48 subjects were mobilized. The mean (SD) age was
              34.5 (13.0) yr for the manipulated group and 37.7 (12.5) yr for
              the mobilized group. Sixteen subjects had neck pain for less than
              1 wk, 34 subjects had pain for between 1 wk and 6 mo and 50
              subjects had pain for more than 6 mo. Seventy-eight subjects had
              a past history of neck pain. Thirty-one subjects had been
              involved in an injurious motor vehicle accident and 28 subjects
              had other types of minor trauma to the neck. There were no
              significant differences between the two treatment groups with
              respect to history of neck pain or level of disability as
              measured by the Pain Disability Index. INTERVENTION: The patients
              received either a single rotational manipulation (high-velocity,
              low-amplitude thrust) or mobilization in the form of muscle
              energy technique. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prior to and immediately
              after the treatments, cervical spine range of motion was recorded
              in three planes, and pain intensity was rated on the 101-point
              numerical rating scale (NRS-101). Both pre- and post-test
              measurements were conducted in a blinded fashion. RESULTS: The
              results show that both treatments increase range of motion, but
              manipulation has a significantly greater effect on pain
              intensity. Eighty-five percent of the manipulated patients and
              69\% of the mobilized patients reported pain improvement
              immediately after treatment. However, the decrease in pain
              intensity was more than 1.5 times greater in the manipulated
              group (p = .05). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that a
              single manipulation is more effective than mobilization in
              decreasing pain in patients with mechanical neck pain. Both
              treatments increase range of motion in the neck to a similar
              degree. Further studies are required to determine any long-term
              benefits of manipulation for mechanical neck pain.",

              STUDY DESIGN:Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2.
              METHODS:One hundred female athletes (basketball, soccer,
              volleyball players) were tested using laboratory-based measures
              to confirm the validity of identified laboratory-based correlate
              variables to clinic-based measures included in a prediction
              algorithm to determine high KAM status. To analyze selected
              clinic-based surrogate predictors, another cohort of 20 female
              athletes was simultaneously tested with both clinic-based and
              laboratory-based measures. RESULTS:The prediction model (odds
              ratio: 95\% confidence interval), derived from laboratory-based
              surrogates including (1) knee valgus motion (1.59: 1.17-2.16 cm),
              (2) knee flexion range of motion (0.94: 0.89°-1.00°), (3) body
              mass (0.98: 0.94-1.03 kg), (4) tibia length (1.55: 1.20-2.07 cm),
              and (5) quadriceps-to-hamstrings ratio (1.70: 0.48\%-6.0\%),
              predicted high KAM status with 84\% sensitivity and 67\%
              specificity (P < .001). Clinic-based techniques that used a
              calibrated physician's scale, a standard measuring tape, standard
              camcorder, ImageJ software, and an isokinetic dynamometer showed
              high correlation (knee valgus motion, r = .87; knee flexion range
              of motion, r = .95; and tibia length, r = .98) to simultaneous
              laboratory-based measurements. Body mass and
              quadriceps-to-hamstrings ratio were included in both
              methodologies and therefore had r values of 1.0.
              CONCLUSION:Clinically obtainable measures of increased knee
              valgus, knee flexion range of motion, body mass, tibia length,
              and quadriceps-to-hamstrings ratio predict high KAM status in
              female athletes with high sensitivity and specificity. Female
              athletes who demonstrate high KAM landing mechanics are at
              increased risk for anterior cruciate ligament injury and are more
              likely to benefit from neuromuscular training targeted to this
              risk factor. Use of the developed clinic-based assessment tool
              may facilitate high-risk athletes' entry into appropriate
              interventions that will have greater potential to reduce their
              injury risk.",

               transformation over the last few decades, moving to a doctoring
               profession with more autonomy and a broader scope of practice.
               These changes have occurred in parallel with systemic and
               structural changes in health care and higher education, both of
               which have experienced challenges with improving access and
               controlling costs, and have become a centerpiece of legislative
               and political discourse. At the same time, advances in
               technology have introduced new possibilities in education, with
               the emergence of online, blended, and ``flipped'' learning
               models that supplement or replace face-to-face instruction with
               distance learning. Hybrid education is a type of blended
               learning, utilizing both face-to-face and online instructional
               strategies. In a hybrid learning environment, online content may
               be delivered synchronously or asynchronously, replacing
               traditional face-to-face instructional time and reducing ``seat
               time'' for students. Recent attention has been brought to online
               and hybrid/blended learning in physical therapist education in
               the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, as programs have been
               required to abruptly move from face-to-face to remote
               instruction. Hybrid and other forms of blended learning
               strategies have been described at the physical therapist
               education course level. However, there is no literature
               describing hybrid learning implementation at the physical
               therapist education program ``levels,'' and there has been
               limited discussion on best practices for delivering hybrid,
               blended, and online instruction in physical therapist education.
               This perspective provides an overview of hybrid education,
               describes theoretical frameworks that guide implementation of a
               hybrid education curriculum, and discusses future directions for
               hybrid physical therapist education and educational research.",

               injury from motor vehicle collisions may be related to
               eligibility for compensation for pain and suffering. On January
               1, 1995, the tort-compensation system for traffic injuries,
               which included payments for pain and suffering, in Saskatchewan,
               Canada, was changed to a no-fault system, which did not include
               such payments. To determine whether this change was associated
               with a decrease in claims and improved recovery after whiplash
               injury, we studied a population-based cohort of persons who
               filed insurance claims for traffic injuries between July 1,
               1994, and December 31, 1995. RESULTS:Of 9006 potentially
               eligible claimants, 7462 (83 percent) met our criteria for
               whiplash injury. The six-month cumulative incidence of claims
               was 417 per 100,000 persons in the last six months of the tort
               system, as compared with 302 and 296 per 100,000, respectively,
               in the first and second six-month periods of the no-fault
               system. The incidence of claims was higher for women than for
               men in each period; the incidence decreased by 43 percent for
               men and by 15 percent for women between the tort period and the
               two no-fault periods combined. The median time from the date of
               injury to the closure of a claim decreased from 433 days (95
               percent confidence interval, 409 to 457) to 194 days (95 percent
               confidence interval, 182 to 206) and 203 days (95 percent
               confidence interval, 193 to 213), respectively. The intensity of
               neck pain, the level of physical functioning, and the presence
               or absence of depressive symptoms were strongly associated with

              clinical practice. However, evidence on their combined efficacy
              is lacking. OBJECTIVE:To investigate the effectiveness of
              corticosteroid injection, multimodal physiotherapy, or both in
              patients with unilateral lateral epicondylalgia. DESIGN, SETTING,
              AND PATIENTS:A 2 $\times$ 2 factorial, randomized,
              injection-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at a
              single university research center and 16 primary care settings in
              Brisbane, Australia. A total of 165 patients aged 18 years or
              older with unilateral lateral epicondylalgia of longer than 6
              weeks' duration were enrolled between July 2008 and May 2010;
              1-year follow-up was completed in May 2011.
              INTERVENTIONS:Corticosteroid injection (n = 43), placebo
              injection (n = 41), corticosteroid injection plus physiotherapy
              (n = 40), or placebo injection plus physiotherapy (n = 41). MAIN
              OUTCOME MEASURES:The 2 primary outcomes were 1-year global rating
              of change scores for complete recovery or much improvement and
              1-year recurrence (defined as complete recovery or much
              improvement at 4 or 8 weeks, but not later) analyzed on an
              intention-to-treat basis (P < .01). Secondary outcomes included
              complete recovery or much improvement at 4 and 26 weeks.
              RESULTS:Corticosteroid injection resulted in lower complete
              recovery or much improvement at 1 year vs placebo injection (83\%
              vs 96\%, respectively; relative risk [RR], 0.86 [99\% CI,
              0.75-0.99]; P = .01) and greater 1-year recurrence (54\% vs 12\%;
              RR, 0.23 [99\% CI, 0.10-0.51]; P < .001). The physiotherapy and
              no physiotherapy groups did not differ on 1-year ratings of
              complete recovery or much improvement (91\% vs 88\%,
              respectively; RR, 1.04 [99\% CI, 0.90-1.19]; P = .56) or
              recurrence (29\% vs 38\%; RR, 1.31 [99\% CI, 0.73-2.35]; P =
              .25). Similar patterns were found at 26 weeks, with lower
              complete recovery or much improvement after corticosteroid
              injection vs placebo injection (55\% vs 85\%, respectively; RR,
              0.79 [99\% CI, 0.62-0.99]; P < .001) and no difference between
              the physiotherapy and no physiotherapy groups (71\% vs 69\%,
              respectively; RR, 1.22 [99\% CI, 0.97-1.53]; P = .84). At 4
              weeks, there was a significant interaction between corticosteroid
              injection and physiotherapy (P = .01), whereby patients receiving
              the placebo injection plus physiotherapy had greater complete
              recovery or much improvement vs no physiotherapy (39\% vs 10\%,
              respectively; RR, 4.00 [99\% CI, 1.07-15.00]; P = .004). However,
              there was no difference between patients receiving the
              corticosteroid injection plus physiotherapy vs corticosteroid
              alone (68\% vs 71\%, respectively; RR, 0.95 [99\% CI, 0.65-1.38];
              P = .57). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE:Among patients with chronic
              unilateral lateral epicondylalgia, the use of corticosteroid
              injection vs placebo injection resulted in worse clinical
              outcomes after 1 year, and physiotherapy did not result in any
              significant differences. TRIAL REGISTRATION:anzctr.org

  author    = "Fritz, Julie M and George, Steven Z",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:Psychosocial factors are known to affect
               recovery from acute low back pain. The factors with the greatest
               influence and the optimal methods of measurement and
               interpretation have not been established. The purpose of this
               study was to examine baseline psychosocial variables and their
               ability to predict prolonged work restrictions. SUBJECTS:The
               subjects were 78 people with work-related low back pain who were
               participating in a clinical trial (mean age=37.4 years, SD=10.4,
               range=18-58; mean duration of pain=5.5 days, SD=4.6,
               range=0-19). METHODS:A baseline examination including measures
               of impairment, disability, and psychosocial variables was
               performed. All subjects had physical therapy interventions. Work
               status was assessed after 4 weeks. Sensitivity, specificity, and
               likelihood ratios were calculated for the prediction of work
               status by the use of psychosocial variables. Receiver operator
               characteristic curves and logistic regression were used to
               identify the variables that were most predictive of work status.
               RESULTS:Twenty-two subjects (29\%) had persistent work
               restrictions. The work subscale of the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs
               Questionnaire was the strongest predictor of work status
               (negative likelihood ratio of 0.08 for scores less than 30,
               positive likelihood ratio of 3.33 for scores greater than 34).
               DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION:Fear-avoidance beliefs about work was
               the psychosocial factor that could best be used to predict
               return to work in patients with acute work-related low back
               pain. Examination of fear-avoidance beliefs may serve as a
               useful screening tool for identifying patients who are at risk
               for prolonged work restrictions.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE:Patients with neck pain commonly have altered activity
               of the neck muscles. The craniocervical flexion test (CCFT) is
               used to assess the function of the deep neck flexor muscles in
               patients with musculoskeletal neck disorders. Systematic reviews
               summarizing the measurement properties of the CCFT are outdated.
               The objective of this study was to systematically review the
               measurement properties of the CCFT for assessing the deep neck
               flexor muscles. METHODS:The data sources MEDLINE, EMBASE,
               Physiotherapy Evidence Database, Cochrane Central Register of
               Controlled Trials, Scopus, and Science Direct were searched in
               April 2019. Studies of any design that reported at least 1
               measurement property of the CCFT for assessing the deep neck
               flexor muscles were selected. Two reviewers independently
               extracted data and rated the risk of bias of individual studies
               using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health
               Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) risk-of-bias checklist. The
               overall rating for each measurement property was classified as
               ``positive,'' ``indeterminate,'' or ``negative.'' The overall
               rating was accompanied with a level of evidence.
               RESULTS:Fourteen studies were included in the data synthesis.
               The ratings were positive, and the level of evidence was
               moderate for interrater and intrarater reliability and
               convergent validity. There was conflicting rating and level of
               evidence for discriminative validity. Measurement error was
               indeterminate, with an unknown level of evidence. Responsiveness
               was negative, with a limited level of evidence. A limitation of
               this study was that only papers published in English were
               included. CONCLUSIONS:The CCFT is a valid and reliable test that
               can be used in clinical practice as an assessment test. Because
               of the conflicting and low-quality evidence, caution is advised
               when using the CCFT as a discriminative test and as an outcome
               measure. Future better-designed studies are warranted.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND:The clinical diagnosis of cervicogenic dizziness
               (CGD) is challenging because of a lack of sensitive and specific
               diagnostic tests. It is vital for clinicians to know normative
               responses to suggested clinical tests to help them develop the
               method and interpretation of these tests and maximize their
               diagnostic value for CGD. OBJECTIVE:The purpose of the study was
               to determine normative responses to the clinical application of
               the cervical torsion test and the head-neck differentiation
               test, with consideration of different age groups and sex.
               DESIGN:This was an observational study. METHODS:One hundred
               forty-seven people who were healthy and asymptomatic served as
               controls and performed both tests, which involved 3 components:
               cervical torsion, cervical rotation, and en bloc rotation (head
               and trunk rotation together). RESULTS:Thirty-five (23.81\%) of
               the 147 participants reported some symptoms (mild dizziness,
               visual disturbances, unusual eye movements on opening eyes after
               the test, motion sickness, or nausea) on 1 or more of the 3 test
               components in either test. The specificity when using a positive
               response to torsion alone (ie, a negative response to the
               rotation or en bloc component) was high (for the cervical
               torsion test, 98.64\%; for the head-neck differentiation test,
               89.8\%), as participants with likely global sensorimotor
               sensitivity were eliminated. The combined specificity was 100\%,
               as no participants presented with exclusive positive torsion
               results in both tests. Age and sex did not influence the
               results. LIMITATIONS:There were several examiners who were not
               blinded. CONCLUSIONS:Confirmation of the high specificity of
               these clinical tests with the method used in this study to
               conduct and interpret the results will allow future research to
               determine the sensitivity of these clinical measures in a
               population with CGD and specificity in those with dizziness of
               other origins.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE:To assess the efficacy of traction for patients with
               low back pain (LBP) with or without radiating pain, taking into
               account the clinical technique or parameters used. DATA
               SOURCES:A computer-aided search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, AMED, and
               the Cochrane Collaboration was conducted for randomized
               controlled trials (RCTs) in the English language, from 1966 to
               December 2001. STUDY SELECTION:RCTs were included if:
               participants were over the age of 18 years, with LBP with or
               without radiating pain; the intervention group received traction
               as the main or sole treatment; the comparison group received
               sham traction or another conservative treatment; and the study
               used 1 of 4 primary outcome measures. DATA EXTRACTION:The study
               was conducted in 2 strands. Strand 1 assessed methodologic
               quality using a specific criteria list recommended by the
               Cochrane Back Review Group. The strength of the evidence was
               then rated using the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research
               system. Strand 2 applied further inclusion criteria based on
               recommended clinical parameters. One reviewer conducted the
               selection and data extraction. DATA SYNTHESIS:Strand 1: 1 study
               scored 9 points (maximum score, 10 points); the other 12 scored
               between 0 and 3 points, indicating that most were of poor
               quality. Nine studies reported negative findings, but only 1
               study was of a high quality. Three studies reported positive
               findings and 1 study was inconclusive. Strand 2: only 4 trials
               having low methodologic quality were included, 2 of which
               reported negative findings, and 2 positive findings.
               CONCLUSION:The evidence for the use of traction in LBP remains
               inconclusive because of the continued lack of methodologic rigor
               and the limited application of clinical parameters as used in
               clinical practice. Further trials, which give attention to these
               areas, are needed before any firm conclusions and
               recommendations may be made.",

               the physical therapist intervention for women with urinary
               incontinence (UI). However, possible variations in PFMF
               terminology might hamper communication among researchers and
               health care professionals in Women's Health. Objective:The
               objective of this study was to investigate the terminology of
               PFMF regarding clear terms, conceptual definitions, and
               operational definitions. Data Sources:Data sources include
               PUBMED, CINAHL, LILACS, and SCIELO. Study
               Selection:Observational studies investigating any PFMF in women
               with or without UI, published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese
               from 2005 through 2017, were considered. Data Extraction:The
               risk of bias was assessed by a questionnaire on the quality of
               observational studies. Data on terminology were extracted as
               terms, conceptual definitions, and operational definitions of
               PFMF and were synthesized according to key words, key ideas, and
               key operationalization, respectively. Consistencies and
               variations were identified for the most frequently investigated
               PFMF. Data Synthesis:Sixty-four studies were included, and a low
               risk of bias was identified. All studies presented terms and
               operational definitions of PFMF, but only 29.7\% presented
               conceptual definitions of those terms. One hundred ninety-six
               different terms referred to PFMF. According to similarities in
               terminology, 161 PFMF terms could be grouped under 26 terms; the
               other 35 were left ungrouped. Therefore, a total of 61 different
               PFMF terms were identified in the literature. Limitations:A
               limitation in the study was that only observational studies were
               included. Conclusions:A large variation in PFMF terminology was
               identified, precluding data gathering and meta-analysis. The
               lack of use of standardized terminology delays the progress of
               scientific knowledge and evidence-based practice dissemination.
               Efforts toward creating a collaborative, consensual terminology
               based on a sound framework are necessary.",

              prevalence rates of spondylolysis, isthmic, and degenerative
              spondylolisthesis in an unselected adult community-based
              population; and to evaluate the association of spondylolysis,
              isthmic, and degenerative spondylolisthesis with low back pain
              (LBP). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:Spondylolysis and
              spondylolisthesis are prevalent in the general population;
              however, the relationship between these conditions and LBP is
              controversial. METHODS:This study was an ancillary project to the
              Framingham Heart Study. A sample of 3529 participants of the
              Framingham Heart Study aged 40 to 80 years underwent
              multidetector CT imaging to assess aortic calcification. One
              hundred eighty-eight individuals were consecutively enrolled in
              this study to assess radiographic features potentially associated
              with LBP. The occurrence of LBP in the preceding 12 months was
              evaluated using a self-report questionnaire. The presence of
              spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis was characterized by CT
              imaging. We used multiple logistic regression models to examine
              the association between spondylolysis, spondylolisthesis, and
              LBP, while adjusting for gender, age, and BMI. RESULTS:Twenty-one
              study subjects demonstrated spondylolysis on computed tomography
              (CT) imaging. The male-to-female ratio was approximately 3:1.
              Twenty-one percent of subjects with bilateral spondylolytic
              defects demonstrated no measurable spondylolisthesis. The
              male-to-female ratio of degenerative spondylolisthesis was 1:3,
              and the prevalence of degenerative spondylolisthesis increased
              from the fifth through 8 decades of life. Thirty-eight subjects
              (20.4\%) reported significant LBP. No significant association was
              identified between spondylolysis, isthmic spondylolisthesis, or
              degenerative spondylolisthesis, and the occurrence of LBP.
              CONCLUSION:Based on CT imaging of an unselected community-based
              population, the prevalence of lumbar spondylolysis is 11.5\%,
              nearly twice the prevalence of previous plain radiograph-based
              studies. This study did not reveal a significant association
              between the observation of spondylolysis on CT and the occurrence
              of LBP, suggesting that the condition does not seem to represent
              a major cause of LBP in the general population.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE:Chronic pain from rheumatic and musculoskeletal
              conditions is associated with cortical changes and altered
              tactile acuity. Tactile acuity is considered a clinical signature
              of primary somatosensory representation. The two-point
              discrimination (TPD) threshold is increasingly used both
              clinically and in research. Remarkably, the reliability and
              precision of the measure at commonly used sites has not been
              determined. This study aimed to determine the utility, intra- and
              inter-rater reliability, bias and variability of TPD threshold
              assessment at the neck, back, hand and foot using mechanical
              callipers. METHODS:Intra- and inter-rater reliability of TPD was
              assessed at the back, neck, hand and foot of 28 healthy young
              adults by 28 clinicians. Each clinician received training in the
              assessment of TPD using mechanical callipers and following a
              standardized protocol. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs)
              and Bland-Altman plots were used to assess reliability, bias and
              variability. RESULTS:Intra-rater assessments in all four regions
              and inter-rater assessments at the neck and foot were reliable
              (ICC range 0.79-0.86), but large variability was seen in all
              assessments. Inter-rater assessment of the back (ICC = 0.66) and
              hand (ICC = 0.62) was deemed unreliable. Negligible systematic
              bias suggested learning did not affect reliability.
              CONCLUSION:Individual clinicians are able to reliably assess TPD
              threshold at the neck, back, hand and foot using mechanical
              callipers. Measures obtained by different clinicians were only
              reliable for the neck and foot. Large variability was observed in
              all assessments, which suggests clinicians should be cautious

              result in persistent pain, stiffness, and functional impairments.
              There is insufficient evidence for any particular rehabilitation
              approach after ankle fracture. The purpose of this case series
              was to describe an impairment-based manual physical therapy
              approach to treating patients with conservatively managed ankle
              fractures. Case Description Patients with stable ankle fractures
              post immobilization were treated with manual physical therapy and
              exercise targeted at associated impairments in the lower limb.
              The primary outcome measure was the Lower Extremity Functional
              Scale (LEFS). Secondary outcome measures included the Ankle Lunge
              Test (ALT), Numeric Pain Rating Scale, and Global Rating of
              Change. Outcomes measures were collected at baseline (performed
              within 7 days of immobilization removal), and 4 and 12 weeks
              post-baseline. Outcomes Eleven patients (mean age 39.6 years,
              range 18-64; 2 male), post ankle fracture related immobilization
              (mean duration 48 days, range 21-75) were treated for an average
              of 6.6 sessions (range 3-10) over a mean of 46.1 days (range
              13-81). Compared to baseline, statistically significant and
              clinically meaningful improvement were observed in the LEFS
              (P=.001; mean change, 21.9 points; 95\% confidence interval [CI]
              10.4, 33.4) and ALT (P=.001; mean change 7.8 cm; 95\% CI: 3.9,
              11.7) at 4 weeks. These changes persisted at 12 weeks. Discussion
              Statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements
              in self-reported function and ankle range of motion were observed
              at 4 and 12 weeks following treatment based on impairment-based
              manual physical therapy. All patients tolerated treatment well.

              for complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). The diagnostic entity
              of CRPS (published in the International Association for the Study
              of Pain's Taxonomy monograph in 1994; International Association
              for the Study of Pain [IASP]) was intended to be descriptive,
              general, and not imply etiopathology, and had the potential to
              lead to improved clinical communication and greater
              generalizability across research samples. Unfortunately,
              realization of this potential has been limited by the fact that
              these criteria were based solely on consensus and utilization of
              the criteria in the literature has been sporadic at best. As a
              consequence, the full potential benefits of the IASP criteria
              have not been realized. Consensus-derived criteria that are not
              subsequently validated may lead to over- or underdiagnosis, and
              will reduce the ability to provide timely and optimal treatment.
              Results of validation studies to date suggest that the IASP/CRPS
              diagnostic criteria are adequately sensitive; however, both
              internal and external validation research suggests that
              utilization of these criteria causes problems of overdiagnosis

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Posterior-anterior (PA) assessment of
               the lumbar spine correlates with radiographic signs of
               instability and can guide treatment choices, yet studies of the
               validity of lumbar PA assessments have not been conducted in
               vivo. The purposes of this study were to determine the
               intertester reliability of the PA examination in assessing
               intersegmental lumbar spine motion and to evaluate the validity
               of this procedure in vivo with dynamic magnetic resonance
               imaging (MRI). SUBJECTS: Twenty-nine subjects with central
               lumbar pain participated in this study. METHODS: Two physical
               therapists independently identified each subject's most and
               least mobile lumbar segments using the PA procedure. Midsagittal
               lumbar images were obtained simultaneously during one examiner's
               assessment. Lumbar segmental mobility was quantified from
               magnetic resonance images as the change in the intervertebral
               angle between the resting position and the end range of the PA
               force application. For each vertebral level tested, maximal
               sagittal-plane segmental motion was determined. RESULTS: The
               intertester reliability for identifying the least mobile segment
               was good (agreement=82.8\%, kappa=.71, 95\% confidence interval
               [CI]=.48 to .94), but it was poor for identifying the most
               mobile segment (kappa=.29, 95\% CI=-.13 to .71), despite good
               agreement (79.3\%). The level of agreement between the PA
               assessments and intervertebral motion measured by MRI was poor
               (kappa=.04, 95\% CI=-.16 to .24, and kappa=.00, 95\% CI=-.09 to
               .08, for the least and most mobile segments, respectively).
               DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Despite good intertester reliability
               for identifying the least mobile segment, PA assessments of
               lumbar segmental mobility did not agree with sagittal-plane
               motion measured by dynamic MRI. This finding calls into question
               the validity of the PA procedure for assessing intervertebral
               lumbar spine motion.",

              volleyball players. STUDY DESIGN:Prospective controlled study.
              METHODS:There were 116 male and female volleyball teams followed
              prospectively during the 2001-2002 season. Teams were randomized
              by 4 geographical regions to an intervention group (66 teams, 641
              players) and control group (50 teams, 486 players). Intervention
              teams followed a prescribed balance board training program;
              control teams followed their normal training routine. The coaches
              recorded exposure on a weekly basis for each player. Injuries
              were registered by the players within 1 week after onset.
              RESULTS:Significantly fewer ankle sprains in the intervention
              group were found compared to the control group (risk difference =
              0.4/1000 playing hours; 95\% confidence interval, 0.1-0.7). A
              significant reduction in ankle sprain risk was found only for

              increased in the intervention group. History of knee injury may
              be a contraindication for proprioceptive balance board training.

              132 patients visiting their general practitioner after sustained
              knee trauma. Patients with bone bruise underwent a magnetic
              resonance imaging follow-up study that was discontinued when the
              bone bruise could no longer be discerned or after 1 year of
              follow-up. Bone bruise was assessed on magnetic resonance
              imaging, and pain severity was scored on a numeric rating scale
              (0-10) at baseline, and at 3, 6, and 12 months after trauma. The
              presence of bone bruise and pain severity (over time) were
              compared using linear regression analyses for repeated
              measurements. Adjustment was made for possible confounders:
              presence of meniscal tears, cruciate or collateral ligament

              0 to 2400; higher scores indicate more severe symptoms) at 2

              (SF-36) Physical Component Summary score (range, 0 to 100; higher
              scores indicate better quality of life). RESULTS:Of the 92
              patients assigned to surgery, 6 did not undergo surgery. Of the
              86 patients assigned to control treatment, all received only
              physical and medical therapy. After 2 years, the mean (+/-SD)
              WOMAC score for the surgery group was 874+/-624, as compared with
              897+/-583 for the control group (absolute difference

              confidence interval [CI], -208 to 161; P=0.22 after adjustment
              for baseline score and grade of severity). The SF-36 Physical
              Component Summary scores were 37.0+/-11.4 and 37.2+/-10.6,

              pain-free grip (PFG) force in patients with lateral
              epicondylalgia (LE). METHODS:A repeated measures, crossover,
              single-blinded randomized study was done. Ten patients with LE (5
              female) aged from 30 to 49 years (mean, 42; SD, 6 years)
              participated in this study. Subjects attended 2 experimental
              sessions on 2 separate days at least 48 hours apart. At each
              session, participants received either a manipulative intervention
              or MCI assigned in a random fashion. Pressure pain threshold and
              hot and cold pain thresholds (HPT and CPT, respectively) over the
              lateral epicondyle of both elbows was assessed preintervention
              and 5 minutes postintervention by an examiner blinded to the
              treatment allocation of the patients. In addition, PFG on the
              affected arm and maximum grip force on the unaffected side were
              also assessed. A 3-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with time
              (pre-post) and side (ipsilateral, contralateral to the
              intervention) as within-subjects variable and intervention
              (manipulation or MCI) as between-subjects variable was used to
              evaluate changes in PPT, HPT, CPT, or PFG. RESULTS:The ANOVA
              detected a significant effect for time (F = 37.2, P .2),
              intervention (F = 2.8, P > .2), or side (F = 0.9, P > .4) for
              HPT. Again, no significant effects for time (F = 0.8, P > .4),
              side (F = 0.6, P > .4), or intervention (F = 0.8, P > .5) was
              found for CPT. Finally, a significant interaction between
              intervention and time (F = 9.4, P = .004) and between time * side
              * intervention (F = 18.2, P < .001) was found for grip force.
              Post hoc analysis revealed that the cervical manipulation
              produced an increase of PFG on the affected side as compared with
              the MCI (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS:The application of a manipulation
              at the cervical spine produced an immediate bilateral increase in
              PPT in patients with LE. No significant changes for HPT and CPT
              were found. Finally, cervical manipulation increased PFG on the
              affected side, but not the maximum grip force on the unaffected
              arm. Future studies with larger sample sizes are required to
              examine the effects of thrust manipulation on PPT, HPT, CPT, or

               participants did not meet the criteria for any subgroup, 49.6\%
               (95\% CI=43.4\%-55.8\%) of the participants met the criteria for
               only one subgroup, and 25.2\% (95\% CI=19.8\%-30.6\%) of the
               participants met the criteria for more than one subgroup. The
               most common combination of subgroups was manipulation + specific
               exercise (68.4\% of the participants who met the criteria for 2
               subgroups). Reliability of the algorithm decision was moderate
               (kappa=0.52, 95\% CI=0.27-0.77, percentage of agreement=67\%).
               LIMITATIONS: Due to a relatively small patient sample,
               reliability estimates are somewhat imprecise. CONCLUSIONS: These
               findings provide important clinical data to guide future
               research and revisions to the algorithm. The finding that 25\%
               of the participants met the criteria for more than one subgroup
               has important implications for the sequencing of treatments in
               the algorithm. Likewise, the finding that 25\% of the
               participants did not meet the criteria for any subgroup provides
               important information regarding potential revisions to the
               algorithm's bottom table (which guides unclear classifications).
               Reliability of the algorithm is sufficient for clinical use.",

              unclear and comprehensive evidence-based guidelines have not been
              reported. OBJECTIVE:To provide up-to-date evidence-based
              guidelines for the optimal treatment of FMS. DATA SOURCES,
              SELECTION, AND EXTRACTION: A search of all human trials
              (randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of randomized
              controlled trials) of FMS was made using Cochrane Collaboration
              Reviews (1993-2004), MEDLINE (1966-2004), CINAHL (1982-2004),
              EMBASE (1988-2004), PubMed (1966-2004), Healthstar (1975-2000),

              PsychInfo (1887-2004), and Science Citation Indexes (1996-2004).
              The literature review was performed by an interdisciplinary
              panel, composed of 13 experts in various pain management
              disciplines, selected by the American Pain Society (APS), and
              supplemented by selected literature reviews by APS staff members
              and the Utah Drug Information Service. A total of 505 articles
              were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS:There are major limitations to the
              FMS literature, with many treatment trials compromised by short
              duration and lack of masking. There are no medical therapies that
              have been specifically approved by the US Food and Drug
              Administration for management of FMS. Nonetheless, current
              evidence suggests efficacy of low-dose tricyclic antidepressants,
              cardiovascular exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, and
              patient education. A number of other commonly used FMS therapies,
              such as trigger point injections, have not been adequately
              evaluated. CONCLUSIONS:Despite the chronicity and complexity of
              FMS, there are pharmacological and nonpharmacological
              interventions available that have clinical benefit. Based on
              current evidence, a stepwise program emphasizing education,
              certain medications, exercise, cognitive therapy, or all 4 should
              be recommended.",

               patients attending for physiotherapy have not been extensively

               patients with low back ($\pm$ leg) pain. Using a
               cross-sectional, between-subjects design; four hundred and
               sixty-four patients with low back ($\pm$ leg) pain were assessed
               using a standardised assessment protocol. Patients' pain was
               assigned a mechanisms-based classification based on experienced
               clinical judgement. Clinicians then completed a clinical
               criteria checklist specifying the presence or absence of various
               clinical criteria. A binary logistic regression analysis with
               Bayesian model averaging identified a cluster of two symptoms
               and one sign predictive of PNP, including: 'Pain referred in a
               dermatomal or cutaneous distribution', 'History of nerve injury,
               pathology or mechanical compromise' and 'Pain/symptom
               provocation with mechanical/movement tests (e.g. Active/Passive,
               Neurodynamic) that move/load/compress neural tissue'. This
               cluster was found to have high levels of classification accuracy

               69.4-328.1). Pattern recognition of this empirically-derived
               cluster of symptoms and signs may help clinicians identify an
               assumed dominance of PNP mechanisms in patients with low back

              All randomized controlled trials comparing any manual therapy vs.

              were more effective than pharmacological care in reducing

              confidence interval -0.9124 to -0.1992; three trials) of the
              headache immediately after treatment. No differences were found

              moderate effectiveness at short term, but similar effectiveness
              at longer follow-up for reducing headache frequency, intensity
              and duration in tension type headache than pharmacological

              time was similar across participants and tasks (NS). Accuracy was
              not. The patients with bilateral back pain made more mistakes on
              the left/right trunk rotation task than patients with unilateral
              back pain, who in turn made more mistakes on that task than the
              controls (body part $\times$ group interaction; p<0.001). The
              mean (95\% CI) accuracy for left/right trunk rotation judgements
              was 53.4\% (44.5\% to 62.3\%) for the patients with bilateral
              back pain, 67.2\% (60.2\% to 74.1\%) for the patients with
              unilateral back pain and 87\% (75\% to 98\%) for the control
              participants. This pattern was not observed on the
              left/right-hand judgement task, on which all three groups made
              correct judgements about 83\% of the time (NS).
              DISCUSSION:Chronic back pain is associated with disruption of the
              working body schema of the trunk. This might be an important
              contributor to motor control abnormalities seen in this
              population.",

               clinical prediction rule. DESIGN:Multicenter randomized,
               controlled trial. SETTING:Physical therapy clinics. PATIENTS:131
               consecutive patients with low back pain, 18 to 60 years of age,
               who were referred to physical therapy. INTERVENTION:Patients
               were randomly assigned to receive manipulation plus exercise or
               exercise alone by a physical therapist for 4 weeks.
               MEASUREMENTS:Patients were examined according to the clinical
               prediction rule criteria (symptom duration, symptom location,
               fear-avoidance beliefs, lumbar mobility, and hip rotation range
               of motion). Disability and pain at 1 and 4 weeks and 6 months
               were assessed. RESULTS:Outcome from spinal manipulation depends
               on a patient's status on the prediction rule. Treatment effects
               are greatest for the subgroup of patients who were positive on
               the rule (at least 4 of 5 criteria met); health care utilization
               among this subgroup was decreased at 6 months. Compared with
               patients who were negative on the rule and received exercise,
               the odds of a successful outcome among patients who were
               positive on the rule and received manipulation were 60.8 (95\%
               CI, 5.2 to 704.7). The odds were 2.4 (CI, 0.83 to 6.9) among
               patients who were negative on the rule and received manipulation
               and 1.0 (CI, 0.28 to 3.6) among patients who were positive on
               the rule and received exercise. A patient who was positive on
               the rule and received manipulation has a 92\% chance of a
               successful outcome, with an associated number needed to treat
               for benefit at 4 weeks of 1.9 (CI, 1.4 to 3.5). LIMITATIONS:The
               response rate for the 6-month follow-up resulted in inadequate
               power to detect statistically significant differences for some
               comparisons. CONCLUSIONS:The spinal manipulation clinical

              stiffness in patients with low back pain (LBP) receiving spinal
              manipulative therapy (SMT), evaluate associations between
              stiffness characteristics and clinical outcome, and explore a
              multivariate model of SMT mechanisms as related to effects on
              stiffness, lumbar multifidus (LM) recruitment, and status on a
              clinical prediction rule (CPR) for SMT outcomes. SUMMARY OF
              BACKGROUND DATA:Mechanisms underlying the clinical effects of SMT
              are poorly understood. Many explanations have been proposed, but
              few studies have related potential mechanisms to clinical
              outcomes or considered multiple mechanisms concurrently.
              METHODS:Patients with LBP were treated with two SMT sessions over
              1 week. CPR status was assessed at baseline. Clinical outcome was
              based on the Oswestry disability index (ODI). Mechanized
              indentation measures of spinal stiffness and ultrasonic measures
              of LM recruitment were taken before and after each SMT, and after
              1 week. Global and terminal stiffness were calculated.
              Multivariate regression was used to evaluate the relationship
              between stiffness variables and percentage ODI improvement.
              Zero-order correlations among stiffness variables, LM recruitment
              changes, CPR status, and clinical outcome were examined. A path
              analysis was used to evaluate a multivariate model of SMT
              effects. RESULTS:Forty-eight patients (54\% women) had complete
              stiffness data. Significant immediate decreases in global and
              terminal stiffness occurred post-SMT regardless of outcome. ODI
              improvement was related to greater immediate decrease in global
              stiffness (P = 0.025), and less initial terminal stiffness (P =
              0.01). Zero-order correlations and path analysis supported a
              multivariate model suggesting that clinical outcome of SMT is
              mediated by improvements in LM recruitment and immediate decrease
              in global stiffness. Initial terminal stiffness and CPR status
              may relate to outcome though their relationship with LM
              recruitment. CONCLUSION:The underlying mechanisms explaining the
              benefits of SMT appear to be multifactorial. Both spinal
              stiffness characteristics and LM recruitment changes appear to
              play a role.",

  abstract = "Angina pectoris often results from ischemic episodes that excite
              chemosensitive and mechanoreceptive receptors in the heart.
              Ischemic episodes release a collage of chemicals, including
              adenosine and bradykinin, that excites the receptors of the
              sympathetic and vagal afferent pathways. Sympathetic afferent
              fibers from the heart enter the upper thoracic spinal cord and
              synapse on cells of origin of ascending pathways. This review
              focuses on the spinothalamic tract, but other pathways are
              excited as well. Excitation of spinothalamic tract cells in the
              upper thoracic and lower cervical segments, except C7 and C8
              segments, contributes to the anginal pain experienced in the
              chest and arm. Cardiac vagal afferent fibers synapse in the
              nucleus tractus solitarius of the medulla and then descend to
              excite upper cervical spinothalamic tract cells. This innervation
              contributes to the anginal pain experienced in the neck and jaw.
              The spinothalamic tract projects to the medial and lateral
              thalamus and, based on positron emission tomography studies,
              activates several cortical areas, including the anterior
              cingulate gyrus (BA 24 and 25), the lateral basal frontal cortex,

              of pain has been shown to facilitate these objectives. The
              objective of this study was to investigate whether written
              metaphor and story can be used to increase knowledge of the
              biology of pain and reduce pain-related catastrophizing.
              METHODS:In this randomized single-blind partial cross-over
              controlled trial, 79 people with chronic pain received either a
              booklet of metaphors and stories conveying key pain biology
              concepts or a booklet containing advice on how to manage chronic
              pain according to established cognitive-behavioral principles.
              The primary outcome variables, pain biology knowledge and
              catastrophizing, were measured before randomization, at 3 weeks
              and at 3 months, at which time the control group was crossed over
              to receive the metaphors and stories booklet. Pain and disability
              were secondary outcome variables. RESULTS:The Metaphors group
              showed larger changes in both variables (time $\times$ group
              interactions: P < 0.01, effect size Cohen d = 0.7 for

               repeated measures. Time, treatment group, and status on the
               rule, as well as all possible 2-way and 3-way interactions, were
               modeled as fixed effects, with disability (and pain) as the
               dependent variable. Effect sizes were calculated for both pain
               and disability at each follow-up period. RESULTS:There was no
               3-way interaction for either disability or pain. A 2-way (group
               x time) interaction existed for both disability and pain.
               Pair-wise comparisons of disability demonstrated that
               significant differences existed at each follow-up period between
               the manipulation + exercise group and the exercise-only group.
               The patients who received manipulation exhibited lower pain
               scores at the 1-week follow-up period. The effect sizes were
               moderate for disability at each follow-up period and were
               moderate for pain at the 1-week follow-up. LIMITATIONS:Different
               exercise approaches may have resulted in a different outcome.
               CONCLUSIONS:The results of the current study did not support the
               validity of the previously developed CPR. However, the results
               demonstrated that patients with mechanical neck pain who
               received thoracic spine manipulation and exercise exhibited
               significantly greater improvements in disability at both the
               short- and long-term follow-up periods and in pain at the 1-week
               follow-up compared with patients who received exercise only.",

              and determinants of neck pain and its associated disorders in the
              general population. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:The evidence on
              burden and determinants of neck has not previously been
              summarized. METHODS:The Bone and Joint Decade 2000-2010 Task
              Force on Neck Pain and Its Associated Disorders performed a
              systematic search and critical review of literature published
              between 1980 and 2006 to assemble the best evidence on neck pain.
              Studies meeting criteria for scientific validity were included in
              a best evidence synthesis. RESULTS:We identified 469 studies on
              burden and determinants of neck pain, and judged 249 to be
              scientifically admissible; 101 articles related to the burden and
              determinants of neck pain in the general population. Incidence
              ranged from 0.055 per 1000 person years (disc herniation with
              radiculopathy) to 213 per 1000 persons (self-reported neck pain).
              Incidence of neck injuries during competitive sports ranged from
              0.02 to 21 per 1000 exposures. The 12-month prevalence of pain
              typically ranged between 30\% and 50\%; the 12-month prevalence
              of activity-limiting pain was 1.7\% to 11.5\%. Neck pain was more
              prevalent among women and prevalence peaked in middle age. Risk
              factors for neck pain included genetics, poor psychological
              health, and exposure to tobacco. Disc degeneration was not
              identified as a risk factor. The use of sporting gear (helmets,
              face shields) to prevent other types of injury was not associated
              with increased neck injuries in bicycling, hockey, or skiing.
              CONCLUSION:Neck pain is common. Nonmodifiable risk factors for
              neck pain included age, gender, and genetics. Modifiable factors
              included smoking, exposure to tobacco, and psychological health.
              Disc degeneration was not identified as a risk factor. Future
              research should concentrate on longitudinal designs exploring
              preventive strategies and modifiable risk factors for neck pain.",

               could involve a difficult transition period for patients and
               practitioners. The focus of treatment should shift from
               eliminating pain completely to minimizing the impact of pain on
               quality of life. Many patients with chronic pain take opioids
               either because opioids were previously prescribed as a
               first-line treatment for chronic pain, on the basis of old
               standards of care, or because opioids were initially prescribed
               for acute pain. Patients currently taking opioids will need a
               tapering period during which they transition their pain
               management to interdisciplinary care and nonpharmacological
               treatments. To provide useful treatment options, physical
               therapists need to have a good understanding of the

               components of chronic pain management, issues related to opioid
               use, and pain management strategies used by other health care

               tapering process. A framework has been created to help health

  author   = "Leigh, J Paul",
  abstract = "CONTEXT:The allocation of scarce health care resources requires a
              knowledge of disease costs. Whereas many studies of a variety of
              diseases are available, few focus on job-related injuries and
              illnesses. This article provides estimates of the national costs
              of occupational injury and illness among civilians in the United
              States for 2007. METHODS:This study provides estimates of both
              the incidence of fatal and nonfatal injuries and nonfatal
              illnesses and the prevalence of fatal diseases as well as both
              medical and indirect (productivity) costs. To generate the
              estimates, I combined primary and secondary data sources with
              parameters from the literature and model assumptions. My primary
              sources were injury, disease, employment, and inflation data from
              the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Centers for
              Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as well as costs data from
              the National Council on Compensation Insurance and the Healthcare
              Cost and Utilization Project. My secondary sources were the
              National Academy of Social Insurance, literature estimates of
              Attributable Fractions (AF) of diseases with occupational
              components, and national estimates for all health care costs.
              Critical model assumptions were applied to the underreporting of
              injuries, wage-replacement rates, and AFs. Total costs were
              calculated by multiplying the number of cases by the average cost
              per case. A sensitivity analysis tested for the effects of the
              most consequential assumptions. Numerous improvements over
              earlier studies included reliance on BLS data for government
              workers and ten specific cancer sites rather than only one broad
              cancer category. FINDINGS:The number of fatal and nonfatal
              injuries in 2007 was estimated to be more than 5,600 and almost
              8,559,000, respectively, at a cost of $6 billion and $186
              billion. The number of fatal and nonfatal illnesses was estimated
              at more than 53,000 and nearly 427,000, respectively, with cost
              estimates of $46 billion and $12 billion. For injuries and
              diseases combined, medical cost estimates were $67 billion (27\%
              of the total), and indirect costs were almost $183 billion
              (73\%). Injuries comprised 77 percent of the total, and diseases
              accounted for 23 percent. The total estimated costs were
              approximately $250 billion, compared with the inflation-adjusted
              cost of $217 billion for 1992. CONCLUSIONS:The medical and
              indirect costs of occupational injuries and illnesses are
              sizable, at least as large as the cost of cancer. Workers'
              compensation covers less than 25 percent of these costs, so all
              members of society share the burden. The contributions of
              job-related injuries and illnesses to the overall cost of medical
              care and ill health are greater than generally assumed.",

               the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain. Indeed, these
               substances have been called ``gliotransmitters,'' a term that
               illustrates the close interplay between glial cells and neurons
               in the context of neuroinflammation and pain. However, evidence
               in humans is scarce. The aim of the study was to determine a
               comprehensive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory profile of
               patients with neuropathic pain. Our hypothesis was that we would
               thereby find indications of a postulated on-going process of
               central neuroinflammation. Samples of CSF were collected from 2
               cohorts of patients with neuropathic pain (n = 11 and n = 16,
               respectively) and healthy control subjects (n = 11). The samples
               were analyzed with a multiplex proximity extension assay in
               which 92 inflammation-related proteins were measured
               simultaneously (Proseek Multiplex Inflammation I; Olink
               Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden). Univariate testing with control of
               false discovery rate, as well as orthogonal partial least
               squares discriminant analysis, were used for statistical
               analyses. Levels of chemokines CXCL6, CXCL10, CCL8, CCL11, CCL23
               in CSF, as well as protein LAPTGF-beta-1, were significantly
               higher in both neuropathic pain cohorts compared with healthy
               controls, pointing to neuroinflammation in patients. These 6
               proteins were also major results in a recent similar study in
               patients with fibromyalgia. The findings need to be confirmed in
               larger cohorts, and the question of causality remains to be
               settled. Because it has been suggested that prevalent
               comorbidities to chronic pain (eg, depression, anxiety, poor
               sleep, and tiredness) also are associated with
               neuroinflammation, it will be important to determine whether
               neuroinflammation is a common mediator.",

               results for patients with musculoskeletal disorders, but no
               previous randomized controlled trial (RCT) has investigated its
               effectiveness as the sole procedure for adult patients with
               chronic nonspecific neck pain (NP). OBJECTIVE:The purpose of
               this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of applying GPR
               compared with a manual therapy (MT) intervention to patients
               with chronic nonspecific NP. DESIGN:An RCT was conducted.
               PATIENTS:Ninety-four patients with chronic nonspecific NP (72
               women and 22 men; average age=47.5 years, SD=11.3) were randomly
               assigned to receive either a GPR intervention or an MT
               intervention. OUTCOME MEASURES:Pain intensity (visual analog
               scale), disability (Neck Disability Index), cervical range of
               motion, and kinesiophobia (Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia) were
               assessed. METHODS:The experimental group received GPR, and the
               reference group received MT. Both groups received nine
               60-minute-long sessions with one-to-one supervision from
               physical therapists as the care providers. All participants were
               asked to follow ergonomic advice and to perform home exercises.
               Measures were assessed before treatment, following treatment,
               and at a 6-month follow-up. RESULTS:No important baseline
               differences were found between groups. The experimental group
               exhibited a statistically significant reduction in pain
               following treatment and in disability 6 months after the
               intervention compared with the reference group.
               LIMITATIONS:Randomization did not lead to completely homogeneous
               groups. It also was noted that the time spent integrating the
               movements practiced during the session into daily routines at
               the end of each session was requested only of participants in
               the GPR group and may have had an impact on patient adherence
               that contributed to a better outcome. CONCLUSIONS:The results
               suggest that GPR was more effective than MT for reducing pain
               after treatment and for reducing disability at 6-month follow-up
               in patients with chronic nonspecific NP.",

              Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), a condition-specific,
              patient-reported osteoarthritis index, has been derived,
              published, and validated. The minimum important change (MIC) of
              the ShortMAC has not been reported or compared with the
              traditional 24-item WOMAC. Objectives To investigate the MIC of
              the 12-item ShortMAC and the traditional 24-item WOMAC across 3
              levels of patient-perceived global change. Methods The Management
              of OsteoArthritis Trial cohort of 206 consecutive patients with
              knee or hip osteoarthritis was assessed at the initial visit and
              after 9 weeks of physical therapy (n = 155) or usual medical care
              (n = 51). The global rating of change instrument, assessed at the
              9-week visit, provided the anchor. The MIC was calculated using
              receiver operating characteristic curve methodology for the
              ShortMAC and the traditional WOMAC, across 3 levels of
              patient-perceived change (small, medium, and large change)
              defined by the global rating of change. Results The MICs for the
              ShortMAC and traditional WOMAC (both transformed to a scale from
              0 to 100) were 7.9 and 9.8 points for small change, 8.4 and 9.8
              points for medium change, and 12.1 and 10.1 points for large
              change, respectively. The MICs of the pain and function subscales
              are also reported for small, medium, and large changes.
              Conclusion The lower point estimates for the MIC of the ShortMAC
              compared with that of the traditional WOMAC, using conventional
              definitions of MIC and half the number of items, indicate greater
              efficiency for use in clinical trials and reduced patient burden.

              T{\"o}lle, Thomas R",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVE:Nociceptive and neuropathic components both contribute
              to pain. Since these components require different pain management
              strategies, correct pain diagnosis before and during treatment is
              highly desirable. As low back pain (LBP) patients constitute an
              important subgroup of chronic pain patients, we addressed the
              following issues: (i) to establish a simple, validated screening
              tool to detect neuropathic pain (NeP) components in chronic LBP
              patients, (ii) to determine the prevalence of neuropathic pain
              components in LBP in a large-scale survey, and (iii) to determine
              whether LBP patients with an NeP component suffer from worse, or
              different, co-morbidities. METHODS:In co-operation with the
              German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain we developed and
              validated the painDETECT questionnaire (PD-Q) in a prospective,
              multicentre study and subsequently applied it to approximately
              8000 LBP patients. RESULTS:The PD-Q is a reliable screening tool
              with high sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive
              accuracy; these were 84\% in a palm-top computerised version and
              85\%, 80\% and 83\%, respectively, in a corresponding
              pencil-and-paper questionnaire. In an unselected cohort of
              chronic LBP patients, 37\% were found to have predominantly
              neuropathic pain. Patients with NeP showed higher ratings of pain
              intensity, with more (and more severe) co-morbidities such as
              depression, panic/anxiety and sleep disorders. This also affected
              functionality and use of health-care resources. On the basis of
              given prevalence of LBP in the general population, we calculated
              that 14.5\% of all female and 11.4\% of all male Germans suffer
              from LBP with a predominant neuropathic pain component.
              CONCLUSION:Simple, patient-based, easy-to-use screening
              questionnaires can determine the prevalence of neuropathic pain
              components both in individual LBP patients and in heterogeneous
              cohorts of such patients. Since NeP correlates with more intense
              pain, more severe co-morbidity and poorer quality of life,
              accurate diagnosis is a milestone in choosing appropriate
              therapy.",

  author   = "Buchbinder, Rachelle and Jolley, Damien",
  abstract = "STUDY DESIGN:Quasi-experimental, nonrandomized, nonequivalent,
              parallel group-controlled study involving before and after
              telephone surveys of the general population. OBJECTIVE:To measure
              the magnitude of any sustained change in population beliefs about
              back pain 3 years after cessation of a population-based
              intervention designed to alter beliefs about back pain. SUMMARY
              OF BACKGROUND DATA:A media campaign, which ran between September
              1997 and December 1999 in Victoria, Australia, provided simple
              evidence-based advice about back pain. Following the campaign,
              there were significant improvements in both community and
              physicians' beliefs about back pain, as well as a decline in
              number of workers' compensation back claims. METHODS:The
              campaign's impact on population beliefs about back pain and
              fear-avoidance beliefs was measured using telephone surveys.
              Demographically identical population groups in Victoria and the
              adjacent control state, New South Wales, were surveyed at 4
              times: before, during, immediately after, and 3 years after the
              media campaign in Victoria (surveys 1-4, respectively). Back
              beliefs were measured using the Back Beliefs Questionnaire (BBQ)
              (possible score 9-45, for which a higher score indicates a more
              positive belief about low back trouble). Fear-avoidance beliefs
              were measured using the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire
              consisting of 2 subscales for physical activity and work activity
              (possible scores 0-24 and 0-36, respectively), for which a lower
              score indicates fewer fear-avoidance beliefs. RESULTS:A total of
              6230 individuals in the general population completed the surveys.
              Large statistically significant improvements in population
              beliefs about back pain were still observed in Victoria 3 years
              after cessation of the campaign (mean scores on the BBQ were
              26.5, 28.4, 29.7, and 28.8 for surveys 1-4, respectively). No
              changes were observed in New South Wales (mean scores on the BBQ
              were 26.3, 26.2, 26.3, and 26.1 for surveys 1-4, respectively).
              Of those individuals who reported back pain during the previous
              year, fear-avoidance beliefs about physical activity in Victoria
              were also significantly better than at baseline (mean scores on
              the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire for physical activity
              were 14.0, 12.5, 11.6, and 12.3 for surveys 1-4, respectively).
              CONCLUSIONS:Significant sustained improvements in population
              beliefs about back pain were observed 3 years after cessation of
              a media campaign of provision of positive messages about back
              pain. This result provides further evidence that a primary
              preventive strategy of altering population beliefs about back
              pain may be a highly effective way for reducing back-related
              disability.",

              using magnetic resonance imaging and clinical parameters in
              patients presenting with acute leg pain and low back pain caused
              by lumbar disc herniation (LDH). METHODS:A total of 60 patients
              were enrolled in this study and randomly assigned into 1 of 3
              groups equally according to the therapies applied, either with
              traction, ultrasound, or LPL. Treatment consisted of 15 sessions
              over a period of 3 weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging examinations
              were done before and immediately after the treatment. Physical
              examination of the lumbar spine, severity of pain, functional
              disability by Roland Disability Questionnaire, and Modified
              Oswestry Disability Questionnaire were assessed at baseline,
              immediately after, and at 1 and 3 months after treatment.
              RESULTS:There were significant reductions in pain and disability
              scores between baseline and follow-up periods, but there was not
              a significant difference between the 3 treatment groups at any of
              the 4 interview times. There were significant reductions of size
              of the herniated mass on magnetic resonance imaging after
              treatment, but no differences between groups. CONCLUSIONS:This
              study showed that traction, ultrasound, and LPL therapies were
              all effective in the treatment of this group of patients with
              acute LDH. These results suggest that conservative measures such
              as traction, laser, and ultrasound treatments might have an
              important role in the treatment of acute LDH.",

               entering the workforce, coupled with the growth in projected
               need, raises concerns about where and how entry-level physical
               therapists will practice and if these choices will be affected
               by their debt burden. OBJECTIVE:The purpose of this study was to
               identify the debt profile of entry-level physical therapists and
               explore relationships between student debt and clinical practice
               setting choices. METHODS:This study utilized a cross-sectional
               survey design to identify debt profiles and explore
               relationships between student debt and the clinical practice
               choices of entry-level physical therapists. RESULTS:The mean
               debt-to-income ratio based on the total reported educational
               debt was 197\% (93\%). The most frequently reported debt range
               for doctor of physical therapy (DPT) debt and total educational
               debt was $100,000 to $124,999. Despite the setting itself being
               rated as the most important factor (83\%), 28\% of participants
               reported debt as a barrier to their desired practice setting. In
               addition, when considering job choice overall, 57\% of the
               participants reported that their student debt has had an effect
               on their decision. LIMITATIONS:This study is limited by its
               small sample size, originating from 1 state, and being taken by
               convenience from a special interest group. Data were collected
               via an anonymous survey, which increases the risk of selection
               bias. In addition, there are further personal, family, and
               institutional characteristics that were not collected in this
               study, which may influence the interaction between student debt
               and clinical practice choices. CONCLUSION:The results of this
               study suggest that practice setting choice may be affected by
               physical therapist student debt, and student debt may be a
               barrier overall to practice and career choices in physical
               therapy.",

               ultrasound therapy in the treatment of musculoskeletal
               disorders. METHODS:Published reports of randomized clinical
               trials investigating the effects of ultrasound therapy on pain,
               disability or range of motion were identified by a systematic
               search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane databases,

               all selected publications was assessed systematically by two
               independent and 'blinded' reviewers, using ten validity
               criteria. Data from the original publications were used to
               calculate the differences between groups for success rate, pain,
               disability and range of motion. Statistical pooling was
               performed if studies were homogeneous with respect to study
               populations, interventions, outcome measures and timing of

               of other disorders (n = 7). In 11 out of 13 placebo-controlled
               trials with validity scores of at least five out of ten points,
               no evidence of clinically important or statistically significant
               results was found. Statistical pooling was only feasible for
               placebo-controlled trials on lateral epicondylitis, and produced
               a pooled estimate for the difference in success rate of 15\%
               (95\% confidence interval -8\%-38\%). CONCLUSIONS:As yet, there
               seems to be little evidence to support the use of ultrasound
               therapy in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. The large
               majority of 13 randomized placebo-controlled trials with
               adequate methods did not support the existence of clinically
               important or statistically significant differences in favour of
               ultrasound therapy. Nevertheless, our findings for lateral
               epicondylitis may warrant further investigation.",

              postural orientation during functional tasks may be a valuable
              tool to track rehabilitation progress following anterior cruciate
              ligament (ACL) injury. A valid test battery assessing postural
              orientation as a separate construct is lacking. Objectives To
              evaluate measurement properties of a test battery to assess
              postural orientation in patients with ACL injury. Methods The
              content validity of functional tasks was assessed by expert focus
              group discussions. Fifty-one patients (45\% women) with ACL
              injury performed 9 functional tasks of varying difficulty.
              Interpretability, internal consistency, interrater reliability,
              and measurement error were assessed for segment-specific postural
              orientation errors (POEs), within-task POEs, and total POE score.
              Postural orientation errors were scored on video on an ordinal
              scale from 0 (no POEs) to 3 (major POEs). Results Stair ascent,
              deep squat, and crossover hop for distance were excluded in focus
              group discussions. Postural orientation errors in some tasks were
              excluded due to floor effects. The mini-squat and drop jump were
              excluded due to poor internal consistency ($\alpha$$\leq$.184).
              Interrater reliability values for segment-specific POEs and
              within-task POEs yielded fair to almost perfect agreement
              ($\kappa$ = 0.429-0.875) and almost perfect agreement for total
              POE score (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.842), without
              systematic differences between raters. The smallest detectable
              changes were 0.7 and 5 points for groups and individuals,
              respectively. Conclusion The final test battery (single-leg
              mini-squat, stair descent, forward lunge, single-leg hop for
              distance) of 4 POEs (foot pronation, medial knee-to-foot

               PARTICIPANTS:87 patients with symptoms of knee osteoarthritis as
               defined by the American College of Rheumatology. MAIN OUTCOME
               MEASURES:Primary outcome measure was pain as measured by visual
               analogue scale and participant perceived rating of change.
               Secondary measures of pain and disability included the Western
               Ontario and MacMaster Universities osteoarthritis index, knee
               pain scale, and the SF-36. RESULTS:The therapeutic tape group

               predict occurrence and poor outcome of shoulder symptoms. It can
               be treated with manipulative therapy, but scientific evidence
               for the effectiveness of such therapy is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To
               study the effectiveness of manipulative therapy for the shoulder
               girdle in addition to usual medical care for relief of shoulder
               pain and dysfunction. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial.
               SETTING: General practices in Groningen, the Netherlands.
               PATIENTS: 150 patients with shoulder symptoms and dysfunction of
               the shoulder girdle. INTERVENTIONS: All patients received usual
               medical care from their general practitioners. Only the
               intervention group received additional manipulative therapy, up
               to 6 treatment sessions in a 12-week period. MEASUREMENTS:
               Patient-perceived recovery, severity of the main complaint,
               shoulder pain, shoulder disability, and general health. Data
               were collected during and at the end of the treatment period (at
               6 and 12 weeks) and during the follow-up period (at 26 and 52
               weeks). RESULTS: During treatment (6 weeks), no significant
               differences were found between study groups. After completion of
               treatment (12 weeks), 43\% of the intervention group and 21\% of
               the control group reported full recovery. After 52 weeks,
               approximately the same difference in recovery rate (17
               percentage points) was seen between groups. During the
               intervention and follow-up periods, a consistent between-group
               difference in severity of the main complaint, shoulder pain and
               disability, and general health favored additional manipulative
               therapy. LIMITATIONS: The sample size was small, and assessment
               of end points was subjective. CONCLUSION: Manipulative therapy

               altered lumbar movement pattern of early lumbar motion compared
               to people with healthy backs. Modifying this movement pattern
               during a clinical test decreases pain. It is unknown whether
               similar effects would be seen during a functional activity.
               Objective:The objective of this study was to examine the lumbar
               movement patterns before and after motor skill training, effects
               on pain, and characteristics that influenced the ability to
               modify movement patterns. Design:The design consisted of a
               repeated-measures study examining early-phase lumbar excursion
               in people with LBP during a functional activity test.
               Methods:Twenty-six people with chronic LBP received motor skill
               training, and 16 people with healthy backs were recruited as a
               reference standard. Twenty minutes of motor skill training to
               decrease early-phase lumbar excursion during the performance of
               a functional activity were used as a treatment intervention.
               Early-phase lumbar excursion was measured before and after
               training. Participants verbally reported increased pain,
               decreased pain, or no change in pain during performance of the
               functional activity test movement in relation to their baseline
               pain. The characteristics of people with LBP that influenced the
               ability to decrease early-phase lumbar excursion were examined.
               Results:People with LBP displayed greater early-phase lumbar
               excursion before training than people with healthy backs (LBP:
               mean = 11.2°, 95\% CI = 9.3°-13.1°; healthy backs: mean = 7.1°,
               95\% CI = 5.8°-8.4°). Following training, the LBP group showed a
               decrease in the amount of early-phase lumbar excursion (mean
               change = 4.1°, 95\% CI = 2.4°-5.8°); 91\% of people with LBP
               reported that their pain decreased from baseline following
               training. The longer the duration of LBP ($\beta$ = - 0.22) and
               the more early-phase lumbar excursion before training ($\beta$ =
               - 0.82), the greater the change in early-phase lumbar excursion
               following training. Limitations:The long-term implications of
               modifying the movement pattern and whether the decrease in pain
               attained was clinically significant are unknown.
               Conclusions:People with LBP were able to modify their lumbar
               movement pattern and decrease their pain with the movement

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION:Studies have shown that lumbar surgery (LS) outcomes
              may be influenced by perception. However, the perceptions of the
              general population regarding LS are not known. Therefore, the
              purpose of this study was to investigate the general population's
              perceptions regarding LS. SUBJECTS:This study included 262
              participants (mean age: 46.1 years; 125 males and 137 females)
              from the Las Vegas (NV) metropolitan area. METHODS:A
              questionnaire was developed by an expert panel and was assessed
              for face and content validity. After revision and establishment
              of test-retest reliability, participants were surveyed at 12
              randomly selected grocery stores in Las Vegas. The questionnaire
              assessed demographics, personal and family medical history, and
              11 items pertaining to perceptions of LS. RESULTS:The
              participants had a somewhat uncertain expectation about the
              potential success of LS; however, approximately two-thirds
              believed that LS is unsuccessful to the point that they would not
              be able to return to their previous level of activity after LS.
              Of the questions dealing with success of LS, the neutral response
              had the greatest frequency suggesting a lack of knowledge or
              uncertainty about LS. More than half of the respondents were
              fearful of LS and anticipated a protracted recovery accompanied
              by undesired side effects. Three quarters of the respondents
              agreed that they would try all other means of treatment before
              opting for LS, yet 39\% said that they would undergo LS if they
              had severe lower back pain (LBP). CONCLUSIONS:The general
              population has an uncertain view of LS outcomes and anticipates
              postoperative side effects and a protracted recovery; these views
              may explain why a majority of participants expressed fear of LS
              and why most would only opt for LS as a last resort. This
              uncertainty and anticipation of poor outcomes may be a strong
              contributor to preoperative fear and anxiety, which could
              deleteriously influence postoperative outcomes.",

              Although the true natural history remains unclear, anterior
              cruciate ligament injuries are functionally disabling; they
              predispose the knee to subsequent injuries and the early onset of
              osteoarthritis. This article, the first in a 2-part series, was
              initiated with the use of the PubMed database and a comprehensive
              search of articles that appeared between January 1994 to the
              present, using the keywords anterior cruciate ligament. A total
              of 3810 citations were identified and reviewed to determine the
              current state of knowledge about the treatment of these injuries.
              Articles pertaining to the biomechanical behavior of the anterior
              cruciate ligament, the prevalence of anterior cruciate ligament
              injury, the natural history of the anterior cruciate
              ligament-deficient knee, injuries associated with anterior
              cruciate ligament disruption, risk factors for anterior cruciate
              ligament injury, indications for treatment of anterior cruciate
              ligament injuries, and nonoperative and operative treatments were
              obtained, reviewed, and served as the basis for part I. Part II,
              to be presented in another issue of this journal, includes
              technical aspects of anterior cruciate ligament surgery, bone
              tunnel widening, graft healing, rehabilitation after
              reconstruction, and the effect of sex, age, and activity level on
              the outcome of surgery. Our approach was to build on prior
              reviews and to provide an overview of the literature for each of
              the before-mentioned areas of study by summarizing the highest
              level of scientific evidence available. For the areas that
              required a descriptive approach to research, we focused on the
              prospective studies that were available; for the areas that
              required an experimental approach, we focused on the prospective,
              randomized controlled trials and, when necessary, the highest
              level of evidence available. We were surprised to learn that
              considerable advances have been made during the past decade

  abstract = "The occurrence of proximal humerus fractures will continue to
              rise with the increasing elderly population. Many patients with
              proximal humerus fractures have osteoporosis and have poor
              neuromuscular control mechanisms. This predisposes them to future
              falls and additional fractures. Patients continue to have
              shoulder problems as a result of the fracture for many years
              after the injury. Rehabilitation is central to addressing the
              problems caused by the fracture. The review of the literature on
              proximal humerus rehabilitation suggests that treatment must
              begin immediately if the harmful effects of immobilization are to
              be avoided. Electrotherapy or hydrotherapy does not enhance
              recovery and joint mobilization has limited evidence of its
              efficacy. In the United Kingdom most patients are immobilized
              routinely for 3 weeks or longer and are referred for physical
              therapy. The best available evidence for shoulder rehabilitation
              emphasizes using advice, exercise, and mobilization of limited
              joints to restore upper limb function. Placing controlled
              stresses throughout the fracture site at an early stage will
              optimize bone repair without increasing complication rates. This
              approach requires cooperation between the referring surgeon and
              therapist and will optimize the patient's shoulder function and
              maintain their functional independence. Level of Evidence:

               description of psychologically informed practice (PIP) for low
               back pain. PIP requires a broader focus than traditional
               biomechanical and pathology-based approaches that have been
               traditionally used to manage musculoskeletal pain. A major focus
               of PIP is addressing the behavioral aspects of pain (ie,
               peoples' responses to pain) by identifying individual
               expectations, beliefs, and feelings as prognostic factors for
               clinical and occupational outcomes indicating progression to
               chronicity. Since 2011, the interest in PIP seems to be growing,
               as evidenced by its use in large trials, inclusion in scientific
               conferences, increasing evidence base, and expansion to other
               musculoskeletal pain conditions. Primary care physicians and
               physical therapists have delivered PIP as part of a stratified
               care approach involving screening and targeting of treatment for
               people at high risk for continued pain-associated disability.
               Furthermore, PIP is consistent with recent national priorities
               emphasizing nonpharmacological pain management options. In this
               perspective, PIP techniques that range in complexity are

              with acute low back pain classified into subgroups based on
              examination data and treated with a specific treatment approach.
              OBJECTIVE:To calculated the interrater reliability of a
              classification system, and to compare initial patient
              characteristics and outcomes of physical therapy treatment when a
              classification approach is used. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND
              DATA:Classification of patients with low back pain into
              homogeneous subgroups has been identified as a research priority.
              Identifying relevant subgroups of patients could improve clinical
              outcomes and research efficiency. METHODS:Consecutive patients
              referred to physical therapy for treatment of acute low back pain
              were evaluated and classified into one of four subgroups
              (immobilization, mobilization, specific exercise, or traction)
              before treatment. Physical therapy treatment was based on the
              patient's classification. The classifications were compared for
              initial patient characteristics, frequency and duration of
              physical therapy, and improvement in Oswestry scores. RESULTS:In
              this study, 120 patients were evaluated and classified. Analysis
              of interrater reliability showed a kappa value of 0.56.
              Differences were found among the classifications for age, initial
              Oswestry score, history of low back pain, symptom distribution,
              and average change in Oswestry score with treatment.
              CONCLUSIONS:Reaching a consensus regarding relevant patient
              subgroups requires data on the reliability and validity of
              existing classification systems. Further work is required to
              validate improvement in treatment outcomes using a classification

  abstract = "STUDY DESIGN:Case report. OBJECTIVE:To describe an alternative
              treatment approach for patellofemoral pain. BACKGROUND:Weakness
              of the hip, pelvis, and trunk musculature has been hypothesized
              to influence lower-limb alignment and contribute to
              patellofemoral pain. Two patients who had a chief complaint of
              patellofemoral pain and demonstrated lack of control of the hip
              in the frontal and transverse planes during functional movements
              were treated with an exercise program targeting the hip, pelvis,
              and trunk musculature. METHODS AND MEASURES:The patients
              presented in these 2 case reports did not exhibit obvious
              patellar malalignment or tracking problems; however, on
              qualitative assessment, both demonstrated excessive hip
              adduction, internal rotation, and knee valgus during gait and
              while performing a step-down maneuver. In addition, both patients
              exhibited weakness of the hip abductors, extensors, and external
              rotators, as demonstrated by hand-held dynamometry testing.
              Treatment in both cases occurred over a 14-week period and
              focused on recruitment and endurance training of the hip, pelvis,
              and trunk musculature. Functional status, pain, muscle force
              production, as well as subjective and objective assessment of
              lower-extremity kinematics during gait and a step-down maneuver
              were assessed preintervention and postintervention. RESULTS:Both
              patients experienced a significant reduction in patellofemoral
              pain, improved lower-extremity kinematics during dynamic testing,
              and were able to return to their original levels of function.
              Gluteus medius force production improved by 50\% in patient A and
              90\% in patient B, while gluteus maximus force production
              improved 55\% in patient A and 110\% in patient B. Objective
              kinematic improvements in the step-down task also were
              demonstrated in patient A. CONCLUSION:Assessment and treatment of
              the hip, pelvis, and trunk musculature should be considered in
              the rehabilitation of patients who present with patellofemoral
              pain and demonstrate abnormal lower-extremity kinematics.",

              individuals and although inadequate muscle extensibility remains
              a commonly accepted factor, little is known about the most
              effective method to improve flexibility. Purpose. To determine if
              an isolated neurodynamic sciatic sliding technique would improve
              hamstring flexibility to a greater degree than stretching or a
              placebo intervention in asymptomatic subjects with short
              hamstring syndrome (SHS). Study Design. Randomized double-blinded
              controlled trial. Methods. One hundred and twenty subjects with
              SHS were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: neurodynamic sliding,
              hamstring stretching, and placebo control. Each subject's
              dominant leg was measured for straight leg raise (SLR) range of
              motion (ROM) before and after interventions. Data were analyzed
              with a 3 $\times$ 2 mixed model ANOVA followed by simple main
              effects analyses. Results. At the end of the study, more ROM was
              observed in the Neurodynamic and Stretching groups compared to
              the Control group and more ROM in the Neurodynamic group compared
              to Stretching group. Conclusion. Findings suggest that a
              neurodynamic sliding technique will increase hamstring
              flexibility to a greater degree than static hamstring stretching
              in healthy subjects with SHS. Clinical Relevance. The use of
              neurodynamic sliding techniques to improve hamstring flexibility
              in sports may lead to a decreased incidence in injuries; however,
              this needs to be formally tested.",

              pain. Typically, clinicians rely on expert opinion in making
              decisions about when and how to implement lumbar traction. The
              purpose of this paper was to review current knowledge of lumbar
              traction and to identify what, if any, empirical evidence
              supports the expert opinions. This review found that whereas the
              mechanical effects of lumbar traction are well substantiated, the
              results of studies examining clinical effectiveness are
              conflicting. The failure to conclusively demonstrate the clinical
              benefit of lumbar traction may be related to the varied
              diagnostic categories and treatment techniques employed in the
              studies. Of the 10 types of lumbar traction described in the
              literature, static and intermittent mechanical traction are the
              two most commonly used. Indications, contraindications, and
              treatment techniques for these two types of traction are

              signal amplitude of the hip and back extensors, and the angle of
              anterior pelvic tilt during hip extension in the prone position.
              BACKGROUND:Prone hip extension is a commonly used position for
              testing hip extensors strength and performing hip extension
              exercises. Performing an ADIM during hip extension exercise in
              prone may reduce the activity of erector spinae and angle of
              anterior pelvic tilt and increase the activity of hip extensors.
              METHODS:Twenty ablebodied volunteers (10 male, 10 female), aged
              19 to 26 years (mean +/- SD, 22.3 +/- 3.4 years), were recruited
              for this study. The EMG signal amplitude and angle of anterior
              pelvic tilt were measured during prone hip extension with and
              without performing an ADIM. Surface EMG signal was recorded from
              the erector spinae, gluteus maximus, and medial hamstrings.
              Kinematic data for anterior pelvic tilt were measured using a
              motion analysis system. Data were analyzed using 2-way ANOVAs.
              RESULTS:When performing an ADIM during hip extension exercises
              done in a prone position, the EMO signal amplitude decreased
              significantly in the erector spinae (mean +/- SD, 49 +/- 14\%
              MVIC versus 17 +/- 12\% MVIC; P < .001), and increased
              significantly in both the gluteus maximus (mean +/- SD, 24 +/-
              8\% MVIC versus 52 +/- 15\% MVIC; P < .001) and medial hamstrings
              (mean +/- SD, 47 +/- 14\% MVIC versus 58 +/- 20\% MVIC; P =
              .008). The angle of anterior pelvic tilt decreased significantly
              during prone hip extension with an ADIM (mean +/- SD, 10 degrees
              +/- 2 degrees versus 3 degrees +/- 1 degree; P < .001).
              CONCLUSIONS:Based on these findings, an ADIM could be used as an
              effective methoc to disassociate erector spinae activation from
              gluteus maximus and medial hamstrings during prone hip extension

              approximately 17,000 men and women ages 20 to 59 years.
              OBJECTIVES:To describe care-seeking behavior for low back pain in
              a general population; to characterize pain, disability, and sick
              leave among the patients; and to study predictors of recovery. An
              additional aim was to find a simple way of classifying low back

              back pain is very common, but its natural history in a general
              population and predictors of recovery are not fully known.
              METHODS:All the patients went through a clinical examination, and
              data on personal, medical, and occupational history were
              collected. Follow-up assessments were made during a 2-year
              period. RESULTS:Whereas 50\% of the patients went to physicians
              and physiotherapists for treatment, 50\% went to other
              caregivers. Some improvements in pain and disability were
              reported after 3 months, but not many after that. Approximately
              70\% of the care seekers had not been on sick leave during the
              follow-up period. Care seeking during the follow-up period was
              not associated with reduced pain and disability. No predictive
              factors for recovery were found. A simple pain drawing made by
              the patient gave information about pain distribution similar to
              that found by clinical examination. CONCLUSIONS:In a general
              working population in Sweden ages 20-59 years, approximately 5\%
              sought care because of a new low back pain episode during a
              3-year period. Few of the care seekers became pain-free during
              the follow-up period. This study strengthens the hypothesis that
              low back pain often becomes chronic even when sick leave is rare.",

  abstract  = "Background:Physical therapy and opioid prescriptions are common
               after hip surgery, but are sometimes delayed or not used.
               Objective:The objective of this study was to compare downstream
               health care utilization and opioid use following hip surgery for
               different patterns of physical therapy and prescription opioids.
               Design:The design of this study was an observational cohort.
               Methods:Health care utilization was abstracted from the Military
               Health System Data Repository for patients who were 18 to 50
               years old and were undergoing arthroscopic hip surgery between
               2004 and 2013. Patients were grouped into those receiving an
               isolated treatment (only opioids or only physical therapy) and
               those receiving both treatments on the basis of timing (opioid
               first or physical therapy first). Outcomes included overall
               health care visits and costs, hip-related visits and costs,
               additional surgeries, and opioid prescriptions. Results:Of 1870
               total patients, 82.7\% (n = 1546) received physical therapy
               only, 71.6\% (n = 1339) received prescription opioids, and 1073
               (56.1\%) received both physical therapy and opioids. Because 24
               patients received both opioids and physical therapy on the same
               day, they were eventually removed the final timing-of-care
               analysis. Adjusted hip-related mean costs were the same in both
               groups receiving isolated treatments ($\{\$\}$11,628 vs
               $\{\$\}$11,579), but the group receiving only physical therapy
               had significantly lower overall total health care mean costs
               ($\{\$\}$18,185 vs $\{\$\}$23,842) and fewer patients requiring
               another hip surgery. For patients receiving both treatments,
               mean hip-related downstream costs were significantly higher in
               the group receiving opioids first than in the group receiving
               physical therapy first ($\{\$\}$18,806 vs $\{\$\}$16,955) and
               resulted in greater opioid use (7.83 vs 4.14 prescriptions),
               greater total days' supply of opioids (90.17 vs 44.30 days), and
               a higher percentage of patients with chronic opioid use (69.5\%
               vs 53.2\%). Limitations:Claims data were limited by the accuracy
               of coding, and observational data limit inferences of causality.
               Conclusions:Physical therapy first was associated with lower
               hip-related downstream costs and lower opioid use than opioids
               first; physical therapy instead of opioids was associated with
               less total downstream health care utilization. These results
               need to be validated in prospective controlled trials.",

  abstract = "Study Design Systematic review with meta-analysis. Background
              Lower-limb osteoarthritis (OA) is associated with pain and
              reduced function. Most research focuses on hip and knee OA-
              related impairments; consequently, impairments that characterize
              ankle OA are not well understood. Objective To systematically
              review available evidence of physical impairments in individuals
              with ankle OA. Methods A comprehensive search of electronic
              databases was conducted from their inception to July 2017.
              Studies were screened using predefined inclusion/exclusion
              criteria. Studies that compared physical measures (excluding
              gait) between individuals with ankle OA and healthy controls or
              the unaffected ankle were included. Two reviewers rated studies
              for quality. Meta-analyses with random effects were conducted
              when appropriate. Results Of 4565 identified studies (563
              participants), 8 satisfied the inclusion criteria and 3 studies
              were included in meta-analyses. All studies evaluated a range of
              impairments at end-stage OA, and exhibited poor reporting of
              missing data, assessor blinding, and measurement validity.
              Meta-analyses revealed large impairments of ankle sagittal plane
              motion and strength. Evidence from single studies indicated large
              deficits of ankle frontal plane motion and strength, talar
              translation and rotation on arthrometry, balance, and
              electromyography of ankle joint muscles. There were also abnormal
              bony alignments and greater fatty infiltrate in all calf muscle
              compartments. Conclusion The results of this literature review
              suggest significant ankle motion, strength, and functional
              impairments in individuals with ankle OA. The strength of the
              conclusions is limited, due to the small number and
              methodological limitations of published studies. Level of

              OBJECTIVE: To assess long-term outcomes of patients with lumbar
              spinal stenosis treated surgically or nonsurgically. SUMMARY OF
              BACKGROUND DATA: The relative benefit of various treatments for
              lumbar spinal stenosis is uncertain. Surgical treatment has been
              associated with short-term improvement, but recurrence of
              symptoms has been documented. Few studies have compared long-term
              outcomes of surgical and nonsurgical treatments. METHODS:
              Patients recruited from the practices of orthopaedic surgeons,
              neurosurgeons, and occupational medicine physicians throughout
              Maine had baseline interviews with follow-up questionnaires
              mailed at regular intervals over 10 years. Clinical data were
              obtained at baseline from a physician questionnaire. Most
              patients initially undergoing surgery had a laminectomy without
              fusion performed. Outcomes including patient-reported symptoms of
              leg and back pain, functional status, and satisfaction were
              assessed at 8- to 10-year follow-up. Primary analyses were based
              on initial treatment received with secondary analyses examining
              actual treatment received by 10 years. RESULTS: Of 148 eligible
              consenting patients initially enrolled, 105 were alive after 10
              years (67.7\% survival rate). Among surviving patients, long-term
              follow-up between 8 and 10 years was available for 97 of 123
              (79\%) patients (including 11 patients who died before the
              10-year follow-up but completed a 8 or 9 year survey); 56 of 63
              (89\%) initially treated surgically and 41 of 60 (68\%) initially
              treated nonsurgically. Patients undergoing surgery had worse
              baseline symptoms and functional status than those initially
              treated nonsurgically. Outcomes at 1 and 4 years favored initial
              surgical treatment. After 8 to 10 years, a similar percentage of
              surgical and nonsurgical patients reported that their low back
              pain was improved(53\% vs. 50\%, P = 0.8), their predominant
              symptom (either back or leg pain) was improved (54\% vs. 42\%, P
              = 0.3), and they were satisfied with their current status (55\%
              vs. 49\%, P = 0.5). These treatment group findings persisted
              after adjustment for other determinants of outcome in
              multivariate models. However, patients initially treated
              surgically reported less severe leg pain symptoms and greater
              improvement in back-specific functional status after 8 to 10
              years than nonsurgically treated patients. By 10 years, 23\% of
              surgical patients had undergone at least one additional lumbar
              spine operation, and 39\% of nonsurgical patients had at least
              one lumbar spine operation. Patients undergoing subsequent
              surgical procedures had worse outcomes than those continuing with
              their initial treatment. Outcomes according to actual treatment
              received at 10 years did not differ because individuals
              undergoing additional surgical procedures had worse outcomes than
              those continuing with their initial treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Among
              patients with lumbar spinal stenosis completing 8- to 10-year
              follow-up, low back pain relief, predominant symptom improvement,
              and satisfaction with the current state were similar in patients
              initially treated surgically or nonsurgically. However, leg pain
              relief and greater back-related functional status continued to
              favor those initially receiving surgical treatment. These results
              support a shared decision-making approach among physicians and
              patients when considering treatment options for lumbar spinal
              stenosis.",

              4-year period in patients with cervical radiculopathy to
              determine their response to conservative measures (cervical
              collar therapy and halter cervical traction). METHODS: Cervical
              radiculopathy was diagnosed in patients if they suffered from
              radiating arm pain made worse by neck movement and at least one
              of the following: reflex loss, dermatomal numbness, and/or
              myotomal weakness. Patients with neck pain alone or arm pain
              without neurological deficit were excluded from analysis. Those
              patients without excruciating pain, severe weakness, or evidence
              of myelopathy were offered a course of halter traction before
              surgery was to be considered. Ninety-six patients met the
              inclusion criteria; there were 61 males and 35 females, and the
              mean age was 47 years. Fifty-five patients presented with C-7, 37
              with C-6, two with C-5, and two with C-8 radiculopathy.
              Eighty-one patients underwent a trial of traction that consisted
              of wearing a cervical collar and home-based halter cervical
              traction: 8 to 12 pounds, applied for 15 minutes, three times a
              day for 3 to 6 weeks The mean duration of symptoms prior to
              neurosurgical evaluation was 43 days +/- 8.3 days (standard
              deviation). Sixty-three (78\%) of 81 patients responded to
              therapeutic traction, experiencing significant or total pain
              relief, three could not tolerate the traction, and traction
              failed in 15 patients. Of the 81 patients in whom traction was
              undertaken, 78 underwent magnetic resonance imaging prior to
              being seen, which revealed herniated discs at the corresponding
              levels in 71 and foraminal stenosis in seven. Three of the 63
              patients in whom an initial response to traction was noted
              suffered recurrence of symptoms and required surgery. It would
              appear that in patients in whom symptoms of cervical
              radiculopathy were present for approximately 6 weeks that 75\%
              will respond to further conservative treatment (halter traction
              and cervical collar) over the next 6 weeks.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE:The study purpose was to examine the relationship
              between state regulations of physical therapists (PT) and three
              dependent variables: physical therapist assistant (PTA)
              utilization more than 50 percent of the time during the treatment
              episode (high PTA utilization), number of visits, and patient
              self-reported functional health status (FHS) at discharge. We
              evaluated regulations governing licensure of PTAs, PT/PTA ratio,
              frequency of PT re-evaluation, and PTA supervision. DATA
              SOURCE:The analytic sample included 63,900 patients from 38
              states drawn from 395 clinics who participated in the Focus on
              Therapeutic Outcomes Inc. (Knoxville, TN) database in 2000 and
              2001. STUDY DESIGN:Using a Bayesian modeling approach with the
              Markov Chain Monte Carlo estimation method, we fitted separate
              multilevel multivariate regression models predicting high PTA
              utilization, number of visits, and discharge FHS. DATA COLLECTION
              METHODS:Patients completed FHS surveys at intake and discharge.
              Clinicians recorded the number of visits and percentage of time a
              patient spent with each provider. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:After
              controlling for patient, therapist, and clinic characteristics,
              the presence of state regulations regarding PTA supervision was
              not associated with the likelihood of high PTA utilization. High
              PTA utilization and regulations requiring full-time onsite
              supervision were associated with more visits, whereas regulation
              of PT/PTA ratio was associated with fewer visits. Supervisory
              regulations were associated with better discharge FHS. High PTA
              utilization and use of therapy aides were associated with more
              visits per episode and lower discharge FHS. CONCLUSIONS:The use
              of care extenders in place of PTs is likely to result in less
              efficient and lower quality care in outpatient rehabilitation.",

               identifying and dealing with more patients who are at high risk
               and who have psychological barriers to recovery is important yet
               difficult. Objectives:The objective of this study was to test
               physical therapists' ability to allocate patients into risk
               stratification groups, test correlations between therapists'
               assessments of psychological factors and patient questionnaires,
               and explore relationships between psychological factors and
               therapists' self-reported competence to manage patients with
               chronic LBP. Design:This was a pragmatic, observational study.
               Methods:Patients completed the STarT Back Tool (SBT, for risk
               stratification), the Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire
               (distress, depression, anxiety), and the Tampa Scale of
               Kinesiophobia (kinesiophobia) prior to the intake session. After
               this session, physical therapists estimated patient prognostic
               risk using the 3 SBT categories and rated patient psychological
               factors using a 0-to-10 scale. Finally, therapists reported
               their self-reported competence to manage the patient. Intraclass
               and Spearman rank correlations tested correlations between
               therapists' intuitive assessments and patient questionnaires. A
               linear mixed model explored relationships between psychological
               factors and therapists' self-reported competence.
               Results:Forty-nine patients were managed by 20 therapists.
               Therapists accurately estimated SBT risk allocation in only 41\%
               of patients. Correlations between therapist perceptions and
               patient questionnaires were moderate for distress (r = 0.602)
               and fair for depression (r = 0.304) and anxiety (r = 0.327).
               There was no correlation for kinesiophobia (r = -0.007). Patient
               distress was identified as a negative predictor of therapists'
               self-reported competence. Limitations:This was a cross-sectional
               study, conducted in only 1 center. Conclusions:Physical
               therapists were not very accurate at allocating patients into
               risk stratification groups or identifying psychological factors.
               Therapists' self-reported competence in managing patients was
               lowest when patients reported higher distress.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND:Chiropractors throughout the world by and large focus
               on patients with musculoskeletal complaints who are generally in
               good health. Currently, it is widely accepted that neck pain and
               low back pain are best understood as biopsychosocial phenomena.
               OBJECTIVE:The purpose of this study was to determine whether
               certain psychosocial factors provide added value for predicting
               recovery. DESIGN:This was a prospective, multicenter,
               chiropractic, practice-based cohort study in Belgium and the
               Netherlands. METHODS:A total of 917 participants, 326 with neck
               pain and 591 with low back pain, completed self-administered
               questionnaires at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. They
               provided information on several demographic, biomedical, and
               psychosocial variables. Lasting perceived recovery was used as
               the outcome measure, that is, recovery at all follow-up
               assessments from 3 months on. Twenty-seven potential predictors
               of outcome were used to build the predictive model. Stepwise,
               backward generalized estimating equation regression models were
               used to take into account the clustering of participants within
               practices. For assessment of the added value of psychosocial
               variables, 2 model fit indexes were compared. RESULTS:After the
               addition of psychosocial variables, predictors in the final
               model for neck pain included occupational status, body mass
               index, duration of complaints, previous treatment, and
               participant expectations (the model fit was marginally improved
               from 0.684 to 0.695 for the area under the curve and from 65.0\%
               to 66.1\% for the percentage correctly predicted). In the final
               model for low back pain, the selected predictors included
               country of treatment, age, duration of complaints, previous
               imaging, and somatization (the area under the curve changed from
               0.669 to 0.715, and the percentage correctly predicted changed
               from 68.6\% to 69.5\%). Only a minority of participants had high
               scores on psychological variables. LIMITATIONS:The reliability
               and validity of lasting recovery as an outcome measure have not
               been tested. The cohort needs to be seen as a convenience
               sample. Selection bias, therefore, not be ruled out. There are
               no indications, however, that patients with complex psychosocial
               profiles were excluded from this study. CONCLUSIONS:Psychosocial
               variables provided little added value for predicting outcome in
               people who had neck pain or low back pain and sought
               chiropractic care. Therefore, chiropractors should not screen
               extensively for them at baseline. With regard to the
               identification of the small subgroup of people with high scores
               on psychosocial variables and a high risk for chronic pain,
               further investigation is needed.",

              laminectomy/discectomy and lumbar fusion for fee-for-service
              Medicare beneficiaries over age 65 in each of the 306 US Hospital
              Referral Regions between 1992 and 2003. RESULTS:Lumbar fusion
              rates have increased steadily since 1992 (0.3 per 1000 enrollees
              in 1992 to 1.1 per 1000 enrollees in 2003). Regional rates of
              lumbar discectomy, laminectomy, and fusion in 1992-1993 were
              highly correlated to rates of discectomy, laminectomy (R2 =
              0.44), and fusion (R2 = 0.28) in 2002-2003. There was a nearly
              8-fold variation in regional rates of lumbar discectomy and
              laminectomy in 2002 and 2003. In the case of lumbar fusion, there
              was nearly a 20-fold range in rates among Medicare enrollees in
              2002 and 2003. This represents the largest coefficient of
              variation seen with any surgical procedure. Medicare spending for
              inpatient back surgery more than doubled over the decade.
              Spending for lumbar fusion increased more than 500\%, from 75
              million dollars to 482 million dollars. In 1992, lumbar fusion
              represented 14\% of total spending for back surgery; by 2003,
              lumbar fusion accounted for 47\% of spending. CONCLUSIONS:The
              rate of specific procedures within a region or ``surgical
              signature'' is remarkably stable over time. However, there has
              been a marked increase in rates of fusion, and a coincident shift
              and increase in cost. Rates of back surgery were not correlated
              with the per-capita supply of orthopedic and neurosurgeons.",

               dominance of neurophysiological dysfunction within the central
               nervous system. Symptoms and signs associated with an assumed
               dominance of CSP in patients attending for physiotherapy have
               not been extensively studied. The purpose of this study was to
               identify symptoms and signs associated with a clinical
               classification of CSP in patients with low back ($\pm$ leg)
               pain. Using a cross-sectional, between-subjects design; four
               hundred and sixty-four patients with low back ($\pm$ leg) pain
               were assessed using a standardised assessment protocol.
               Patients' pain was assigned a mechanisms-based classification
               based on experienced clinical judgement. Clinicians then
               completed a clinical criteria checklist specifying the presence
               or absence of various clinical criteria. A binary logistic
               regression analysis with Bayesian model averaging identified a
               cluster of three symptoms and one sign predictive of CSP,
               including: 'Disproportionate, non-mechanical, unpredictable
               pattern of pain provocation in response to multiple/non-specific
               aggravating/easing factors', 'Pain disproportionate to the
               nature and extent of injury or pathology', 'Strong association
               with maladaptive psychosocial factors (e.g. negative emotions,
               poor self-efficacy, maladaptive beliefs and pain behaviours)'
               and 'Diffuse/non-anatomic areas of pain/tenderness on
               palpation'. This cluster was found to have high levels of
               classification accuracy (sensitivity 91.8\%, 95\% confidence
               interval (CI): 84.5-96.4; specificity 97.7\%, 95\% CI:
               95.6-99.0). Pattern recognition of this empirically-derived
               cluster of symptoms and signs may help clinicians identify an
               assumed dominance of CSP in patients with low back pain
               disorders in a way that might usefully inform their management.",

  abstract  = "Pain reduction is a primary goal of physical therapy for
               patients who present with acute or persistent pain conditions.
               The purpose of this review is to describe a mechanism-based
               approach to physical therapy pain management. It is increasingly
               clear that patients need to be evaluated for changes in
               peripheral tissues and nociceptors, neuropathic pain signs and
               symptoms, reduced central inhibition and enhanced central
               excitability, psychosocial factors, and alterations of the
               movement system. In this Perspective, 5 categories of pain
               mechanisms (nociceptive, central, neuropathic, psychosocial, and
               movement system) are defined, and principles on how to evaluate
               signs and symptoms for each mechanism are provided. In addition,
               the underlying mechanisms targeted by common physical therapist
               treatments and how they affect each of the 5 categories are
               described. Several different mechanisms can simultaneously
               contribute to a patient's pain; alternatively, 1 or 2 primary
               mechanisms may cause a patient's pain. Further, within a single
               pain mechanism, there are likely many possible subgroups. For
               example, reduced central inhibition does not necessarily
               correlate with enhanced central excitability. To individualize
               care, common physical therapist interventions, such as
               education, exercise, manual therapy, and transcutaneous
               electrical nerve stimulation, can be used to target specific
               pain mechanisms. Although the evidence elucidating these pain
               mechanisms will continue to evolve, the approach outlined here
               provides a conceptual framework for applying new knowledge as
               advances are made.",

              individual examination items and a classification decision-making
              algorithm using physical therapists with varying levels of
              experience. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:Classifying patients based
              on clusters of examination findings has shown promise for
              improving outcomes. Examining the reliability of examination
              items and the classification decision-making algorithm may
              improve the reproducibility of classification methods.
              METHODS:Patients with low back pain less than 90 days in duration
              participating in a randomized trial were examined on separate
              days by different examiners. Interrater reliability of individual
              examination items important for classification was examined in
              clinically stable patients using kappa coefficients and
              intraclass correlation coefficients. The findings from the first
              examination were used to classify each patient using the
              decision-making algorithm by clinicians with varying amounts of
              experience. The reliability of the classification algorithm was
              examined with kappa coefficients. RESULTS:A total of 123 patients
              participated (mean age 37.7 [+/-10.7] years, 44\% female), 60
              (49\%) remained stable between examinations. Reliability of range
              of motion, centralization/peripheralization judgments with
              flexion and extension, and the instability test were moderate to
              excellent. Reliability of centralization/peripheralization
              judgments with repeated or sustained extension or aberrant
              movement judgments were fair to poor. Overall agreement on
              classification decisions was 76\% (kappa = 0.60, 95\% confidence
              interval 0.56, 0.64), with no significant differences based on
              level of experience. CONCLUSION:Reliability of the classification
              algorithm was good. Further research is needed to identify
              sources of disagreements and improve reproducibility.",

              OBJECTIVE:The goal of our current study is to raise awareness on
              complications associated with anterior cervical discectomy and
              fusion (ACDF) and their early detection and proper management.
              SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:It is known that ACDF constitutes one
              of the most commonly performed spinal procedures. Its outcome is
              quite satisfactory in the majority of cases. However, occasional
              complications can become troublesome, and in rare circumstances,
              catastrophic. Although there are several case reports describing
              such complications, their rate of occurrence is generally
              underreported, and data regarding their exact incidence in large
              clinical series are lacking. Meticulous knowledge of potential
              intraoperative and postoperative ACDF-related complications is of
              paramount importance so as to avoid them whenever possible, as
              well as to successfully and safely manage them when they are
              inevitable. METHODS:In a retrospective study, 1015 patients
              undergoing first-time ACDF for cervical radiculopathy and/or
              myelopathy due to degenerative disc disease and/or cervical
              spondylosis were evaluated. A standard Smith-Robinson approach
              was used in all our patients, while an autologous or allograft
              was used, with or without a plate. Operative reports, hospital
              and outpatient clinic charts, and radiographic studies were
              reviewed for procedure-related complications. Mean follow-up time
              was 26.4 months. RESULTS:The mortality rate in our current series
              was 0.1\% (1 of 1015 patients, death occurred secondary to an
              esophageal perforation). Our overall morbidity rate was 19.3\%
              (196 of 1015 patients). The most common complication was the
              development of isolated postoperative dysphagia, which observed
              in 9.5\% of our patients. Postoperative hematoma occurred in
              5.6\%, but required surgical intervention in only 2.4\% of our
              cases. Symptomatic recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy occurred in
              3.1\% of our cases. Dural penetration occurred in 0.5\%,
              esophageal perforation in 0.3\%, worsening of preexisting
              myelopathy in 0.2\%, Horner's syndrome in 0.1\%, instrumentation
              backout in 0.1\%, and superficial wound infection in 0.1\% of our
              cases. CONCLUSION:Meticulous knowledge of the ACDF-associated
              complications allows for their proper management. Postoperative
              dysphagia, hematoma, and recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy were the
              most common complications in our series. Management of
              complications was successful in the vast majority of our cases.",

  abstract = "STUDY DESIGN:Literature review of quality of clinical trials.
              OBJECTIVE:To determine the methodological quality of published
              randomized controlled trials that used spinal manipulation and/or
              mobilization to treat patients with tension-type headache (TTH),
              cervicogenic headache (CeH), and migraine (M) in the last decade.
              BACKGROUND:TTH, CeH, and M are the most prevalent types of
              headaches seen in adults. Individuals who have headaches
              frequently use physical therapy, manual therapy, or chiropractic
              care. Randomized controlled trials are considered an optimal
              method with which to assess the efficacy of any intervention.
              METHODS:Computerized literature searches were performed in
              MEDLINE, EMBASE, COCHRANE, AMED, MANTIS, CINHAL, and PEDro
              databases. Randomized controlled trials in which spinal
              manipulation and/or mobilization had been used for TTH, CeH, and
              M published in a peer-reviewed journal as full text, and with at
              least 1 clinically relevant outcome measure (ie, headache
              intensity, duration, or frequency) were reviewed. The
              methodological quality of the studies was assessed independently
              by 2 reviewers using a set of predefined criteria. RESULTS:Only 8
              studies met all the inclusion criteria. One clinical trial
              evaluated spinal manipulation and mobilization together, and the
              remaining 7 assessed spinal manipulative therapy. No controlled
              trials analyzing exclusively the effects of spinal mobilization
              were found. Methodological scores ranged from 35 to 56 points out
              of a theoretical maximum of 100 points, indicating an overall
              poor methodology of the studies. Only 2 studies obtained a
              high-quality score (greater than 50 points). No significant
              differences in quality scores were found based on the type of
              headache investigated. Methodological quality was not associated
              with the year of publication (before 2000, or later) nor with the
              results (positive, neutral, negative) reported in the studies.
              The most common flaws were a small sample size, the absence of a
              placebo control group, lack of blinded patients, and no
              description of the manipulative procedure. CONCLUSIONS:There are
              few published randomized controlled trials analyzing the
              effectiveness of spinal manipulation and/or mobilization for TTH,
              CeH, and M in the last decade. In addition, the methodological
              quality of these papers is typically low. Clearly, there is a
              need for high-quality randomized controlled trials assessing the
              effectiveness of these interventions in these headache disorders.",

              expanding rapidly in the United States and globally. The
              publication of competencies from the Interprofessional Education
              Collaborative (IPEC) was a significant step forward to recognize
              the importance of health professions collaboration and to guide
              institutions for educational program development. However, there
              remains substantial difficulty in implementation, as well as
              considerable variability in assessment of learners'
              interprofessional collaborative knowledge and skills and
              evaluation of IPE programs. METHODS:We conducted a multi-methods
              project which included 20 key informant interviews, a literature
              review, and a meeting of an expert panel. Our goals were 1)
              explore the current field of IPE, 2) identify and disseminate
              best practices to institutions wishing to implement/augment IPE
              assessment and evaluation processes, 3) uncover gaps in current
              IPE assessment and evaluation practices, and 4) recommend next
              steps for the field. RESULTS:A small and growing literature
              indicates evidence of the effectiveness of IPE. A diverse
              collection of methods and tools are used to assess and evaluate
              IPE learners and programs; these are often used without an
              explicit program-evaluation framework. CONCLUSIONS:For the field
              to advance and to align with the demands of changing clinical
              care systems, robust assessment and evaluation methods,
              standardized use of common tools, and longitudinal assessment
              from diverse data streams are needed for IPE.",

               often strive to be person-centered, for example, by focusing on
               participation and valuing patient empowerment. However, the
               available evidence has mostly been constructed around
               populations (or study samples) rather than individuals. In this
               perspective, an alternative evidence framework is described,
               constructed around measurements in routine practice.
               Specifically, the authors propose developing ``people-like-me''
               reference charts, generated with historical outcomes data, to
               provide real-time information on an individual's status relative

               could work using their experience with people rehabilitating

               stakeholders (eg, patients, clinicians) need to be identified
               and monitored longitudinally to ensure that ``people-like-me''
               estimates are useful and support the goals of person-centered
               care. Statistical methods for selecting ``people-like-me'' need
               to be examined and refined. Finally, the ``people-like-me''
               information needs to be packaged in such a way that it is
               accessible, intuitive, and helpful at the point of care.
               Ideally, the entire process should recognize from the outset
               that practice patterns evolve, so databases, statistical models,
               and decision tools should be dynamic by design. Ultimately, the
               authors propose this framework as a practical mechanism to
               advance person-centered decisions in physical therapy according
               to the ideals of evidence-based practice.",

               (LBP); the most commonly used among physiotherapists involves a
               pathoanatomical/pathophysiological tissue classification system.
               Few studies have examined whether this form of classification of
               LBP disorders can be performed in a reliable manner between
               specialists with advanced training, or between specialists with
               advanced training and non-specialists who lack advanced
               training. The purpose of this paper was to examine the
               inter-tester reliability of two specialists, and the ability of
               a specialist and non-specialist to independently classify
               patients with LBP, utilizing clinical tests and history-based
               classification methods after a short educational course on the
               classification system. Subjects were acute or sub-acute patients
               with LBP who visited their occupational healthcare or municipal
               healthcare center. Inter-tester reliability between the
               specialist and non-specialists was at almost the same level:
               overall Kappa 0.60 (95\%CI; 0.40 to 0.85), overall agreement
               70\%, as between the two specialists: overall Kappa 0.65
               (95\%CI; 0.33-0.86), overall agreement 77\%. The findings
               suggest that a short educational course can provide rather
               reliable examination tools to allow non-specialized
               physiotherapists to classify patients according to tissue

               INTERVENTIONS:Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE:Demolition
               derby neck pain questionnaire. RESULTS:Forty drivers
               participated in a mean of 30 career events and had an average of
               52 car collisions per event, 55\% being rear-end. Mean and
               maximum collision speeds were 26 and 45 miles/h (41.6 km/h, 72
               km/h), respectively. Only 2 drivers reported their worst
               postparticipation neck pain lasted more than 3 months, and for 1
               it lasted more than a year; for the majority, the worst neck
               pain event lasted less than 21 days. Three participants reported
               having mild chronic persistent derby-related neck pain (never
               went away). The remaining 37 drivers reported no chronic neck
               pain. The average pain episode was moderate or severe for 8, but
               for all respondents, the average pain episodes lasted less than
               21 days. Ten reported chronic neck pain they believed was
               unrelated to derby competition (7 mild, 2 moderate, 1 severe).
               CONCLUSIONS:These data suggest that derby drivers sustain less
               chronic neck pain after multiple car collision events than might
               otherwise be expected. Further study of this unique population

              experienced by osteoarthritis (OA) patients. A systematic review
              following PRISMA guidelines was performed to evaluate the
              existing evidence from the literature related to the presence of
              central sensitization (CS) in patients with OA.Electronic
              databases PubMed and Web of Science were searched to identify
              relevant articles using pre-defined keywords regarding CS and OA.
              Full-text clinical reports addressing studies of CS in human
              adults with chronic complaints due to osteoarthritis were
              included and screened for methodological quality by two
              independent reviewers. From the 40 articles that were initially
              eligible for methodological quality assessment, 36 articles
              achieved sufficient scores and therefore were discussed. The
              majority of these studies were case-control studies and addressed
              OA of the knee joint. Different subjective and objective
              parameters considered manifestations of CS, which have been

              plays a significant role in a subgroup of subjects within this
              population. Although the majority of the literature provides
              evidence for the presence of CS in chronic OA pain, clinical
              identification and treatment of CS in OA is still in its infancy,

               Patients with cervical radiculopathy can be included or excluded

               tests (Spurling test, traction/distraction test, and Upper Limb

               about patients' limitations, course of pain, and prognostic
               factors (eg, coping style) and answers to health-related
               questions.In case of a normal recovery (treatment profile A),
               management should be hands-off, and patients should receive
               advice from the physical therapist and possibly some simple
               exercises to supplement ``acting as usual.''In case of a
               delayed/deviant recovery (treatment profile B), the physical

               manipulation in combination with exercise therapy. Other

               electrotherapy, ultrasound, traction, and/or a cervical
               collar.In case of a delayed/deviant recovery with clear and/or
               dominant psychosocial prognostic factors (treatment profile C),
               these factors should first be addressed by the physical
               therapist, when possible, or the patient should be referred to a
               specialist, when necessary.In case of neck pain grade III
               (treatment profile D), the therapy resembles that for profile B,
               but the use of a cervical collar for pain reduction may be
               considered. The advice is to use it sparingly: only for a short

              determine the natural history of spondylolysis and
              spondylolisthesis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:Most studies on the
              natural history of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis are based
              on patient populations presenting with pain. Critical to any
              natural history investigation is the study of a population of
              affected individuals, whether symptomatic or not, from onset of
              the condition through their lives. METHODS:By study of a
              population from the age of 6 years to adulthood, 30 individuals
              were identified to have pars lesions. Data collection at a
              45-year follow-up assessment included magnetic resonance imaging,
              a back pain questionnaire, and the SF-36 Survey. RESULTS:No
              subject with a pars defect was lost to follow-up evaluation once
              a lesion was identified. Subjects with unilateral defects never
              experienced slippage over the course of the study. Progression of
              spondylolisthesis slowed with each decade. There was no
              association of slip progression and low back pain. There was no
              statistically significant difference between the study population
              SF-36 scores and those of the general population the same age.
              CONCLUSIONS:This report is the only prospective study to document
              the natural history of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis from
              onset through more than 45 years of life in a population
              unselected for pain. Subjects with pars defects follow a clinical
              course similar to that of the general population. There appears
              to be a marked slowing of slip progression with each decade, and
              no subject has reached a 40\% slip.",

              displacement and strain. OBJECTIVE:To determine the role of
              foraminal ligaments by examining differences in cervical nerve
              root displacement and strain during upper limb neural tension
              testing (ULNTT) before and after selective cutting of foraminal
              ligaments. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:Although investigators have
              determined that lumbar spine foraminal ligaments limit
              displacement and strain of lumbosacral nerve roots, similar
              studies have not been conducted to prove that it is true for the
              cervical region. Because the size, shape, and orientation of
              cervical spine foraminal ligaments are similar to those in the
              lumbar spine, it is hypothesized that foraminal ligaments in the
              cervical spine will function in a similar fashion.
              METHODS:Radiolucent markers were implanted into cervical nerve
              roots C5-C8 of 9 unembalmed cadavers. Posteroanterior
              fluoroscopic images were captured at resting and upper limb
              neural tension testing positioning before and after selective
              cutting of foraminal ligaments. RESULTS:Selective cutting of
              foraminal ligaments resulted in significant increases in
              inferolateral displacement (average, 2.94 mm [ligaments
              intact]-3.87 mm [ligaments cut], P < 0.05) and strain (average,
              9.33\% [ligaments intact]-16.31\% [ligaments cut], P < 0.03) of
              cervical nerve roots C5-C8 during upper limb neural tension
              testing. CONCLUSION:Foraminal ligaments in the cervical spine
              limited cervical nerve root displacement and strain during upper
              limb neural tension testing. Foraminal ligaments seem to have a
              protective role, reducing displacement and strain to cervical
              nerve roots during tension events. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:2.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND:In physical therapist education, the National
               Physical Therapy Examination (NPTE) is the predominant measure
               of student success. Because the NPTE is a high-stakes
               examination, predicting NPTE performance is important for
               physical therapist students and programs. PURPOSE:The purpose of
               this study was to determine the relationships between first
               attempt NPTE performance, physical therapist applicant
               variables, and physical therapist student variables. The 4
               identified physical therapist applicant variables were
               undergraduate cumulative grade point average (GPA),
               undergraduate GPA for prerequisite courses, Graduate Record
               Examination verbal and quantitative subscale scores, and
               admission scores. The 4 identified physical therapist student
               variables were first- and third-year physical therapist student
               GPA, clinical performance scores (first and final clinical
               experiences), noncognitive student variables, and comprehensive
               examination scores. DATA SOURCES:A systematic search was
               performed using the databases PubMed and EBSCO (1966-2018).
               STUDY SELECTION:Studies included in the review met the following
               criteria: the physical therapist education program offered an
               entry-level master's or doctorate degree, pertinent data were
               available for each independent variable, the relationship
               between the independent variable and the NPTE was investigated,
               the NPTE was a continuous variable, the program was a US
               entry-level therapist education program, and the study was peer
               reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION:Two independent reviewers completed
               data extraction and quality appraisal using the McMaster
               Appraisal Tool. DATA SYNTHESIS:Random-effects meta-analyses
               using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient as the
               measure of effect size was used. LIMITATIONS:Limitations of the
               review included a lack of homogeneity, high NPTE pass rates,
               modifications to the McMaster Appraisal Tool, small sample
               sizes, and publication bias. CONCLUSIONS:No one physical
               therapist applicant variable should be used as an independent
               predictor of first attempt NPTE performance. For physical
               therapist students, first- and third-year physical therapist
               student GPA had a strong relationship with first attempt NPTE
               performance; clinical performance had a weak and nonsignificant
               relationship with first attempt NPTE performance.",

              gender differences in coping are associated with long-lasting
              neck pain after acute whiplash. Seven hundred and forty
              participants referred from emergency departments or general
              practitioners after car accidents in Denmark. Within a median of
              five days, post-collision participants completed questionnaires
              on collision characteristics, psychological distress, and
              socio-demographics. After 3 months they completed the Coping
              Strategies Questionnaire, and after 12 months a VAS scale on neck
              pain intensity. RESULTS:The odds for long-lasting neck pain were
              more than twice as high for women than for men (OR = 2.17 (95\%
              CI: 1.40; 3.37). However, no gender difference in coping and no
              interaction between gender and the five coping subscales on neck
              pain after 12 months were found. 'Distraction' increased the odds
              for considerable neck pain for both men and women (OR = 1.03
              (95\% CI: 1.01; 1.05), 'reinterpreting' (OR = 1.03 (95\% CI:
              1.01; 1.06), 'catastrophizing' (OR = 1.14 (95\% CI: 1.10; 1.18),

              each point on these scales. CONCLUSIONS:No interaction between
              coping and gender on neck pain was found, thus different coping
              strategies 3 months post-collision did not explain the different
              prognosis observed in men and women. Clinically relevant
              influence of 'catastrophizing' and 'praying and hoping' to
              prognosis was found, therefore we should identify patients
              predominantly using these strategies.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND:Low-back pain with leg pain (sciatica) may be caused
              by a herniated intervertebral disc exerting pressure on the nerve
              root. Most patients will respond to conservative treatment, but
              in carefully selected patients, surgical discectomy may provide
              faster relief of symptoms. Primary care clinicians use patient
              history and physical examination to evaluate the likelihood of
              disc herniation and select patients for further imaging and
              possible surgery. OBJECTIVES:(1) To assess the performance of
              tests performed during physical examination (alone or in
              combination) to identify radiculopathy due to lower lumbar disc
              herniation in patients with low-back pain and sciatica;(2) To
              assess the influence of sources of heterogeneity on diagnostic
              performance. SEARCH STRATEGY:We searched electronic databases for
              primary studies: PubMed (includes MEDLINE), EMBASE, and CINAHL,
              and (systematic) reviews: PubMed and Medion (all from earliest
              until 30 April 2008), and checked references of retrieved
              articles. SELECTION CRITERIA:We considered studies if they
              compared the results of tests performed during physical
              examination on patients with back pain with those of diagnostic
              imaging (MRI, CT, myelography) or findings at surgery. DATA
              COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:Two review authors assessed the quality
              of each publication with the QUADAS tool, and extracted details
              on patient and study design characteristics, index tests and
              reference standard, and the diagnostic two-by-two table. We
              presented information on sensitivities and specificities with
              95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) for all aspects of physical
              examination. Pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were
              computed for subsets of studies showing sufficient clinical and
              statistical homogeneity. MAIN RESULTS:We included 16 cohort
              studies (median N = 126, range 71 to 2504) and three case control
              studies (38 to100 cases). Only one study was carried out in a
              primary care population. When used in isolation, diagnostic
              performance of most physical tests (scoliosis, paresis or muscle
              weakness, muscle wasting, impaired reflexes, sensory deficits)
              was poor. Some tests (forward flexion, hyper-extension test, and
              slump test) performed slightly better, but the number of studies
              was small. In the one primary care study, most tests showed
              higher specificity and lower sensitivity compared to other
              settings.Most studies assessed the Straight Leg Raising (SLR)
              test. In surgical populations, characterized by a high prevalence
              of disc herniation (58\% to 98\%), the SLR showed high
              sensitivity (pooled estimate 0.92, 95\% CI: 0.87 to 0.95) with
              widely varying specificity (0.10 to 1.00, pooled estimate 0.28,
              95\% CI: 0.18 to 0.40). Results of studies using imaging showed
              more heterogeneity and poorer sensitivity. The crossed SLR showed
              high specificity (pooled estimate 0.90, 95\% CI: 0.85 to 0.94)
              with consistently low sensitivity (pooled estimate 0.28, 95\% CI:
              0.22 to 0.35).Combining positive test results increased the
              specificity of physical tests, but few studies presented data on
              test combinations. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:When used in isolation,
              current evidence indicates poor diagnostic performance of most
              physical tests used to identify lumbar disc herniation. However,
              most findings arise from surgical populations and may not apply
              to primary care or non-selected populations. Better performance
              may be obtained when tests are combined.",

              randomized clinical trial compared a 6-session CBT intervention
              delivered in conjunction with the usual TMD treatment to the
              usual conservative treatment by TMD specialist dentists. For

              used to target patients with elevated levels of TMD pain-related
              interference with daily activities, independent of physical
              diagnosis (i.e., Axis I). RESULTS:At the post-treatment
              assessment, about 4 months after the baseline evaluations, the
              comprehensive care group, when compared to the usual treatment
              group, showed significantly lower levels of characteristic pain
              intensity, significantly higher self-reported ability to control
              their TMD pain, and a strong trend (P = .07) toward lower
              pain-related interference in daily activities. From
              post-intervention to 1-year follow-up, all subjects showed
              improvement. At the 1-year follow-up, the comprehensive care
              group, while not losing any of its early gains, was not
              significantly different from the usual care group with regard to
              reported levels of pain, ability to control pain, and levels of
              interference in activities. For many of these psychosocially
              disabled TMD patients, pain and interference 1 year after
              treatment remained at the same or higher levels than those
              observed at baseline among a group of patients selected for a
              separate randomized clinical trial on the basis of better
              psychosocial adaptation. CONCLUSION:The 6-session CBT
              intervention for patients with heightened psychologic and
              psychosocial disability was effective in improving pain-related
              variables over the course of the CBT in conjunction with usual
              treatment, but was too brief an intervention to result in further
              improvement after the sessions ended. Patient ratings of
              treatment satisfaction and helfulness were high for both groups,

              Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) for its ability to
              predict 6-month outcomes for patients with low back pain (LBP)
              participating in physical therapy clinical trials.
              BACKGROUND:Consistent evidence suggests that fear-avoidance
              beliefs are predictive of short-term outcomes for patients with
              LBP. However, proposed cut-off scores have not been widely
              investigated for longer-term outcomes in samples of patients
              receiving physical therapy. METHODS AND MEASURES:Subjects (n =
              160) were participants in 2 separate randomized trials that used
              standard methodology and investigated the efficacy of physical
              therapy interventions for LBP. Subjects completed baseline
              measures of pain, disability, fear-avoidance beliefs, and
              physical impairment. They completed 4 weeks of randomly assigned
              physical therapy and were reassessed at 6 months with standard
              examination techniques. The accuracy of previously proposed
              cut-offs for elevated FABQ scores were determined by independent
              t tests and chi-square analysis on raw 6-month Oswestry
              Disability Questionnaire (ODQ) scores, 6-month ODQ change scores,
              and minimally clinical important difference (MCID) in ODQ scores
              (6 points). Next, a hierarchical regression model determined
              which FABQ scale better predicted 6-month ODQ scores after
              controlling for previously reported prognostic factors and
              relevant treatment parameters. Last, receiver operating
              characteristic curve analyses were planned to generate a range of
              FABQ cut-off scores that predicted 6-month MCID in the ODQ.
              RESULTS:The previously reported cut-off score for the FABQ
              physical activity scale (>14) resulted in 111 (69.4\%) of 160
              patients being classified as having elevated baseline scores,
              while the previously reported cut-off score for the FABQ work
              scale (>29) resulted in 19 (11.9\%) of 160 patients being
              classified as having elevated baseline scores. Patients with
              elevated FABQ physical activity scale scores (>14) had no
              significant differences in 6-month ODQ outcomes. Patients with
              elevated FABQ work scale (>29) scores reported higher 6-month ODQ
              scores and were more likely to have reported no improvement in
              ODQ score. The final regression model explained 24.4\% of the
              variance in 6-month ODQ scores, with only manipulation and
              exercise and the FABQ work scale as unique predictors. Fifteen of
              the subjects (12.7\%) had a 6-month change in ODQ that indicated
              no improvement. The area under the receiver operating
              characteristic curve for the FABQ physical activity scale
              predicting this outcome was 0.562 (95\% CI: 0.415-0.710) and for
              the FABQ work scale was 0.694 (95\% CI: 0.542-0.846). Cut-off
              scores were explored for the FABQ work scale only, with positive
              likelihood ratios that ranged from 1.19 to 5.15 and negative
              likelihood ratios that ranged from 0.30 to 0.83. CONCLUSIONS:The
              FABQ work scale was the better predictor of self-report of
              disability in this sample of patients participating in physical
              therapy clinical trials. Future studies are necessary to further
              test and refine the FABQ work scale as a screening tool alone,
              and in combination with other examination findings.",

              stabilization exercises are a popular form of physiotherapy
              management for LBP, and previous small-scale studies on specific
              LBP subgroups have identified improvement in outcomes as a
              result. METHODS:A total of 97 patients (18-60 years old) with
              recurrent LBP were recruited. Stratified randomization was
              undertaken into 2 groups: ``conventional,'' physiotherapy
              consisting of general active exercise and manual therapy; and
              conventional physiotherapy plus specific spinal stabilization
              exercises. Stratifying variables used were laterality of
              symptoms, duration of symptoms, and Roland Morris Disability
              Questionnaire score at baseline. Both groups received The Back
              Book, by Roland et al. Back-specific functional disability
              (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire) at 12 months was the
              primary outcome. Pain, quality of life, and psychologic measures
              were also collected at 6 and 12 months. Analysis was by intention
              to treat. RESULTS:A total of 68 patients (70\%) provided 12-month
              follow-up data. Both groups showed improved physical functioning,
              reduced pain intensity, and an improvement in the physical
              component of quality of life. Mean change in physical
              functioning, measured by the Roland Morris Disability
              Questionnaire, was -5.1 (95\% confidence interval -6.3 to -3.9)
              for the specific spinal stabilization exercises group and -5.4
              (95\% confidence interval -6.5 to -4.2) for the conventional
              physiotherapy group. No statistically significant differences
              between the 2 groups were shown for any of the outcomes measured,
              at any time. CONCLUSIONS:Patients with LBP had improvement with
              both treatment packages to a similar degree. There was no
              additional benefit of adding specific spinal stabilization
              exercises to a conventional physiotherapy package for patients
              with recurrent LBP.",

              currently accounts for 2\% to 3\% of all cases of disability, and
              the numbers are rising. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
              (NSAIDs) are widely used, with 75 million prescriptions annually
              in the United States and 25 million in the United Kingdom. The
              volume of side effects noted, most of which are gastrointestinal

              in relation to the estimated prevalence of osteoarthritis (OA),
              where pain relief may be considered more important than an
              anti-inflammatory effect. There are conflicting data about the
              efficacy of NSAIDs compared with analgesics alone for pain
              relief. However, the interpretation of data comparing the two
              drug classes is limited by shortcomings in research methodologies
              and by difficulties in incorporating the anti-inflammatory effect
              of NSAIDs into the outcomes. The efficacy of paracetamol for some
              patients has been underestimated; however, although those with
              mild disease may find paracetamol adequate, most patients with OA
              are likely to gain more benefit from NSAIDs.",

              (LBP) in Spain from a societal perspective, including direct and
              indirect costs, based on a national representative sample of the
              general population, the National Health Survey of 2017 (NHS
              2017). OBJECTIVE:To estimate the costs attributable to LBP in
              Spain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:LBP has a high prevalence and
              is associated with lower quality of life, functional status, and
              increased use of health services. Studies that assess the
              socio-economic burden of LBP from a general population
              perspective have not been published yet in Spain. METHODS:Data
              from NHS 2017 were used. Direct costs (consultations-general
              practitioner, specialist and emergency departments-, diagnostic
              tests, hospitalizations, physiotherapy, psychologist, and
              medication consumption) and indirect costs (absenteeism and
              presenteeism) were assessed. Multivariate models were obtained to
              determine the independent attributable effect of LBP in each
              variable. Costs were determined through existing regional
              healthcare services public data. RESULTS:Prevalence of LBP was
              17.1\% for men and 24.5\% for women, and increased with age, low
              educational status, higher body mass index, and was associated
              with less physical activity, and lower self-perceived health.
              Multivariate analysis demonstrated that LBP was independently
              associated with a significant increase both in the utilization of
              all health services and on work day losses. Attributable costs of
              LBP were 8945.6 million euros, of which 74.5\% implied indirect
              costs, representing overall 0.68\% of Spanish Gross Domestic
              Product. CONCLUSION:Spain is paying a heavy price for LBP, mostly
              associated with its significant impact on absenteeism and
              presenteeism, as well as a noteworthy effect on excess health
              services utilization. These findings underscore the need to
              address this considerable public health and social problem
              through interventions that address widely LBP and that have
              demonstrated to be cost-effective. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:3.",

               expertise have been developed through research on physical
               therapists sampled solely on the basis of years of experience or
               reputation. Expert clinicians, selected on the basis of their
               patients' outcomes, have not been previously studied, nor have
               the patient outcomes of peer-nominated experts been analyzed.
               The purpose of our study was to describe characteristics of
               therapists who were classified as expert or average therapists
               based on the outcomes of their patients. SUBJECTS:Subjects were
               6 therapists classified as expert and 6 therapists classified as
               average through retrospective analysis of an outcomes database.
               METHODS:The study was guided by grounded theory method, using a
               multiple case study design. Analysis integrated data from
               quantitative and qualitative sources and developed a grounded
               theory. RESULTS:All therapists expressed a commitment to
               professional growth and an ethic of caring. Therapists
               classified as expert were not distinguished by years of
               experience, but they differed in academic and work experience,
               utilization of colleagues, use of reflection, view of primary
               role, and pattern of delegation of care to support staff.
               Therapists classified as expert had a patient-centered approach
               to care, characterized by collaborative clinical reasoning and
               promotion of patient empowerment. DISCUSSION AND
               CONCLUSION:These findings add to the understanding of factors
               related to patient outcomes and build upon grounded theory for

              usefulness. The aromatase inhibitor anastrozole was compared with
              tamoxifen for 5 years in 9366 postmenopausal women with localised
              breast cancer. After a median follow-up of 68 months, anastrozole
              significantly prolonged disease-free survival (575 events with
              anastrozole vs 651 with tamoxifen, hazard ratio 0.87, 95\% CI
              0.78-0.97, p=0.01) and time-to-recurrence (402 vs 498, 0.79,
              0.70-0.90, p=0.0005), and significantly reduced distant
              metastases (324 vs 375, 0.86, 0.74-0.99, p=0.04) and
              contralateral breast cancers (35 vs 59, 42\% reduction, 12-62,
              p=0.01). Almost all patients have completed their scheduled
              treatment, and fewer withdrawals occurred with anastrozole than
              with tamoxifen. Anastrozole was also associated with fewer
              side-effects than tamoxifen, especially gynaecological problems
              and vascular events, but arthralgia and fractures were increased.
              Anastrozole should be the preferred initial treatment for
              postmenopausal women with localised hormone-receptor-positive
              breast cancer.",

              the effectiveness of Delitto's classification-based treatment
              approach compared with usual physical therapy care in patients
              with subacute or chronic low back pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND
              DATA:No trial has evaluated this approach in patients with
              subacute and chronic low back pain. METHODS:Before randomization,
              all patients were classified by research physical therapists
              according to a modified version of Delitto's classification-based
              system. Randomization was computer-generated, with centralized
              allocation concealment. The statistician and the physical
              therapists were unblinded. Patients and assistants who collected
              follow-up questionnaires were blinded. Follow-up assessments were
              completed at 8, 26, and 52 weeks. The primary analysis was
              performed according to the intention-to-treat principle, using
              multilevel analysis. The main outcomes were global perceived
              effect, disability (Oswestry Disability Index, 0-100), and pain
              intensity (Numerical Rating Scale, 0-10). Secondary outcomes were
              quality of life, fear-avoidance beliefs, and psychosocial status.
              RESULTS.: A total of 156 patients were included
              (classification-based group, n = 74; usual physical therapy
              group, n = 82). There were no statistically significant
              differences between the treatment groups for any of the outcomes
              at any of the follow-up time points. After 8 weeks, patients in
              the classification-based group had greater global perceived
              effect scores; adjusted odds ratio of 1.01 (95\% confidence
              interval [CI], 0.31 to 3.28), and higher adjusted Oswestry
              Disability Index and Numerical Rating Scale scores; mean adjusted
              differences of 0.48 points (95\% CI, -4.59 to 3.63) and 0.49
              points (95\% CI, -1.34 to 0.37) respectively, but all differences
              were statistically nonsignificant. CONCLUSION:The
              classification-based system used in this study was not effective
              for improving physical therapy care outcomes in a population of
              patients with subacute and chronic low back pain.",

              static versus dynamic stretching on peak torque (PT) and
              electromyographic (EMG), and mechanomyographic (MMG) amplitude of
              the biceps femoris muscle (BF) during isometric maximal voluntary
              contractions of the leg flexors at four different knee joint
              angles. Fourteen men ((mean +/- SD) age, 25 +/- 4 years)
              performed two isometric leg flexion maximal voluntary
              contractions at knee joint angles of 41 degrees , 61 degrees , 81
              degrees , and 101 degrees below full leg extension. EMG (muV) and
              MMG (m x s(-2)) signals were recorded from the BF muscle while PT
              values (Nm) were sampled from an isokinetic dynamometer. The
              right hamstrings were stretched with either static (stretching
              time, 9.2 +/- 0.4 minutes) or dynamic (9.1 +/- 0.3 minutes)
              stretching exercises. Four repetitions of three static stretching
              exercises were held for 30 seconds each, whereas four sets of
              three dynamic stretching exercises were performed (12-15
              repetitions) with each set lasting 30 seconds. PT decreased after
              the static stretching at 81 degrees (p = 0.019) and 101 degrees
              (p = 0.001) but not at other angles. PT did not change (p > 0.05)
              after the dynamic stretching. EMG amplitude remained unchanged
              after the static stretching (p > 0.05) but increased after the
              dynamic stretching at 101 degrees (p < 0.001) and 81 degrees (p <
              0.001). MMG amplitude increased in response to the static
              stretching at 101 degrees (p = 0.003), whereas the dynamic
              stretching increased MMG amplitude at all joint angles (p </=
              0.05). These results suggested that the decreases in strength
              after the static stretching may have been the result of
              mechanical rather than neural mechanisms for the BF muscle.
              Overall, an acute bout of dynamic stretching may be less
              detrimental to muscle strength than static stretching for the
              hamstrings.",

              patients with mechanical neck pain receiving thoracic spine
              thrust manipulation would experience superior outcomes compared
              to a group not receiving thrust manipulation. BACKGROUND:Evidence
              has begun to emerge in support of thoracic thrust manipulation as
              an intervention n the management of mechanical neck pain.
              However, to make a strong recommendation for a clinical technique
              it is necessary to have multiple studies with convergent
              findings. METHODS AND MEASURES:Forty-five patients (21 females)
              were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: a control group, which
              received electro-thermal therapy for 5 treatment sessions, and
              the experimental group, which received the same electro/thermal
              therapy program in addition to a thoracic spine thrust
              manipulation once a week for 3 consecutive weeks. Mixed-model
              analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to examine the effects of
              treatment on pain (100-mm visual analogue scale), disability
              (100-point disability scale), and cervical range of motion, with
              group as the between-subjects variable and time as the
              within-subjects variable. The primary analysis was the
              group-by-time interaction for pain. RESULTS:The group-by-time
              interaction effects for the ANOVA models were statistically
              significant for pain, mobility, and disability (P< .05),
              indicating greater improvements in the manipulation group for all
              the outcome measures. Patients receiving thoracic manipulation
              experienced greater improvements in pain at the fifth (final)
              treatment session and at the 2-week and 4-week follow-up periods
              (P< .001), with pain improvement scores in the manipulation group
              of 16.8 mm and 26.6 mm greater than those in the comparison group
              at the 2- and 4-week follow-up periods, respectively. The
              experimental group also experienced significantly greater
              improvements in disability with a between-group difference of 8.8
              points (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 7.5, 10.1; P< .001) at the
              fifth visit and 8.0 points (95\% CI: 5.8, 10.2; P< .001) at the
              2-week follow-up. CONCLUSIONS:The results of our study suggest
              that thoracic spine thrust manipulation results in superior
              clinical benefits that persist beyond the 1-mont follow-up period
              for patients with acute neck pain. Future studies should continue
              to investigate the effects of thoracic spine thrust manipulation,
              as compared to other physical therapy interventions, in a
              population with mechanical neck pain.",

              OBJECTIVES:The purpose of the study was to correlate clinical
              signs and symptoms with pressures generated in the neural foramen
              of patients with cervical radiculopathy. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND
              DATA:The reliability of the clinical signs used to diagnose
              cervical disc herniations has remained controversial. Previous
              studies have shown the active relationship of the cord and nerve
              roots to the various movements of the spine. METHODS:A standard
              anterior approach was made to the cervical spine and the C5-C7
              roots identified. A balloon catheter, attached to a pressure
              transducer and monitor, was inserted in the neural foramen. The
              head was then taken through varying degrees of flexion and
              extension in combination with the arm neutral or abducted.
              RESULTS:Increasing neck extension led to significant pressure
              changes at each root tested. With the movement of the arm from
              the neutral to abducted position, the pressure was significantly
              relieved. The results with neck flexion were variable.
              CONCLUSIONS:The significance of this study is that it offers an
              explanation for the clinical observation of increasing radicular
              symptoms with neck extension and relief of these symptoms with
              the shoulder abduction relief maneuver in the setting of a
              cervical radiculopathy.",

              describe the status of joint manipulation curricula within
              physical therapist professional degree programs in the United
              States. BACKGROUND:Studies have described the evolution of manual
              therapy curricula, including spinal and extremity joint
              mobilization, in physical therapist professional programs, but
              minimal information exists related to joint manipulation
              curricula. METHODS AND MEASURES:Primary faculty members
              responsible for teaching manual therapy curricular content at the
              199 physical therapist professional degree programs located in
              the United States recognized by the Commission on Accreditation
              in Physical Therapy Education were asked to participate in this
              project. The survey documented joint manipulation curricula,
              faculty qualifications, attitudes and experience, and programs'
              future plans for teaching manipulation. RESULTS:Of the 116
              programs responding to our survey, 87 (75\%) currently include
              joint manipulation in their curriculum or plan to soon include
              such content in their curriculum. Of the programs currently
              teaching joint manipulation, 75\% taught it as part of a required
              integrated clinical science course. Faculty teaching manipulation
              content appear to be well qualified and are in clinical practice
              an average of 12 hours per week. The programs currently not
              teaching joint manipulation reported reasons, including belief
              that it was not an entry-level skill (45\%), lack of time (26\%),
              lack of qualified faculty (71\%), and perceived lack of
              scientific evidence regarding efficacy (7\%). CONCLUSIONS:Of the
              responding professional degree programs, 75\% are either
              currently teaching joint manipulation or soon plan to do so. Our
              research may serve as a benchmark for faculty to assess existing
              manual therapy curricula and as a guide for developing curricula
              in new or existing physical therapy programs.",

              many factors. Would e-mail enhance communication and address some
              of the barriers inherent to our medical practices? METHODS:Of our
              study population, 4 physicians offered e-mail communication to
              participating patients and 4 did not. Both patients and
              physicians completed questionnaires regarding satisfaction,
              perceived quality, convenience, and promptness of the
              communication. RESULTS:Patient satisfaction significantly
              increased in the e-mail group compared with the control group in
              the areas of convenience (P < .0001) and the amount of time spent
              contacting their physician (P < .0001). Physician satisfaction in
              the e-mail group increased regarding convenience, amount of time
              spent on messages, and volume of messages. The response time was
              longer with e-mail. When asked if patients should be able to
              e-mail their physicians, most patients in the e-mail group and
              all but 2 of the physicians in the non-e-mail group responded
              ``yes.'' CONCLUSION:E-mail communication was found to be a more
              convenient form of communication. Satisfaction by both patients
              and physicians improved in the e-mail group. The volume of
              messages and the time spent answering messages for the e-mail
              group physicians was not increased. E-mail has the potential to
              improve the doctor-patient relationship as a result of better

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Midfoot sprains in athletes represent a spectrum of
              injuries to the Lisfranc ligament complex, from partial sprains
              with no displacement to complete tears with frank diastasis.
              Treatment of these injuries varies from the treatment of
              high-velocity injuries seen in nonathletes. PURPOSE: We wanted to
              report the outcome of treatment in athletes with Lisfranc
              injuries classified according to our system. STUDY DESIGN:
              Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Weightbearing radiographs
              and bone scintigrams were used to diagnose midfoot sprains in 15
              athletes who were treated surgically or nonoperatively according
              to the following classification: nonoperative management for
              stage I injuries (undisplaced) and anatomic reduction with
              fixation for stage II (diastasis with no arch height loss) and
              stage III (diastasis with arch height loss) injuries. RESULTS: We
              achieved an excellent outcome in 93\% of 15 athletes with midfoot
              sprains at an average follow-up of 27 months (range, 9 to 72).
              CONCLUSIONS: Weightbearing radiographs and bone scintigrams are
              sensitive, reproducible, and relatively inexpensive methods of
              investigation of these injuries. Restoration and maintenance of
              the anatomic alignment of the Lisfranc joint is the key to
              appropriate treatment of injury to the midfoot.",

               environments is complicated by the lack of nationally available
               benchmarking data. Objective:The objective of this study was to
               compare a physical therapist academic environment to another
               health care profession (medicine) academic environment using the
               Association of American Medical Colleges Graduation
               Questionnaire (GQ) survey. Design:The design consisted of
               longitudinal benchmarking. Methods:Between 2009 and 2017, the GQ
               was administered to graduates of a physical therapist education
               program (Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation
               Science, Carver College of Medicine, The University of Iowa
               [PTRS]). Their ratings of the educational environment were
               compared to nationwide data for a peer health care profession
               (medicine) educational environment. Benchmarking to the GQ
               capitalizes on a large, psychometrically validated database of
               academic domains that may be broadly applicable to health care
               education. The GQ captures critical information about the
               student experience (eg, faculty professionalism, burnout,
               student mistreatment) that can be used to characterize the
               educational environment. This study hypothesized that the
               ratings provided by 9 consecutive cohorts of PTRS students (n =
               316) would reveal educational environment differences from
               academic medical education. Results:PTRS students reported
               significantly higher ratings of the educational emotional
               climate and student-faculty interactions than medical students.
               PTRS and medical students did not differ on ratings of empathy
               and tolerance for ambiguity. PTRS students reported
               significantly lower ratings of burnout than medical students.
               PTRS students descriptively reported observing greater faculty
               professionalism and experiencing less mistreatment than medical
               students. Limitations:The generalizability of these findings to
               other physical therapist education environments has not been
               established. Conclusions:Selected elements of the GQ survey
               revealed differences in the educational environments experienced
               by physical therapist students and medical students. All
               physical therapist academic programs should adopt a universal
               method to benchmark the educational environment to understand
               the student experience.",

              study. OBJECTIVES:To investigate the spinopelvic alignment in
              patients with osteoarthosis of the hip (HOA) and those with low
              back pain (LBP) and to determine the characteristics and
              differences in both groups. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:Hip-spine
              syndrome, first described by Offierski and MacNab, is quite an
              important pathology when treating patients with pain in their low
              back and lower extremities. However, despite it being a
              well-known entity, few papers have adequately investigated and
              assessed the spinopelvic alignment in patients with hip-spine
              syndrome. METHODS:Sagittal and coronal spinopelvic alignments
              were investigated in 150 patients with HOA and 150 with LBP using
              radiographs of the whole spine in both anteroposterior and
              lateral views. Parameters measured in this study were lumbar
              lordosis (LL), sacral slope (SS), the shift of the sagittal C7
              plumb line, pelvic incidence (PI), and pelvic tilt (PT) on the
              lateral radiographs. On the anteroposterior (AP) films, lumbar
              scoliosis, pelvic obliquity, leg length discrepancy, the shift of
              the coronal C7 plumb line, and Sharp angle were measured. These
              parameters were compared between the two groups. In patients with
              HOA, the relationships between Sharp angle and other parameters
              were also analyzed to clarify the possible influence of sagittal
              and coronal spinopelvic alignments on HOA without acetabular
              dysplasia. RESULTS:LL, SS, PI, and PO were found to be less in
              patients with LBP compared with those with HOA, and there was no
              significant difference in LS between the two groups. PI was
              significantly greater in HOA patients and strongly correlated to
              PT, SS, and LL (i.e., as the PI increased so did the PT, SS, and
              LL). Sharp angles were also significantly greater in HOA patients
              and strongly correlated to age, LL and SS (i.e., as Sharp angles
              increased so did LL and SS); however, age decreased in the hip
              patients. CONCLUSIONS:These findings suggest that higher PI in
              the younger individual may contribute to the development of HOA
              in later life without both lumbar kyphosis and acetabular
              dysplasia because of the anterior uncovering of the acetabulum.
              More investigation will be expected to analyze the spinopelvic
              alignment in patients with hip spine syndrome.",

              information regarding adverse cerebrovascular events in the
              context of manual therapy assessment and management of the
              cervical spine. Its aim is to facilitate clinical decision making
              during diagnosis and treatment of patients presenting to the
              therapist with cervicocranial pain. Rather than focusing on a
              traditional view of premanipulative testing as the cornerstone
              for decision making, we present information concerning the
              clinical presentation of specific vascular conditions.
              Additionally, we discuss the assessment and management of
              musculoskeletal pain in the presence of risk factors for
              cerebrovascular accident. It is proposed that vascular ``red
              flag'' presentations mimic neuromusculoskeletal cervicocranial
              syndromes. Invariably, the 2 conditions coexist. This reasoning
              presupposes that some patients who have poor clinical outcomes,
              or a serious adverse response to treatment, may be those who
              actually present with undiagnosed vascular pathology. We use 2
              case reports to demonstrate how incorporating vascular knowledge
              into clinical reasoning processes may influence clinical decision
              making. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 5.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND:Virtual reality (VR) is an interactive technology
               that allows customized treatment and may help in delivering
               effective person-centered rehabilitation. PURPOSE:The purpose of
               this review was to systematically review and critically appraise
               the controlled clinical trials that investigated VR
               effectiveness in orthopedic rehabilitation. DATA SOURCES:Pubmed,
               CINAHL, Embase, PEDro, REHABDATA, and Sage publications were
               searched up to September 2018. In addition, manual searching and
               snowballing using Scopus and Web of Science were done. STUDY
               SELECTION:Two reviewers screened studies for eligibility first
               by title and abstract and then full text. DATA
               EXTRACTION:Articles were categorized into general or
               region-specific (upper limbs, lower limbs, and spine) orthopedic
               disorders. Study quality was assessed using the Evaluation
               Guidelines for Rating the Quality of an Intervention Study
               scoring. Meta-analysis quantified VR effectiveness, compared
               with no treatment, in back pain. DATA SYNTHESIS:Nineteen studies
               were included in the quality assessment. The majority of the
               studies were of moderate quality. Fourteen studies showed that
               VR did not differ compared with exercises. Compared with the
               no-treatment control, 5 studies favored VR and 3 other studies
               showed no differences. For low back pain, the meta-analysis
               revealed no significant difference between VR and no-treatment
               control (n = 116; standardized mean difference = -0.21; 95\%
               confidence interval = -0.58 to 0.15). LIMITATIONS:Limitations
               included heterogeneity in interventions and the outcome measures
               of reviewed studies. Only articles in English were included.
               CONCLUSION:The evidence of VR effectiveness is promising in
               chronic neck pain and shoulder impingement syndrome. VR and
               exercises have similar effects in rheumatoid arthritis, knee
               arthritis, ankle instability, and post-anterior cruciate
               reconstruction. For fibromyalgia and back pain, as well as after
               knee arthroplasty, the evidence of VR effectiveness compared
               with exercise is absent or inconclusive.",

               targeting balance. OBJECTIVE:The aim was to investigate the
               effect of Senior Dance on balance, mobility, and cognitive
               function compared with a control intervention. DESIGN:The study
               was a randomized controlled trial. SETTING/PATIENTS:Eighty-two
               community-dwelling older people aged 60 years or over and
               cognitively intact were recruited in Brazil.
               INTERVENTION:Participants were randomly allocated to 2 groups:
               Dance plus education (intervention group) and education alone
               (control group). The Senior Dance program consisted of 12 weeks
               of twice-weekly group-based dance classes. Participants in both
               groups attended a single 1-hour educational session on
               prevention of falls. MEASUREMENTS:The primary outcome was
               single-leg stance with eyes closed. Secondary outcomes were
               timed sit-to-stand test, standing balance test, timed 4-m walk,
               and cognitive function tests, for example, Trail Making Test and
               Montreal Cognitive Assessment. RESULTS:Of the 82 participants
               randomized, 71 (87\%) completed the 12-week follow-up.
               Single-leg stance with eyes closed (primary outcome) improved in
               the Senior Dance group (mean difference [MD] = 2.3 seconds, 95\%
               confidence interval [CI] = 1.1 to 3.6) compared with the control
               group at follow-up. Senior Dance group performed better in the
               standing balance tests (MD = 3.7 seconds, 95\% CI = 0.6 to 6.8)
               and were faster in the sit-to-stand test (MD = - 3.1 seconds,
               95\% CI = -4.8 to -1.4) and 4-m walk test (MD = -0.6 seconds,
               95\% CI = -1.0 to -0.1). There were no significant between-group
               differences for cognitive function tests.
               LIMITATIONS:Participants and therapists were not blinded.

               lumbar traction protocol. DESIGN:Prospective, longitudinal, case
               series. SETTING:Suburban, chiropractic practice. PARTICIPANTS:A
               total of 296 subjects with low back pain (LBP) and evidence of a
               degenerative and/or herniated intervertebral disk at 1 or more
               levels of the lumbar spine. We excluded patients involved in
               litigation and those receiving workers' compensation.
               INTERVENTION:An 8-week course of prone lumbar traction, using
               the vertebral axial decompression (VAX-D) system, consisting of
               five 30-minute sessions a week for 4 weeks, followed by one
               30-minute session a week for 4 additional weeks. MAIN OUTCOME
               MEASURES:The numeric pain rating scale and the Roland-Morris
               Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) were completed at
               preintervention, discharge (within 2 weeks of the last visit),
               and at 30 days and 180 days after discharge. Intention-to-treat
               strategies were used to account for those subjects lost to
               follow-up. RESULTS:A total of 250 (84.4\%) subjects completed
               the treatment protocol. On the 30-day follow-up, 247 (83.4\%)
               subjects were available; on the 180-day follow-up, data were
               available for 241 (81.4\%) subjects. We noted significant
               improvements for all postintervention outcome scores when
               compared with preintervention scores (P<.01).
               CONCLUSIONS:Traction applied in the prone position using the
               VAX-D for 8 weeks was associated with improvements in pain
               intensity and RMDQ scores at discharge, and at 30 and 180 days
               after discharge in a sample of patients with activity-limiting
               LBP. Causal relationships between these outcomes and the

               examination or physical therapy interventions received could
               predict clinical outcomes for people with cervical
               radiculopathy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS:A total of 96 consecutive
               patients referred for physical therapy for cervical
               radiculopathy were the sources of data for this study. All
               subjects underwent a standardized examination and completed the
               Neck Disability Index (NDI), the Patient-Specific Functional
               Scale (PSFS), and the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) at
               baseline and at discharge. The subjects were treated according
               to the discretion of the individual therapists. At the time of
               discharge, the subjects completed the Global Rating of Change as
               well. Subjects surpassing the minimal clinically important
               change for all 4 outcome tools were categorized as achieving
               short-term success. Individual variables from the examination
               and interventions provided were tested for univariate
               relationships with outcomes. Variables with a significance level
               of less than .10 were retained as potential predictor variables
               and were entered into a stepwise logistic regression model to
               determine the most accurate set of variables for predicting
               outcomes. RESULTS:The pretest probability for the likelihood of
               short-term (28-day follow-up) success was 53\%. A 4-variable
               model optimally identified subjects who were most likely to
               achieve success with physical therapy interventions (age of <54
               years; dominant arm is not affected; looking down does not
               worsen symptoms; and multimodal treatment including manual
               therapy, cervical traction, and deep neck flexor muscle
               strengthening for at least 50\% of visits). When 3 of these 4
               variables were present, the positive likelihood ratio (+LR) was
               5.2 (95\% confidence interval [CI]=2.4, 11.3), and the posttest
               probability of success was 85\%. When all 4 variables were
               present, the +LR was 8.3 (95\% CI=1.9, 63.9), and the posttest
               probability of success was 90\%. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION:These
               results suggest that a subset of predictor variables can
               accurately identify which people with cervical radiculopathy are
               likely to experience short-term successful outcomes. The study
               design did not allow for the identification of a
               cause-and-effect relationship, but it appears that intermittent
               cervical traction, manual therapy, and deep neck flexor muscle
               strengthening may be beneficial in the management of cervical
               radiculopathy. Future research is needed to substantiate these

              activities are related to pelvic motion and low back muscle
              activity during prone hip extension. Sixteen healthy participants
              performed prone hip extension from 30° of hip flexion to 10° of
              hip extension. Surface electromyography (of the gluteus maximus,
              semitendinosus, rectus femoris, tensor fasciae latae, multifidus,
              and erector spinae) and pelvic kinematic measurements were

              flexor (tensor fasciae latae) relative to that of hip extensors
              (gluteus maximus and semitendinosus) was significantly associated

              scapular motor control retraining for young individuals with
              shoulder impingement signs. METHOD:Sixteen adults with shoulder
              impingement signs (mean age 22 $\pm$ 1.6 years) underwent the
              intervention and 16 healthy participants (24.8 $\pm$ 3.1years)
              provided reference data. Shoulder function and pain were assessed
              using the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) and other
              questionnaires. Electromyography (EMG) and 3-dimensional motion
              analysis was used to record muscle activation and kinematic data
              during arm elevation to 90° and lowering in 3 planes. Patients
              were assessed pre and post a 10-week motor control based
              intervention, utilizing scapular orientation retraining.
              RESULTS:Pre-intervention, patients reported pain and reduced
              function compared to the healthy participants (SPADI in patients
              20 $\pm$ 9.2; healthy 0 $\pm$ 0). Post-intervention, the SPADI
              scores reduced significantly (P < .001) by a mean of 10 points
              ($\pm$4). EMG showed delayed onset and early termination of
              serratus anterior and lower trapezius muscle activity
              pre-intervention, which improved significantly post-intervention
              (P < .05). Pre-intervention, patients exhibited on average
              4.6-7.4° less posterior tilt, which was significantly lower in 2
              arm elevation planes (P < .05) than healthy participants.
              Post-intervention, upward rotation and posterior tilt increased
              significantly (P < .05) during 2 arm movements, approaching the
              healthy values. CONCLUSION:A 10-week motor control intervention
              for shoulder impingement increased function and reduced pain.
              Recovery mechanisms were indicated by changes in muscle
              recruitment and scapular kinematics. The efficacy of the

              to another. METHODS:This randomized controlled trial aimed to
              investigate the efficacy of a behavioural approach to management,
              classification-based cognitive functional therapy, compared with
              traditional manual therapy and exercise. Linear mixed models were

              Primary outcomes at 12-month follow-up were Oswestry Disability
              Index and pain intensity, measured with numeric rating scale.
              Inclusion criteria were as follows: age between 18 and 65 years,
              diagnosed with non-specific chronic low back pain for >3 months,
              localized pain from T12 to gluteal folds, provoked with postures,

              outcomes to the manual therapy and exercise group, both
              statistically (p < 0.001) and clinically. For Oswestry Disability
              Index, the classification-based cognitive functional therapy

               function is not clear. Objective:The objective was to determine
               if differences exist in trunk muscle function and self-reported
               pain and low back dysfunction between women with and without DRA
               at 12 to 14 months postpartum and if differences that emerge
               from the data are associated with the magnitude of the
               interrectus distance (IRD). Design:This study was a prospective,
               observational, case-control study. Methods:Women with (IRD
               $\geq$ 2.2 cm; n = 18) and without DRA (IRD < 2.2 cm; n = 22)
               participated. Maximal trunk flexion, extension, and rotation
               torque-generating capacity (Newton-meters), the Sit-Up test (0
               to 3 points), and the Sitting-Rising Test (0 to 10 points), and
               trunk flexion, extension, and lateral flexion endurance
               (seconds) were measured. Pain and disability were assessed using
               numerical pain rating scales (0 to 100) and the Roland Morris
               Low Back Pain Questionnaire (0 to 24 points). Women were
               compared using independent t tests and Mann-Whitney U Tests.
               Pearson product-moment and Spearman rank correlation
               coefficients were used to determine associations; a = .05 was
               used for all tests. Results:Women with DRA demonstrated
               significantly lower trunk muscle rotation torque and scored
               lower on the sit-up test than those without DRA. IRD was
               negatively correlated with both trunk rotation torque (rho =
               -0.367) and sit-up test score (rho = -0.514). Limitations:The
               results of this study should not be generalized to women who
               present with moderate-to-severe IRDs or to multiparous women.
               Conclusion:The presence of DRA in primiparous women at 1 year

               100,000, but reliable epidemiologic data for vertebral artery
               dissection (VAD) are not available. OBJECTIVE:To determine the
               incidence rate of cervical artery dissection (CAD) in a defined
               population. METHODS:With IRB approval, we used the medical
               record linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project to
               identify all patients diagnosed with spontaneous ICAD and VAD
               for the period of 1987-2003 in Olmsted County, MN. RESULTS:Of 48
               patients with CAD, there were 32 patients with ICAD and 18
               patients with VAD. In Olmsted County, the average annual
               incidence rate for ICAD was 1.72 per 100,000 population (95\%
               CI, 1.13 to 2.32) and for VAD 0.97 per 100,000 population (95\%
               CI, 0.52 to 1.4). The average annual incidence rate for CAD was
               2.6 per 100,000 population (95\% CI, 1.86 to 3.33). The most
               frequently encountered symptoms in CAD were head or neck pain
               (80\%), cerebral ischemia (TIA or infarct) (56\%), and Horner
               syndrome (25\%). Good outcome (defined as modified Rankin score
               of 0 to 2) was seen in 92\% of patients. No recurrence of
               dissection was observed during a mean 7.8 years of follow-up.
               CONCLUSIONS:Internal carotid artery dissection was detected
               approximately twice as frequently as vertebral artery dissection
               in the overall study, but in the latter half of the study
               period, vertebral artery and internal carotid artery dissection

  author    = "Frese, Ethel M and Richter, Randy R and Burlis, Tamara V",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:The Guide to Physical Therapist Practice
               (Guide) recommends that heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP)
               measurement be included in the examination of new patients. The
               purpose of this study was to survey physical therapy clinical
               instructors to determine the frequency of HR and BP measurement
               in new patients and in patients already on the physical
               therapists' caseload. The use of information obtained from HR
               and BP measures in decision making for patient care and the
               effects of practice setting and academic preparation on the
               measurement and use of HR and BP also were examined. SUBJECTS
               AND METHODS:A sample of 597 subjects was selected from a list of
               2,663 clinical instructors at the clinical education sites of
               the 2 participating universities. Clinical instructors from a
               variety of practice settings were surveyed. A 26-item survey
               questionnaire was mailed to the clinical instructors.
               RESULTS:Usable survey questionnaires were received from 387
               respondents (64.8\%); 43.4\% reported working in an outpatient
               facility. The majority of the respondents strongly agreed or
               agreed (59.5\%) that measurement of HR and BP should be included
               in physical therapy screening. When asked if routinely measuring
               HR and BP during clinical practice is essential, opinions were
               nearly split (strongly agree or agree=45.0\%, strongly disagree
               or disagree=43.7\%, no opinion=11.3\%). More than one third
               (38.0\%) of the respondents reported never measuring HR in the
               week before the survey as part of their examination of new
               patients. A slightly larger percentage (43.0\%) reported never
               measuring BP of new patients in the week before the survey.
               Conversely, 6.0\% and 4.4\% of the respondents reported always
               measuring HR and BP, respectively, of new patients in the week
               before the survey. When given a list of reasons why HR and BP
               were not routinely measured in their clinical practice,
               respondents most frequently chose ``not important for my patient
               population'' (52.3\%). Relationships were found between practice
               setting and frequency of HR and BP measurement in new patients.
               DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION:Practices related to HR and BP
               measurement reported by this sample of clinical instructors do
               not meet the recommendations for physical therapy care described
               in the Guide.",

               condition associated with degeneration of the spine with aging.
               OBJECTIVES:To evaluate the effectiveness of different types of
               surgery compared with different types of non-surgical
               interventions in adults with symptomatic LSS. Primary outcomes
               included quality of life, disability, function and pain. Also,
               to consider complication rates and side effects, and to evaluate
               short-, intermediate- and long-term outcomes (six months, six
               months to two years, five years or longer). SEARCH METHODS:We
               searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
               (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, five other databases and two trials
               registries up to February 2015. We also screened reference lists
               and conference proceedings related to treatment of the spine.
               SELECTION CRITERIA:Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing
               surgical versus non-operative treatments in participants with
               lumbar spinal stenosis confirmed by clinical and imaging
               findings. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:For data collection and
               analysis, we followed methods guidelines of the Cochrane Back
               and Neck Review Group (Furlan 2009) and those provided in the
               Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions
               (Higgins 2011). MAIN RESULTS:From the 12,966 citations screened,
               we assessed 26 full-text articles and included five RCTs (643
               participants).Low-quality evidence from the meta-analysis
               performed on two trials using the Oswestry Disability Index
               (pain-related disability) to compare direct decompression with
               or without fusion versus multi-modal non-operative care showed
               no significant differences at six months (mean difference (MD)
               -3.66, 95\% confidence interval (CI) -10.12 to 2.80) and at one
               year (MD -6.18, 95\% CI -15.03 to 2.66). At 24 months,
               significant differences favoured decompression (MD -4.43, 95\%
               CI -7.91 to -0.96). Low-quality evidence from one small study
               revealed no difference in pain outcomes between decompression
               and usual conservative care (bracing and exercise) at three
               months (risk ratio (RR) 1.38, 95\% CI 0.22 to 8.59), four years
               (RR 7.50, 95\% CI 1.00 to 56.48) and 10 years (RR 4.09, 95\% CI
               0.95 to 17.58).Low-quality evidence from one small study
               suggested no differences at six weeks in the Oswestry Disability
               Index for patients treated with minimally invasive mild
               decompression versus those treated with epidural steroid
               injections (MD 5.70, 95\% CI 0.57 to 10.83; 38 participants).
               Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) results were better for
               epidural injection at six weeks (MD -0.60, 95\% CI -0.92 to
               -0.28), and visual analogue scale (VAS) improvements were better
               in the mild decompression group (MD 2.40, 95\% CI 1.92 to 2.88).
               At 12 weeks, many cross-overs prevented further
               analysis.Low-quality evidence from a single study including 191
               participants favoured the interspinous spacer versus usual
               conservative treatment at six weeks, six months and one year for
               symptom severity and physical function.All remaining studies
               reported complications associated with surgery and conservative
               side effects of treatment: Two studies reported no major
               complications in the surgical group, and the other study
               reported complications in 10\% and 24\% of participants,
               including spinous process fracture, coronary ischaemia,
               respiratory distress, haematoma, stroke, risk of reoperation and
               death due to pulmonary oedema. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:We have very
               little confidence to conclude whether surgical treatment or a
               conservative approach is better for lumbar spinal stenosis, and
               we can provide no new recommendations to guide clinical
               practice. However, it should be noted that the rate of side
               effects ranged from 10\% to 24\% in surgical cases, and no side
               effects were reported for any conservative treatment. No clear
               benefits were observed with surgery versus non-surgical
               treatment. These findings suggest that clinicians should be very
               careful in informing patients about possible treatment options,
               especially given that conservative treatment options have
               resulted in no reported side effects. High-quality research is
               needed to compare surgical versus conservative care for
               individuals with lumbar spinal stenosis.",

               important marker of functional recovery following fracture.
               OBJECTIVE:The objectives of this study were to measure sedentary
               behavior and physical activity 2 weeks and 6 months following
               fracture and to determine associated demographic and injury
               factors. DESIGN:This was an observational study. METHODS:Two
               weeks and 6 months following fracture, 83 adults who were 18 to
               69 years old and had upper limb (UL) or lower limb (LL)
               fractures wore an accelerometer and an inclinometer for 10 days.
               We calculated sitting time, steps, moderate-intensity physical
               activity (MPA), and vigorous-intensity physical activity and
               conducted linear mixed-effects multivariable regression analyses
               to determine factors associated with temporal changes in
               activity. RESULTS:At 6 months versus 2 weeks after fracture,
               participants sat less, took more steps, and engaged in more MPA.
               Participants with LL fractures sat 2 hours more, took 66\% fewer
               steps, and engaged in 77\% less MPA than participants with UL
               fractures. Greater reductions in sitting time were observed for
               participants in the youngest age group and with LL fractures,
               participants with high preinjury activity, and participants who
               were overweight or obese. For steps, greater improvement was
               observed for participants in the youngest and middle-aged groups
               and those with LL fractures. For MPA, greater improvement was
               observed for middle-aged participants and those with LL
               fractures. LIMITATIONS:Although this study was sufficiently
               powered for the analysis of major categories, a convenience
               sample that may not be representative of all people with
               musculoskeletal trauma was used. CONCLUSIONS:Working-age adults
               with LL fractures had lower levels of physical activity 6 months
               after fracture than those with UL fractures. Older adults showed
               less improvement over time, suggesting that they are an
               important target group for interventions aimed at regaining
               preinjury activity levels.",

               clinical tests with ambulatory gait speed with regard to several
               health outcomes. OBJECTIVE:The objective of this study was to
               examine the associations of clinical gait speed, measured by the
               2.44-m walk test and the ambulatory gait speed with several
               physical, mental, and cognitive health outcomes in older adults.
               DESIGN:A cross-sectional design was used. METHODS:The study
               population comprised 432 high-functioning, community-dwelling
               older adults (287 women) aged between 65 and 92 years. Clinical
               and ambulatory gait speeds were measured using the 2.44-m walk
               test and a portable gait analysis device, respectively. Multiple
               linear regressions were used to examine the association of
               clinical and ambulatory gait speeds with several health outcomes
               (body mass index, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic
               blood pressure, chronic conditions, self-rated health,
               exhaustion, upper- and lower-body strength, physical and mental
               health status, cognitive status, and self-rated cognitive
               status). RESULTS:The results showed that the average gait speed
               for clinical and ambulatory measures cannot be directly
               compared. Clinical gait speed was associated with 7 health
               outcomes, and the ambulatory gait speed was associated with 6
               health outcomes. The significant associations between measures
               of gait speed and the health outcomes converged in 5 of the 13
               health outcomes studied; however, the strength of associations
               was singly different between measures. LIMITATIONS:The short
               monitoring time, the inability to distinguish between the
               ambulatory gait speed inside the home and outdoor gait speed,
               and the under-representative sample are limitations of the
               study. CONCLUSION:The results indicated differences in the
               number and strength of associations between clinical and
               ambulatory gait speed. Both measures have construct validity
               because they have been associated with physical and health
               outcomes; however, they may have different predictive validity.
               Further research should be conducted to compare their predictive
               validity in longitudinal designs.",

               research. SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS:The reliability of clinicians'
               ratings is an important consideration in areas such as diagnosis
               and the interpretation of examination findings. Often, these
               ratings lie on a nominal or an ordinal scale. For such data, the
               kappa coefficient is an appropriate measure of reliability.
               Kappa is defined, in both weighted and unweighted forms, and its
               use is illustrated with examples from musculoskeletal research.
               Factors that can influence the magnitude of kappa (prevalence,
               bias, and non-independent ratings) are discussed, and ways of
               evaluating the magnitude of an obtained kappa are considered.
               The issue of statistical testing of kappa is considered,
               including the use of confidence intervals, and appropriate
               sample sizes for reliability studies using kappa are tabulated.
               CONCLUSIONS:The article concludes with recommendations for the
               use and interpretation of kappa.",

              Research Trial. OBJECTIVE:To compare baseline characteristics and
              surgical and nonoperative outcomes between degenerative
              spondylolisthesis (DS) and spinal stenosis (SPS) patients.
              SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:DS and SPS patients are often combined
              in clinical studies despite differences in underlying pathology
              and treatment. METHODS:The DS cohort included 601 patients (369
              [61\%] underwent surgery), and the SPS cohort included 634
              patients (394 [62\%] underwent surgery). Baseline characteristics
              were compared between the 2 groups. Changes from baseline for
              surgical and nonoperative outcomes were compared at 1 and 2 years
              using longitudinal regression models. Primary outcome measures
              included the SF-36 bodily pain and physical function scores and
              the Oswestry Disability Index. RESULTS:The DS patients included
              more females (69\% vs. 39\%, P < 0.001), were older (66.1 year
              vs. 64.6 years, P = 0.021), and were less likely to have
              multilevel stenosis (35\% vs. 61\%, P < 0.001) compared with the
              SPS patients. There were no significant baseline differences on
              any of the main outcome measures. DS patients undergoing surgery
              were much more likely to be fused than SPS patients (94\% vs.
              11\%, P < 0.001) and improved more with surgery than SPS patients
              on all primary outcome measures (DS vs. SPS): physical function
              (+30.4 vs. +25.3, P = 0.004 at 1 year; + 28.3 vs. +21.4, P <
              0.001 at 2 years), bodily pain (+32.3 vs. +27.5, P = 0.006 at 1
              year; +31.1 vs. +26.1, P = 0.003 at 2 years), and Oswestry
              Disability Index (-25.9 vs. -21.0, P < 0.001 at 1 year; -24.7 vs.
              -20.2, P < 0.001 at 2 years). Patients treated nonoperatively
              improved less than those treated surgically, and there were no
              significant differences in nonoperative outcomes between the 2
              cohorts. CONCLUSION:Overall, DS and SPS patients had similar
              baseline characteristics. However, DS patients improved more with
              surgery than SPS patients. Future studies should probably not
              combine these heterogeneous patient populations.",

  abstract  = "Background:A recent survey found that 84\% of physical
               therapist, physical therapist assistant, and student respondents
               experienced inappropriate patient sexual behavior (IPSB) over
               their careers and 47\% over the prior 12 months. Prevalence data
               justify consideration of how to address IPSB. Objective:The
               objective was to determine how physical therapist clinicians
               (used here to mean physical therapists, physical therapist
               assistants, and students) address IPSB and examine strategy
               impact. Design:The design was observational and cross-sectional.
               Methods:Several sections of the American Physical Therapy
               Association and selected education programs fielded the
               electronic survey. Respondents reported on the frequency and
               effect of IPSB response strategy. Response-strategy impact was
               tested for statistical significance. Open-ended comments were
               analyzed using qualitative methods. Results:Of 1027 respondents,
               396 had experienced IPSB over the prior 12 months; 391 provided
               data on the frequency and effect of response strategies used.
               Common informal responses included distraction, ignoring IPSB,
               and altering treatment to avoid physical contact or being alone.
               Common formal responses included reporting the behavior within
               the facility and documenting the behavior. Successful strategies
               included distraction, avoidance, direct confrontation,
               behavioral contracts, transfer of care, and chaperone use.
               Experienced clinicians were more likely to be direct, whereas
               novice clinicians were more likely to engage in unsuccessful
               actions of ignoring and joking. Limitations:Limitations included
               self-report, clinician memory, and convenience sampling.
               Conclusions:The first findings in 20 years on physical
               therapist, physical therapist assistant, and student response to
               IPSB provide direction for the profession. Results indicate a
               need for clear workplace policies coupled with training for
               managers and supervisors to support clinicians in resolving
               IPSB. Policies on using behavioral contracts, chaperones, and
               transfer of care could empower staff to consider these
               successful options. Professional education and training for all
               physical therapy professionals on assertive communication and
               redirection strategies with IPSB appears warranted.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The assessment of outcomes from the patient's
               perspective becomes more recognized in health care. Also in
               patients with chronic ankle instability, the degree of present
               impairments, disabilities and participation problems should be
               documented from the perspective of the patient. The decision
               about which patient-assessed instrument is most appropriate for
               clinical practice should be based upon systematic reviews. Only
               rating scales constructed for patients with acute ligament
               injuries were systematically reviewed in the past. The aim of
               this study was to review systematically the clinimetric
               qualities of patient-assessed instruments designed for patients
               with chronic ankle instability. METHODS: A computerized
               literature search of Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Web of Science,
               Sport Discus and the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register was
               performed to identify eligible instruments. Two reviewers
               independently evaluated the clinimetric qualities of the
               selected instruments using a criteria list. The inter-observer
               reliability of both the selection procedure and the clinimetric
               evaluation was calculated using modified kappa coefficients.
               RESULTS: The inter-observer reliability of the selection
               procedure was excellent (k = .86). Four instruments met the
               eligibility criteria: the Ankle Joint Functional Assessment Tool
               (AJFAT), the Functional Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS), the Foot and
               Ankle Disability Index (FADI) and the Functional Ankle Ability
               Measure (FAAM). The inter-observer reliability of the quality
               assessment was substantial to excellent (k between .64 and .88).
               Test-retest reliability was demonstrated for the FAOS, the FADI
               and the FAAM but not for the AJFAT. The FAOS and the FAAM met
               the criteria for content validity and construct validity. For
               none of the studied instruments, the internal consistency was
               sufficiently demonstrated. The presence of floor- and ceiling
               effects was assessed for the FAOS but ceiling effects were
               present for all subscales. Responsiveness was demonstrated for
               the AJFAT, FADI and the FAAM. Only for the FAAM, a minimal
               clinical important difference (MCID) was presented. CONCLUSION:
               The FADI and the FAAM can be considered as the most appropriate,
               patient-assessed tools to quantify functional disabilities in
               patients with chronic ankle instability. The clinimetric
               qualities of the FAAM need to be further demonstrated in a
               specific population of patients with chronic ankle instability.",

              patients with low back pain in an attempt to reduce inappropriate
              variations and improve the cost-effectiveness of care. Guideline
              implementation has received more research attention than the
              impact of adherence to guideline recommendations on outcomes and
              costs of care. OBJECTIVE:Examine the association between
              adherence to the guideline recommendation to use active versus
              passive treatments with clinical outcomes and costs for patients
              with acute low back pain receiving physical therapy. RESEARCH
              DESIGN:Retrospective review of patients with acute low back pain
              receiving physical therapy in 2004-2005. Adherence to the
              recommendation for active treatment was determined from billing
              records. Clinical and financial outcomes were compared between
              patients receiving adherent or nonadherent care. SUBJECTS:A total
              of 1190 patients age 18-60 years old with low back pain of less
              than 90 days duration in 10 clinics in 1 geographic region.
              MEASURES:Clinical outcomes included the numeric pain rating and
              Oswestry disability questionnaire taken initially and at the
              completion of treatment. Financial outcomes included the number
              of sessions and charges for physical therapy care.
              RESULTS:Adherence rate was 40.4\%. Adherence was greater for
              patients receiving workers' compensation (P < 0.05). Patients
              receiving adherent care had fewer visits and lower charges (P <
              0.05), and showed more improvement in disability [adjusted mean
              difference for percentage improvement 25.8\%, 95\% confidence
              interval (CI): 21.3-30.4, P < 0.001] and pain (adjusted mean
              difference for percentage improvement 22.4\%, 95\% CI: 17.5-27.3,
              P < 0.001). Patients receiving adherent care were more likely to
              have a successful physical therapy outcome (64.7\% vs. 36.5\%, P
              < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS:Adherence to the guideline recommendation

               primary care physician for LBP who met all eligibility criteria
               including a positive slump test but who had a negative
               straight-leg-raise test (SLR) agreed to participate in the
               study. All patients completed several self-report measures
               including a body diagram, numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), and
               the modified Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Patients were
               randomized to receive lumbar spine mobilization and exercise (n
               = 14) or lumbar spine mobilization, exercise, and slump
               stretching (n = 16). All patients were treated in physical
               therapy twice weekly for 3 weeks for a total of 6 visits. Upon
               discharge, outcome measures were re-assessed. Independent
               t-tests were used to assess differences between groups at
               baseline and discharge. No baseline differences existed between
               the groups (P > .05). At discharge, patients who received slump
               stretching demonstrated significantly greater improvements in
               disability (9.7 points on the ODI, P < .001), pain (.93 points

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE:To make recommendations for the long-term use of
               nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in primary care
               practice, particularly for patients at high risk for
               NSAID-induced complications. OPTIONS:The use of misoprostol to
               prevent gastrointestinal ulceration and other unwanted NSAIDs
               effects was considered. The role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
               versus COX-1 inhibiting agents was also examined.
               OUTCOMES:Reduction of complications associated with long-term
               use of NSAIDs. EVIDENCE:Evidence was gathered in late 1995 from
               published research studies and reviews. Position papers were
               prepared by faculty and advisory board members and discussed at
               the Canadian NSAID Consensus Symposium in Cambridge, Ont., Jan.
               26 and 27, 1996. VALUES:Recommendations were based on
               randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials (level I
               evidence) and case-control studies (level II evidence) involving
               NSAID use when such evidence was available. When the scientific
               literature was incomplete or inconsistent in a particular area,
               recommendations reflect the consensus of the participants at the
               symposium (level III evidence). Physicians were recruited from
               across Canada for their expertise in rheumatology,
               gastroenterology, epidemiology, gerontology, family practice,
               and clinical and basic scientific research. BENEFITS, HARMS AND
               COSTS:Although a reduction in complications due to inappropriate
               NSAID use should reduce costs of additional investigations,
               admissions to hospital and time lost from work, definitive cost
               analysis studies are not yet available.
               RECOMMENDATIONS:Currently, no NSAID is available that lacks
               potential for serious toxicity; therefore, long-term use of
               NSAIDs should be avoided whenever possible, particularly in
               high-risk patients (e.g., those who are elderly, suffer from
               hypertension, congestive heart failure, renal or hepatic
               impairment or volume depletion, take certain concomitant
               medications or have a history of peptic ulcer disease) (level I
               evidence). If NSAIDs are to be used in patients with gastric or
               nephrotoxic risk factors, the lowest effective dose of NSAID
               should be used (level III evidence); NSAIDs that are weak COX-1
               inhibitors may be preferred (level II evidence). In addition,
               concomitant administration of misoprostol is recommended in
               patients at increased risk for upper gastrointestinal
               complications (level I evidence). However, the clinical
               judgement of the practising clinician must always be part of any
               therapeutic decision. VALIDATION:These recommendations are based
               on the consensus of Canadian experts in rheumatology,
               gastroenterology and epidemiology, and have been subjected to
               external peer review.",

  abstract = "A double-blind trial was carried out to determine the sensitivity
              and specificity of three commonly used pain provocation tests for
              sacroiliac joint dysfunction. The trial involved 40 patients, all
              of whom reported pain when they were subjected to each of the
              three tests. Half of the patients (20) had the symptomatic
              sacroiliac joint injected with 4 ml of 1\% lignocaine, whereas
              the other 20 patients received 4 ml of normal saline to the
              painful joint. The level of pain produced by each of the three
              tests was assessed pre- and posttest injection using a visual
              analogue scale of 0-100. If the pain could be suppressed by 70\%
              with injection of either normal saline or 1\% lignocaine into the
              symptomatic sacroiliac joint under image intensification, the
              test was considered to be positive for pain arising from the
              sacroiliac joint. None of the patients receiving normal saline
              had their pain suppressed to any significant degree, whereas
              those patients receiving 1\% lignocaine had their pain suppressed
              sufficiently for the three pain provocation tests to have a
              specificity of 100\% for each test and a sensitivity range of
              77-87\%. This study indicates that the three tests, when used in

              unilateral hip osteoarthritis and 19 healthy controls were
              investigated. The subjects performed a stepping task during which
              recordings were obtained using surface electromyograms from the

              including patients with dominant nociceptive (e.g., myofascial
              low back pain), neuropathic (e.g., lumbar radiculopathy), and
              central sensitization pain. In order to select an effective and
              preferably also efficient treatment in daily clinical practice,
              LBP patients should be classified clinically as either
              predominantly nociceptive, neuropathic, or central sensitization
              pain. OBJECTIVE:To explain how clinicians can differentiate
              between nociceptive, neuropathic, and central sensitization pain
              in patients with LBP. STUDY DESIGN:Narrative review and expert
              opinion SETTING:Universities, university hospitals and private
              practices METHODS:Recently, a clinical method for the
              classification of central sensitization pain versus neuropathic
              and nociceptive pain was developed. It is based on a body of
              evidence of original research papers and expert opinion of 18
              pain experts from 7 different countries. Here we apply this
              classification algorithm to the LBP population. RESULTS:The first
              step implies examining the presence of neuropathic low back pain.
              Next, the differential diagnosis between predominant nociceptive
              and central sensitization pain is done using a clinical
              algorithm. LIMITATIONS:The classification criteria are
              substantiated by several original research findings including a
              Delphi survey, a study of a large group of LBP patients, and
              validation studies of the Central Sensitization Inventory.
              Nevertheless, these criteria require validation in clinical
              settings. CONCLUSION:The pain classification system for LBP
              should be an addition to available classification systems and
              diagnostic procedures for LBP, as it is focussed on pain
              mechanisms solely.",

  author   = "Bronfort, G and Evans, R and Nelson, B and Aker, P D and
              Goldsmith, C H and Vernon, H",
  abstract = "STUDY DESIGN: A randomized, parallel-group, single-blinded
              clinical trial was performed. After a 1-week baseline period,
              patients were randomized to 11 weeks of therapy, with
              posttreatment follow-up assessment 3, 6, and 12 months later.
              OBJECTIVES: To compare the relative efficacy of rehabilitative
              neck exercise and spinal manipulation for the management of
              patients with chronic neck pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:
              Mechanical neck pain is a common condition associated with
              substantial morbidity and cost. Relatively little is known about
              the efficacy of spinal manipulation and exercise for chronic neck
              pain. Also, the combination of both therapies has yet to be
              explored. METHODS: Altogether, 191 patients with chronic
              mechanical neck pain were randomized to receive 20 sessions of
              spinal manipulation combined with rehabilitative neck exercise
              (spinal manipulation with exercise), MedX rehabilitative neck
              exercise, or spinal manipulation alone. The main outcome measures
              were patient-rated neck pain, neck disability, functional health
              status (as measured by Short Form-36 [SF-36]), global
              improvement, satisfaction with care, and medication use. Range of
              motion, muscle strength, and muscle endurance were assessed by
              examiners blinded to patients' treatment assignment. RESULTS:
              Clinical and demographic characteristics were similar among
              groups at baseline. A total of 93\% of the patients completed the
              intervention phase. The response rate for the 12-month follow-up
              period was 84\%. Except for patient satisfaction, where spinal
              manipulative therapy and exercise were superior to spinal
              manipulation with (P = 0.03), the group differences in
              patient-rated outcomes after 11 weeks of treatment were not
              statistically significant (P = 0.13). However, the spinal
              manipulative therapy and exercise group showed greater gains in
              all measures of strength, endurance, and range of motion than the
              spinal manipulation group (P < 0.05). The spinal manipulation
              with exercise group also demonstrated more improvement in flexion
              endurance and in flexion and rotation strength than the MedX
              group (P < 0.03). The MedX exercise group had larger gains in
              extension strength and flexion-extension range of motion than the
              spinal manipulation group (P < 0.05). During the follow-up year,
              a greater improvement in patient-rated outcomes were observed for
              spinal manipulation with exercise and for MedX exercise than for
              spinal manipulation alone (P = 0.01). Both exercise groups showed
              very similar levels of improvement in patient-rated outcomes,
              although the spinal manipulation and exercise group reported
              greater satisfaction with care (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: For
              chronic neck pain, the use of strengthening exercise, whether in
              combination with spinal manipulation or in the form of a
              high-technology MedX program, appears to be more beneficial to
              patients with chronic neck pain than the use of spinal
              manipulation alone. The effect of low-technology exercise or
              spinal manipulative therapy alone, as compared with no treatment
              or placebo, and the optimal dose and relative cost effectiveness
              of these therapies, need to be evaluated in future studies.",

              nonpharmacological interventions for fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS).
              The authors therefore carried out a systematic review from 1980
              to May 2000 of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of
              nonpharmacological interventions for FMS. METHOD:A search of
              computerized databases was supplemented by hand searching of
              bibliographies of key publications. The methodological quality of
              studies included in the review was evaluated independently by two
              researchers according to a set of formal criteria. Discrepancies
              in scoring were resolved through discussion. RESULTS:The review
              yielded 25 RCTs, and the main categories of interventions tested
              in the studies were exercise therapy, educational intervention,
              relaxation therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, acupuncture,
              and forms of hydrotherapy. Methodological quality of studies was
              fairly low (mean score = 49.5/100). Most studies had small
              samples (median for individual treatment groups after
              randomization = 20), and the mean power of the studies to detect
              a medium effect ( > or = 0.5) was 0.36. Sixteen studies had
              blinded outcome assessment, but patients were blinded in only 6
              studies. The median longest follow-up was 16 weeks. Statistically
              significant between-group differences on at least one outcome
              variable were reported in 17 of the 24 studies. CONCLUSIONS:The
              varying combinations of interventions studied in the RCTs and the
              wide range of outcome measures used make it hard to form
              conclusions across studies. Strong evidence did not emerge in
              respect to any single intervention, though preliminary support of
              moderate strength existed for aerobic exercise. There is a need
              for larger, more methodologically rigorous RCTs in this area.",

              33-year-old male with a 21-year history of low back pain and left
              posterior thigh pain who presented with lumbar hypomobility and
              met a previously published clinical prediction rule for spinal
              manipulation. During examination, the patient was asked to
              perform a prone upper extremity lifting task to assess activation
              in the lumbar multifidus during an automatic task. Through
              palpation the examiner noted a decreased contraction of the left
              multifidus between L4-S1 compared to the right. To explore this
              further, a decision was made to assess the multifidus with RUSI,
              which confirmed the activation deficit noted during palpation. A
              lumbar regional manipulation was performed with the intention of
              reducing spinal hypomobility and of assessing changes in
              multifidus activation. Imaging of the multifidus muscles at the
              L4-5 and L5-S1 levels were obtained premanipulation, immediately
              postmanipulation, and 1 day after manipulation. OUTCOMES:An
              increased ability to thicken the multifidus during a prone upper
              extremity lifting task was noted immediately and 1 day after
              manipulation. Average percent change in thickness at the L4-5 and
              L5-S1 levels with the prone arm lift was 3.6\% premanipulation,
              17.2\% immediately postmanipulation, and 20.6\% approximately 24
              hours postmanipulation. Improvements in the thickening of the
              multifidus muscle during the upper extremity lifting task were
              greater than 3 standard errors of the measurement. Other changes
              included immediate palpable improvement in the contraction of the
              multifidus during the upper extremity lifting task, along with
              the patient report of increased ease of lifting. DISCUSSION:In
              this case report we quantified the short-term influence of spinal
              manipulation on multifidus muscular activation using RUSI. No
              cause-and-effect claims can be made; however, the results provide
              preliminary evidence to suggest that spinal manipulation may
              influence multifidus muscle function. RUSI offers a convenient
              way to investigate and document these changes.",

              predictors of a primary source of the pain (a hip or a spine

               devices, the IDEAL framework is based on the principle that
               innovation and evaluation in clinical practice can, and should,
               evolve together in an ordered manner: from conception to
               development and then to validation by appropriate clinical
               studies and, finally, longer-term follow-up. This framework is
               highly suited to other complex, nonpharmacological
               interventions, such as physical therapist interventions. This
               perspective outlines the application of IDEAL to physical
               therapy in the new IDEAL-Physio framework. The IDEAL-Physio
               framework comprises 5 stages. In stage 1, the idea phase, formal
               data collection should begin. Stage 2a is the phase for
               iterative improvement and adjustment with thorough data
               recording. Stage 2b involves the onset of formal evaluation

               the phase for formal comparative assessment of treatment,

               follow-up. The IDEAL-Physio framework is recommended as a method

               acute episode of low back pain (LBP) and radiculopathy
               participated in a single preoperative TNE session. She completed

              level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
              determine if supraspinal activation in response to noxious
              mechanical stimuli varies pre- and post-thrust manipulation to
              the thoracic spine. BACKGROUND:Recent studies have demonstrated
              the effectiveness of thoracic thrust manipulation in reducing
              pain and improving function in some individuals with neck and
              shoulder pain. However, the mechanisms by which manipulation
              exerts such effects remain largely unexplained. The use of fMRI
              in the animal model has revealed a decrease in cortical activity
              in response to noxious stimuli following manual joint
              mobilization. Supraspinal mediation contributing to hypoalgesia
              in humans may be triggered following spinal manipulation.
              METHODS:Ten healthy volunteers (5 women, 5 men) between the ages
              of 23 and 48 years (mean, 31.2 years) were recruited. Subjects
              underwent fMRI scanning while receiving noxious stimuli applied
              to the cuticle of the index finger at a rate of 1 Hz for periods
              of 15 seconds, alternating with periods of 15 seconds without
              stimuli, for a total duration of 5 minutes. Subjects then
              received a supine thrust manipulation directed to the midthoracic
              spine and were immediately returned to the scanner for reimaging
              with a second delivery of noxious stimuli. An 11-point numeric
              pain rating scale was administered immediately after the
              application of noxious stimuli, premanipulation and
              postmanipulation. Blood oxygenation level-dependent fMRI recorded
              the cerebral hemodynamic response to the painful stimuli
              premanipulation and postmanipulation. RESULTS:The data indicated
              a significant reduction in subjects' perception of pain (P<.01),
              as well as a reduction in cerebral blood flow as measured by the
              blood oxygenation level-dependent response following manipulation
              to areas associated with the pain matrix (P<.05). There was a
              significant relationship between reduced activation in the
              insular cortex and decreased subjective pain ratings on the
              numeric pain rating scale (r = 0.59, P<.05). CONCLUSION:This
              study provides preliminary evidence that suggests that
              supraspinal mechanisms may be associated with thoracic thrust
              manipulation and hypoalgesia. However, because the study lacked a
              control group, the results do not allow for the discernment of
              the causative effects of manipulation, which may also be related
              to changes in levels of subjects' fear, anxiety, or expectation
              of successful outcomes with manipulation. Future investigations
              should strive to elicit more conclusive findings in the form of
              randomized clinical trials.",

              report problems caused by wheat and/or gluten ingestion, even
              though they do not have celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy
              (WA), because they test negative both for CD-specific serology
              and histopathology and for immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated
              assays. Most patients report both gastrointestinal and
              nongastrointestinal symptoms, and all report improvement of
              symptoms on a gluten-free diet. This clinical condition has been
              named non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). AIM:We attempt to
              define the current pathogenic, clinical, and diagnostic criteria
              of this ``new'' disease, to provide a practical view that might
              be useful to evaluate, diagnose, and manage NCGS patients.
              METHODS:We reviewed the international literature through PubMed
              and Medline, using the search terms ``wheat (hyper)sensitivity,''
              ``wheat allergy,'' ``wheat intolerance,'' ``gluten
              (hyper)sensitivity,'' and ``gluten intolerance,'' and we discuss
              current knowledge about NCGS. RESULTS:It has been demonstrated
              that patients suffering from NCGS are a heterogeneous group,
              composed of several subgroups, each characterized by different
              pathogenesis, clinical history, and, probably, clinical course.
              NCGS diagnosis can be reached only by excluding CD and WA. Recent
              evidence shows that a personal history of food allergy in
              infancy, coexistent atopy, positive for immunoglobulin G (IgG)
              antigliadin antibodies and flow cytometric basophil activation
              test, with wheat and duodenal and/or ileum-colon intraepithelial
              and lamina propria eosinophil counts, could be useful to identify
              NCGS patients. CONCLUSIONS:Future research should aim to identify
              reliable biomarkers for NCGS diagnosis and to better define the
              different NCGS subgroups. Key teaching points: • Most patients
              report both gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal symptoms,
              and all agree that there is an improvement of symptoms on a
              gluten-free diet. • NCGS diagnosis can be reached only by
              excluding celiac disease and wheat allergy. • Patients suffering
              from NCGS are a heterogeneous group, composed of several
              subgroups, each characterized by different pathogenesis, clinical
              history, and, probably, clinical course. • A personal history of
              food allergy in infancy, coexistent atopy, positive IgG
              antigliadin antibodies (AGA) and flow cytometric basophil
              activation test, with wheat and duodenal and/or ileum-colon
              intraepithelial and lamina propria eosinophil counts, could be
              useful to identify NCGS patients. • Future research should aim to
              identify reliable biomarkers for NCGS diagnosis and to better
              define the different NCGS subgroup.",

               to interpret. Several methods to determine minimally important
               changes (MICs) have been proposed which can broadly be divided
               in distribution-based and anchor-based methods. Comparisons of
               these methods have led to insight into essential differences
               between these approaches. Some authors have tried to come to a
               uniform measure for the MIC, such as 0.5 standard deviation and
               the value of one standard error of measurement (SEM). Others
               have emphasized the diversity of MIC values, depending on the
               type of anchor, the definition of minimal importance on the
               anchor, and characteristics of the disease under study. A closer
               look makes clear that some distribution-based methods have been
               merely focused on minimally detectable changes. For assessing
               minimally important changes, anchor-based methods are preferred,
               as they include a definition of what is minimally important.
               Acknowledging the distinction between minimally detectable and
               minimally important changes is useful, not only to avoid
               confusion among MIC methods, but also to gain information on two
               important benchmarks on the scale of a health status measurement
               instrument. Appreciating the distinction, it becomes possible to
               judge whether the minimally detectable change of a measurement
               instrument is sufficiently small to detect minimally important
               changes.",

               calcaneal fracture, rupture of the plantar fascia and atrophy of

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND:Neck pain is a widespread complaint. People
               experiencing neck pain often present an altered timing in
               contraction of cervical muscles. This altered afferent
               information elicits the cervico-ocular reflex (COR), which
               stabilizes the eye in response to trunk-to-head movements. The
               vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) elicited by the vestibulum is
               thought to be unaffected by afferent information from the
               cervical spine. OBJECTIVE:The aim of the study was to measure
               the COR and VOR in people with nonspecific neck pain.
               DESIGN:This study utilized a cross-sectional design in
               accordance with the STROBE statement. METHODS:An infrared
               eye-tracking device was used to record the COR and the VOR while
               the participant was sitting on a rotating chair in darkness. Eye
               velocity was calculated by taking the derivative of the
               horizontal eye position. Parametric statistics were performed.
               RESULTS:The mean COR gain in the control group (n=30) was 0.26
               (SD=0.15) compared with 0.38 (SD=0.16) in the nonspecific neck
               pain group (n=37). Analyses of covariance were performed to
               analyze differences in COR and VOR gains, with age and sex as
               covariates. Analyses of covariance showed a significantly
               increased COR in participants with neck pain. The VOR between
               the control group, with a mean VOR of 0.67 (SD=0.17), and the
               nonspecific neck pain group, with a mean VOR of 0.66 (SD=0.22),
               was not significantly different. LIMITATIONS:Measuring eye
               movements while the participant is sitting on a rotating chair
               in complete darkness is technically complicated.
               CONCLUSIONS:This study suggests that people with nonspecific
               neck pain have an increased COR. The COR is an objective,
               nonvoluntary eye reflex and an unaltered VOR. This study shows
               that an increased COR is not restricted to patients with
               traumatic neck pain.",

              loading and kinematics of the entire lower extremity during
              ground contact. Previously injured subjects demonstrate altered
              lower extremity stiffness values. Clinical analysis of lower
              extremity stiffness is not currently feasible due to increased
              time and cost. OBJECTIVE:To determine the clinically identifiable
              contributors to lower extremity stiffness. METHODS:In this
              cross-sectional controlled laboratory study, 92 healthy runners
              completed a clinical screening involving passive assessment of
              hip, knee, and ankle range of motion, along with body
              anthropometrics. The range of motion was predominantly assessed
              in the sagittal and frontal planes. In the same session, runners
              completed an overground kinematic and kinetic running assessment
              at 3.35 m/s ($\pm$5\%) to obtain lower extremity stiffness.
              Correlations between lower extremity stiffness and clinical
              variables were completed. Modifiable variables were included in
              an all-possible-linear regressions approach to determine a
              parsimonious model for predicting lower extremity stiffness.
              RESULTS:Clinically modifiable measures included in the regression
              model accounted for 48.4\% of the variance of lower extremity
              stiffness during running. The variables that predicted greater
              stiffness included greater body mass, less ankle dorsiflexion
              range of motion with the knee flexed, less hip internal rotation
              range of motion, and less first-ray mobility. CONCLUSION:Reduced
              lower extremity range of motion and greater body mass are
              associated with greater lower extremity stiffness during running.
              These variables could be addressed clinically to potentially
              alter lower extremity stiffness and injury risk. J Orthop Sports

  abstract = "BACKGROUND:Adequate relief from low-back pain (LBP) is not always
              possible. Emerging evidence suggests a role for botulinum
              neurotoxin (BoNT) injections in treating pain disorders.
              Proponents of BoNT suggest its properties can decrease muscle
              spasms, ischemia and inflammatory markers, thereby reducing pain.
              OBJECTIVES:To determine the effects of botulinum toxin injections
              in adults with LBP. SEARCH STRATEGY:We searched CENTRAL (The
              Cochrane Library 2009, issue 3) and MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL
              to August 2009; screened references from included studies;
              consulted with content experts and Allergan. We included
              published and unpublished randomised controlled trials without
              language restrictions SELECTION CRITERIA:We included randomised
              trials that evaluated BoNT serotypes versus other treatments in
              patients with non-specific LBP of any duration. DATA COLLECTION
              AND ANALYSIS:Two review authors selected the studies, assessed
              the risk of bias using the Cochrane Back Review Group criteria,
              and extracted the data using standardized forms. We performed a
              qualitative analysis due to lack of data. MAIN RESULTS:We
              excluded evidence from nineteen studies due to non-randomisation,
              incomplete or unpublished data. We included three randomised
              trials (N =123 patients). Only one study included patients with
              chronic non-specific LBP; the other two examined unique
              subpopulations. Only one of the three trials had a low risk of
              bias and demonstrated that BoNT injections reduced pain at three
              and eight weeks and improved function at eight weeks better than
              saline injections. The second trial showed that BoNT injections
              were better than injections of corticosteroid plus lidocaine or
              placebo in patients with sciatica attributed to piriformis
              syndrome. The third trial concluded that BoNT injections were
              better than traditional acupuncture in patients with third lumbar
              transverse process syndrome. Both studies with high risk of bias
              had several key limitations. Heterogeneity of the studies
              prevented meta-analysis. There is low quality evidence that BoNT
              injections improved pain, function, or both better than saline
              injections and very low quality evidence that they were better
              than acupuncture or steroid injections. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:We
              identified three studies that investigated the merits of BoNT for
              LBP, but only one had a low risk of bias and evaluated patients
              with non-specific LBP (N = 31). Further research is very likely
              to have an important impact on the estimate of effect and our
              confidence in it. Future trials should standardize patient
              populations, treatment protocols and comparison groups, enlist
              more participants and include long-term outcomes, cost-benefit
              analysis and clinical relevance of findings.",

               many cases of 'unexplained' chronic musculoskeletal pain. Prior

               change maladaptive illness perceptions, to alter maladaptive
               pain cognitions and to reconceptualise pain. This can be
               accomplished by patient education about central sensitization
               and its role in chronic pain, a strategy known as pain
               physiology education. Pain physiology education is indicated
               when: 1) the clinical picture is characterized and dominated by
               central sensitization; and 2) maladaptive illness perceptions
               are present. Both are prerequisites for commencing pain
               physiology education. Face-to-face sessions of pain physiology
               education, in conjunction with written educational material, are
               effective for changing pain cognitions and improving health
               status in patients with various chronic musculoskeletal pain
               disorders. These include patients with chronic low back pain,
               chronic whiplash, fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome.

               comprises of a first face-to-face session explaining basic pain
               physiology and contrasting acute nociception versus chronic pain
               (Session 1). Written information about pain physiology should be
               provided as homework in between session 1 and 2. The second
               session can be used to correct misunderstandings, and to
               facilitate the transition from knowledge to adaptive pain coping
               during daily life. Pain physiology education is a continuous

  author    = "Collins, John P",
  abstract  = "Measures of clinical significance have been in use for several
               decades as a means of interpreting clinical findings and
               patient-reported outcomes. The most common of these measures is
               the minimal clinically important difference. With the rise in
               popularity of measurements of clinical significance, several
               common misconceptions have arisen that may impact their
               interpretation and application to clinical practice. The purpose
               of this article is to present a schema for understanding
               measurement of clinical significance and use this to highlight
               the reasons why misuse and misinterpretation have occurred. A
               new measure of clinical significance is then defined that is
               intended to be resistant to these issues. Clinical significance
               has long been a topic of importance to researchers looking to
               make their findings interpretable and has been quantified in
               diverse ways.1 Recently, there has been rapidly increasing
               interest in and use of an assortment of minimal (clinically)
               important difference measures. The range of their use is
               illustrated by the publications of reviews and meta-analyses in
               pain relief,2 cognitive interventions for dementia,3 and CT
               densitometry for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
               disease.4 Consensus has not been reached for how clinical
               significance should be defined. Despite this, current methods
               fall into 2 distinct approaches. The first estimates measurement
               error levels, and the other quantifies the ability of the
               instrument to predict clinical outcomes of interest. The
               conceptual differences between the 2 approaches have not been
               clearly delineated in the literature. Further, additional
               conceptual and practical issues exist for measures using the
               second approach because it has not previously been framed as a
               clinical prediction problem. It is the aim of this paper to
               develop a framework to guide researchers in the use of clinical
               importance measures and to introduce a new methodology for
               predicting clinically meaningful change. We first propose 2
               types of clinical significance measures relating to what we call
               the Detection and Clinical Prediction Problems. Next, we discuss
               weaknesses of existing measures of clinical prediction within
               this unifying framework. Finally, we define a new measure of
               clinical significance using predictive values and demonstrate
               its use with simulated data.",

  abstract  = "Background:Texting while walking (TeWW) has become common among
               people of all ages, and mobile phone use during gait is
               increasingly associated with pedestrian injury. Although
               dual-task walking performance is known to decline with age, data
               regarding the effect of age on dual-task performance in
               ecological settings are limited. Objective:The objective of this
               study was to evaluate the effect of age, environment
               (indoors/outdoors), and mixed reality (merging of real and
               virtual environments) on TeWW performance. Design:A
               cross-sectional design was used. Methods:Young (n = 30; 27.8
               $\pm$ 4.4 years) and older (n = 20; 68.9 $\pm$ 3.9 years) adults
               performed single- and dual-task texting and walking indoors and
               outdoors, with and without a mixed reality display. Participants
               also completed evaluations of visual scanning and cognitive
               flexibility (Trail Making Test) and functional mobility (Timed
               ``Up \& Go'' Test). Results:Indoors, similar interference to
               walking and texting occurred for both groups, but only older
               adults' gait variability increased under dual task conditions.
               Outdoors, TeWW was associated with larger age-related
               differences in gait variability, texting accuracy, and gait
               dual-task costs. Young adults with better visual scanning and
               cognitive flexibility performed TeWW with lower gait costs (r =
               0.52-0.65). The mixed reality display was unhelpful and did not
               modify walking or texting. Limitations:Older adults tested in
               this study were relatively high functioning. Gaze of
               participants was not directly monitored. Conclusions:Although
               young and older adults possess the resources necessary for TeWW,
               older adults pay an additional ``price'' when dual-tasking,
               especially outdoors. TeWW may have potential as an ecologically
               valid assessment and/or an intervention paradigm for dual-task

               methods are attracting increased attention due to evidence of
               effectiveness similar to that of traditional therapies. The
               purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of
               performing a cognitive intervention based on a non-injury model
               with that of a symptom-based physical training method on the
               outcomes of low back pain (LBP), activity limitation, LBP
               attitudes (fear-avoidance beliefs and back beliefs), physical
               activity levels, sick leave, and quality of life, in chronic LBP
               patients. METHODS: The study was a pragmatic, single-blind,
               randomised, parallel-group trial. Patients with
               chronic/recurrent LBP were randomised to one of the following
               treatments: 1. Educational programme : the emphasis was on
               creating confidence that the back is strong, that loads normally
               do not cause any damage despite occasional temporary pain, that
               reducing the focus on the pain might facilitate more natural and
               less painful movements, and that it is beneficial to stay
               physically active. 2. Individual symptom-based physical training
               programme : directional-preference exercises for those
               centralising their pain with repetitive movements; 'stabilising
               exercises' for those deemed 'unstable' based on specific tests;
               or intensive dynamic exercises for the remaining patients.
               Follow-up questionnaires (examiner-blinded) were completed at 2,
               6 and 12 months. The main statistical test was an ANCOVA
               adjusted for baseline values. RESULTS: A total of 207 patients
               participated with the median age of 39 years (IQR 33-47); 52\%
               were female, 105 were randomised to the educational programme
               and 102 to the physical training programme. The two groups were
               comparable at baseline. For the primary outcome measures, there
               was a non-significant trend towards activity limitation being
               reduced mostly in the educational programme group, although of
               doubtful clinical relevance. Regarding secondary outcomes,
               improvement in fear-avoidance beliefs was also better in the
               educational programme group. All other variables were about
               equally influenced by the two treatments. The median number of
               treatment sessions was 3 for the educational programme group and
               6 for the physical training programme group. CONCLUSIONS: An
               educational approach to treatment for chronic LBP resulted in at
               least as good outcomes as a symptom-based physical training
               method, despite fewer treatment sessions.",

  abstract  = "The use of upper limb neural tension testing (ULNTT) and neural
               mobilization by physical and occupational therapists has become
               common in clinical practice. The purpose of this article is to
               discuss the basic science and the research that supports or
               refutes the efficacy of these techniques. There is sufficient
               biomechanical evidence that the peripheral nerve under tension
               undergoes strain and glides within its interfacing tissue.
               Evidence supports that ULNTT causes strain within the peripheral
               nervous system however; it is also evident that ULNTT places
               strain on other multisegmental tissues. Clinical investigation
               has examined intrarater reliability and has begun to define the
               parameters of a positive test but there is lack of randomized
               controlled studies. There is limited evidence reporting
               favorable outcomes when using neural mobilization to treat
               specific patient populations, and the appropriate parameters of
               dosage (i.e., duration, frequency, and amplitude) remain to be
               confirmed. Clinical application of these techniques must be
               applied in a practical manner that relies on continual clinical
               reasoning. The clinician should integrate basic science and
               experimental evidence as we work to achieve a sufficient level
               of confidence in the development of evidence-based practice.",

  abstract = "Current elbow-scoring systems are based on the observer-derived
              assessment of a variety of clinical and functional criteria,
              which are scored separately and then aggregated. The aggregate
              score then is assigned a categorical ranking that ranges from
              excellent to poor. The developers of different elbow-scoring
              systems have chosen different outcome criteria, assigned
              different weights to each criterion, and accorded different
              ranges of values to each categorical ranking. Five different
              elbow-scoring systems (the Mayo elbow-performance index and the
              systems of Broberg and Morrey, Ewald et al., The Hospital for
              Special Surgery, and Pritchard) were used to evaluate the same
              group of patients. The validity of the scoring systems was
              determined with use of visual-analog scales for the assessment of
              pain and function, patient and physician-derived ratings of the
              severity of impairment of the elbow, and two functional
              questionnaires completed by the patient (the Disabilities of the
              Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire and the Modified American
              Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons patient self-evaluation form). The
              study sample consisted of sixty-nine patients who had sought
              treatment at one of two tertiary referral clinics because of
              problems related to the elbow. Pearson product-moment correlation
              coefficients were used to compare the raw aggregate scores, and
              kappa statistics were used to determine the level of agreement
              among the categorical rankings (excellent, good, fair, and poor).
              Examination of the five scoring systems revealed a remarkable
              lack of concordance with regard to the aspects of elbow function
              that were assessed. Good correlation was observed when the
              systems were compared on the basis of raw scores (Pearson
              product-moment correlation coefficients, 0.79 to 0.90), but only
              slight-to-moderate correlation was noted when the systems were
              compared on the basis of categorical rankings (quadratic weighted
              kappa coefficients, 0.18 to 0.49). Validity testing showed the
              system of Ewald et al. and the Mayo elbow-performance index to be
              the most discriminating, the system of Pritchard to be the least
              discriminating, and the system of The Hospital for Special
              Surgery and the system of Broberg and Morrey to be intermediate.
              The scores determined with the elbow-scoring systems demonstrated
              only moderate correlation with the score for function on the
              visual analog scale (Pearson product-moment correlation
              coefficients, 0.44 to 0.66), whereas those derived from the
              functional questionnaires completed by the patient demonstrated
              moderate-to-good correlation with the score for function (Pearson
              product-moment correlation coefficients, 0.72 and 0.80).",

               drugs (NSAID) with particular emphasis on cyclooxygenase-2
               selective inhibitors (coxibs). METHODS:Needs assessments were

               educational needs surrounding NSAID/coxibs. A survey of patients
               with arthritis was also conducted. Consensus participants
               reviewed articles relating to NSAID/coxibs in peer-reviewed
               journals between January 2000 and December 2004. At the
               consensus meeting, held January 21-23, 2005, participants
               discussed selected topics, after which recommendations were
               formulated and debated. Results. At the time of the meeting, it
               was agreed that emerging cardiovascular data were not clear
               enough to decide whether unanticipated cardiovascular events
               associated with coxibs represent a class effect or an effect of
               an individual drug. However, publications that appeared shortly
               after the meeting, as well as data presented at both the Joint
               Meeting of the Arthritis Advisory Committee and the Drug Safety
               and Risk Management Advisory Committee of the US Food and Drug
               Administration, February 16-18, 2005, and Health Canada's Expert
               Advisory Panel on the Safety of Cox-2 Selective NSAID, June
               9-10, 2005, clarified that all available coxibs do carry some
               degree of cardiovascular risk, denoting a class effect. Our
               consensus group made the following specific recommendations: (1)
               Patients should be fully informed about treatment options,
               including the need to balance between cardiovascular risks and
               gastrointestinal (GI) benefits of NSAID/coxibs. (2) Coxibs are
               as effective as nonselective NSAID and superior to acetaminophen
               for the symptoms of arthritis. Topical NSAID may also be
               beneficial. (3) Coxibs are associated with fewer severe GI
               complications than nonselective NSAID. A proton pump inhibitor
               (PPI) should be prescribed if an NSAID must be used in a patient
               at increased GI risk. (4) The renal/blood pressure (BP) impact
               of coxibs is similar to that of NSAID. (5) In individuals at
               risk, creatinine clearance and BP should be determined at
               baseline and shortly after treatment begins. (6) In the
               geriatric population, use of nonpharmacological therapies should
               be maximized, and special caution is required before prescribing
               oral NSAID/coxibs. (7) Patients taking rofecoxib have been shown
               to have an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Current data
               suggest that this increased cardiovascular risk may be an effect
               of the NSAID/coxib class. (8) Although the data are limited,
               coxibs may be more cost-effective for patients at high GI risk
               than nonselective NSAID plus proprietary PPI. CONCLUSION:Coxibs
               continue to be an option in the treatment armamentarium. Given
               the evolving cardiovascular information, physicians and patients
               should weigh the benefits and risks of NSAID/coxib treatment.
               This concern emphasizes the need to routinely reassess patients'
               risks. These recommendations, which were formulated according to
               the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation, are
               intended to be used as guidelines to supplement, but not
               replace, the physician's judgment in clinical decision-making.",

              surgical treatment for rupture of the intervertebral disc in
              1934, open surgical procedures have become a common practice.
              Disc herniations have been reported as being contained and
              non-contained. The results of open surgical discectomy for
              contained disc herniation have been poor. Consequently, several
              alternative techniques have been developed which are minimally
              invasive including percutaneous laser disc decompression. STUDY
              DESIGN:A systematic review of the literature. OBJECTIVE:The
              objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the clinical
              effectiveness of percutaneous laser discectomy in managing
              radicular pain secondary to contained disc herniation. METHODS:A
              comprehensive evaluation of the literature relating to mechanical
              disc decompression was performed. The literature was evaluated
              according to Cochrane review criteria for randomized controlled
              trials (RCTs), and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
              (AHRQ) criteria was utilized for observational studies. A
              literature search was conducted by using only the English
              language literature through PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane library,
              systematic reviews, and cross references from reviews and
              systematic reviews. The level of evidence was classified as Level
              I, II, or III with 3 subcategories in Level II based on the
              quality of evidence developed by the United States Preventive
              Services Task Force (USPSTF). OUTCOME MEASURES:Pain relief was
              the primary outcome measure. Other outcome measures were
              functional improvement, improvement of psychological status,
              opioid intake, and return to work. Short-term effectiveness was
              defined as one year or less, whereas, long-term effectiveness was
              defined as greater than one year. RESULTS:Based on USPSTF
              criteria the indicated level of evidence for percutaneous lumbar
              laser discectomy (PLLD) is II-2 for short- and long-term relief.
              LIMITATIONS:Even though laser discectomy has been in utilization
              for a number of years and numerous procedures have been performed
              there continues to be a paucity of literature of randomized
              clinical trials. CONCLUSION:This systematic review illustrates
              Level II-2 evidence for percutaneous laser disc decompression
              which is equivalent to automated percutaneous lumbar disc
              decompression.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE:To investigate whether adolescent elite female and male
              handball players with shoulder muscle weakness, deficits in
              shoulder rotation range of motion (ROM) or in joint position
              sense (JPS), or scapular dyskinesis in the preseason had a higher
              rate of new shoulder injuries compared to players without these
              characteristics. DESIGN:Prospective cohort study. METHODS:We
              studied 344 uninjured players (452 player-seasons, 50\% female).
              We measured their shoulder strength in isometric external
              rotation (IER), isometric internal rotation (IIR), isometric
              abduction, and eccentric external rotation, as well as their
              shoulder ROM, JPS, and scapular dyskinesis, during the preseason.
              Players were monitored weekly regarding match and training hours
              and shoulder injuries during 1 or 2 seasons. We used
              multivariable Cox proportional hazard models to calculate hazard
              rate ratios related to the first injury and 95\% confidence
              intervals (CIs). RESULTS:During 2 seasons, the participants
              reported 48 new shoulder injuries. In female players, the hazard
              rate ratio was 2.37 (95\% CI: 1.03, 5.44) for IER weakness and
              2.44 (95\% CI: 1.06, 5.61) for IIR weakness. The hazard rate
              ratio was 0.85 (95\% CI: 0.39, 1.83) for an IER/IIR ratio of less
              than 0.75 and 1.53 (95\% CI: 0.36, 6.52) for scapular dyskinesis.
              In male players, the hazard rate ratio was 1.02 (95\% CI: 0.44,
              2.36) for IER weakness, 0.74 (95\% CI: 0.31, 1.75) for IIR
              weakness, 2.0 (95\% CI: 0.68, 5.92) for an IER/IIR ratio of less
              than 0.75, and 3.43 (95\% CI: 1.49, 7.92) for scapular
              dyskinesis. There were no associations between new shoulder
              injuries and deficits in ROM or JPS. CONCLUSION:In adolescent

              low back pain (LBP) is conflicting. The aim of this study was to
              examine its efficacy in this disorder. Forty-two patients with at
              least 6 weeks of nonspecific LBP were selected. Demographic data
              were obtained. All patients completed the Oswestry disability
              index (ODI) to assess disability and the 10-cm visual analog
              scale (VAS) for evaluation of pain. Subjects were randomly
              assigned into group 1, receiving only standard physical therapy,
              or group 2, receiving standard physical therapy with conventional
              lumbar traction. Standard physical therapy consisted of local
              heat, ultrasound for the lumbar region, and an active exercise
              program, given for ten sessions in all. The subjects received
              instruction on correct posture and recommended therapeutic
              exercises. They were reevaluated at the end of treatment and at
              3-month follow-up. The mean outcome measures were global
              improvement and satisfaction with the therapy, as well as
              disability by ODI and pain by VAS. There were no group
              differences in terms of demographic and baseline clinical
              characteristics. There was a significant reduction in pain
              intensity and disability at the end of treatment in both groups.
              There was complete or mild improvement in 47.6\% of group 1 and
              40\% of group 2. The satisfaction rate with both treatments was
              more than 70\% immediately after the therapies. During the
              3-month period, the outcome measures except disability remained
              statistically stable, with no difference amongst groups.
              Disability was significantly reduced at follow-up in both groups.
              Of the patients, 51\% continued with the recommended exercises
              and had significantly lower disability scores than those who did
              not continue with the exercises. Pain and global improvement were
              also better in this group, but the difference was not
              statistically significant. In conclusion, no specific effect of
              traction on standard physical therapy was observed in our study
              group. We suggest focusing on back education and exercise therapy
              in the management of patients suffering from this chronic

  abstract = "Low back pain (LBP) is a common complaint within the athletic
              population and is commonly managed through a biomedical approach.
              The injured or damaged structure causing the LBP is identified
              and treated, and complete recovery from the episode is expected.
              Clinical experience shows us that often, athletes with LBP will
              not recover from their episode and may continue their sports
              participation despite persistent pain, or they may limit
              participation. Recent neuroscience research into the biology of
              pain suggests that clinicians involved in the management of
              athletes with LBP should embrace a biopsychosocial approach by
              engaging the brain and nervous system. This manuscript provides
              an overview of such a biopsychosocial approach, and presents

              7 patients with grade 1 cervical compressive myelopathy
              attributed to herniated disc using intermittent cervical traction
              and manipulation of the thoracic spine. BACKGROUND:Intermittent
              cervical traction has been indicated for the treatment of
              patients with herniated disc and has been suggested to be helpful
              for patients with cervical compressive myelopathy. Manipulation
              of the thoracic spine has been utilized to safely improve active
              range of motion and decrease pain in patients with neck pain.
              METHODS AND MEASURES:Seven women with neck pain, 35 to 45 years
              of age, were identified as having signs and symptoms consistent
              with grade 1 cervical compressive myelopathy. Symptom duration
              ranged from less than 1 week to 52 weeks. All patients were
              treated with intermittent cervical traction and thoracic
              manipulation for a median of 9 sessions (range, 2-12 sessions)
              over a median of 56 days (range, 14-146 days). Numeric Pain
              Rating Scale and Functional Rating Index scores served as the
              primary outcome measures. RESULTS:The median decrease in pain
              scores was 5 (range, 2-8) from a baseline of 6 (range, 4-8), and
              median improvement in Functional Rating Index scores was 26\%
              (range, 10\%-50\%) from a baseline of 44\% (range, 35\%-71\%).
              Dizziness was eliminated in 3 out of 4 patients and chronic
              headache symptoms were improved in 3 out of 3 patients. There
              were no adverse events or outcomes. CONCLUSIONS:Intermittent
              cervical traction and manipulation of the thoracic spine seem
              useful for the reduction of pain scores and level of disability
              in patients with mild cervical compressive myelopathy attributed
              to herniated disc. A thorough neurological screening exam is
              recommended prior to mechanical treatment of the cervical spine.",

               and physical examination to help place patients with low back
               pain into 1 of 3 broad categories: nonspecific low back pain,
               back pain potentially associated with radiculopathy or spinal
               stenosis, or back pain potentially associated with another
               specific spinal cause. The history should include assessment of
               psychosocial risk factors, which predict risk for chronic
               disabling back pain (strong recommendation, moderate-quality
               evidence). RECOMMENDATION 2: Clinicians should not routinely
               obtain imaging or other diagnostic tests in patients with
               nonspecific low back pain (strong recommendation,
               moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 3: Clinicians should
               perform diagnostic imaging and testing for patients with low
               back pain when severe or progressive neurologic deficits are
               present or when serious underlying conditions are suspected on
               the basis of history and physical examination (strong
               recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 4:
               Clinicians should evaluate patients with persistent low back
               pain and signs or symptoms of radiculopathy or spinal stenosis
               with magnetic resonance imaging (preferred) or computed
               tomography only if they are potential candidates for surgery or
               epidural steroid injection (for suspected radiculopathy) (strong
               recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 5:
               Clinicians should provide patients with evidence-based
               information on low back pain with regard to their expected
               course, advise patients to remain active, and provide
               information about effective self-care options (strong
               recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 6:
               For patients with low back pain, clinicians should consider the
               use of medications with proven benefits in conjunction with back
               care information and self-care. Clinicians should assess
               severity of baseline pain and functional deficits, potential
               benefits, risks, and relative lack of long-term efficacy and
               safety data before initiating therapy (strong recommendation,

              spontaneously, the optimal treatment option for massive lumbar
              disc herniation (LDH) has not been determined. OBJECTIVE:To
              evaluate the extent of reduction in the size of massive LDH on
              magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the pain relief effect of
              transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) during the
              study period. STUDY DESIGN:Retrospective evaluation.
              SETTING:Hospital and ambulatory pain clinic, Korea. METHODS:After
              Institutional Review Board approval, we conducted a retrospective
              review of 28 patients who underwent at least 2 MRIs during the
              period from January 2012 to December 2014. The size of the
              herniated mass was determined from the ratio of the
              anterior-posterior diameter of the spinal canal (C-value) to the
              maximum anterior-posterior diameter of the herniated disc
              (H-value) on axial MRI (C-H ratio). We also analyzed visual
              analogue scale (VAS) scores at baseline (T0), 2 weeks after the
              first and second TFESI (T1, T2), and at the second follow-up MRI
              (T3). RESULTS:The mean C-value was 18.3 $\pm$ 2.9 mm. The mean
              H-value changed from 10.4 $\pm$ 1.9 mm to 4.5 $\pm$ 2.7 mm, and
              the mean C-H ratio changed from 58 $\pm$ 1.0\% to 24 $\pm$ 1.4\%
              (P < 0.001). Twenty-four of 28 patients demonstrated a reduction
              in the size of the herniation, and the mean reduction rate of the
              C-H ratio was 59\%. In 4 patients, the LDH had not resolved on
              MRI, but the symptoms had diminished to such an extent that
              surgery was not required. The mean VAS score had significantly
              decreased at T1 and showed a continued decrease at the time of
              the last follow-up (P < 0.001). LIMITATIONS:This is a
              retrospective study and only offers data for patients who chose
              not to undergo surgery. In addition, the timing of repeat MRI was
              not standardized. CONCLUSION:The majority of cases of massive LDH
              demonstrated resolution at variable points between 3 and 21
              months. TFESI could provide effective pain relief for patients
              with massive LDH in the interval without severe neurologic
              deterioration.IRB approval: Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital: IRB

               for cardiovascular disease. PURPOSE:The purpose of this review
               was to identify different types of physical training programs
               (aerobic, resistance, or combined), with or without
               counseling/diet modifications, and their impact on physical
               fitness in individuals who have class II and III obesity. DATA
               SOURCES:Medline and Medline In-Process, EMBASE, the Cochrane
               Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of
               Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, LILACS, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus,
               PEDro, and PubMed were searched up to June 2017. STUDY
               SELECTION:This review had the following inclusion criteria: body
               mass index of $\geq$35 kg/m2 and age 18 years or older;
               supervised physical training program; randomized controlled
               trial; physical fitness outcome (muscular strength, muscular
               endurance, cardiovascular endurance, and/or flexibility); in
               English or Portuguese; and available full-text article. DATA
               EXTRACTION:Three reviewers independently extracted data,
               assessed study risk of bias using the Cochrane tool, and
               discussed disagreements until consensus was reached. DATA
               SYNTHESIS:Of the 9460 identified articles, 26 were included and
               8 were used in a meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed
               improvements in walking speed and maximal oxygen uptake but not
               knee extension strength in the intervention groups. The Cochrane
               risk-of-bias score indicated that the majority of the data were
               from randomized controlled trials with a low or unclear risk of
               bias. LIMITATIONS:The large variability of outcomes and
               interventions made comparisons difficult. CONCLUSIONS:A
               combination of aerobic exercise and resistance exercise, in
               addition to diet modifications, may improve cardiovascular and
               muscular endurance in individuals with class II and III obesity.
               However, conclusions must be interpreted with caution because of
               the heterogeneity in interventions and outcome measures among
               the studies and an unclear risk of bias in several studies.",

              an individual with a complicated scenario of de Quervain's
              tenosynovitis. BACKGROUND:The patient was a 61-year-old woman who
              presented with signs and symptoms consistent with de Quervain's
              tenosynovitis of the right hand. Range limitations in all motions
              of the right wrist and first carpometacarpal joint complicated
              her presentation. METHODS AND MEASURES:Physical therapy included
              conventional intervention with superficial heat, ice,
              iontophoresis, and transverse friction massage directed to the
              first dorsal tunnel. Conventional joint mobilization techniques
              addressed the motion limitations of the first carpometacarpal,
              radiocarpal, and midcarpal joints. In addition, MWM techniques
              were utilized to promote pain-free wrist and thumb mobility. The
              specific MWM techniques used with this patient involved active
              movements of the thumb and wrist superimposed on a passive radial
              glide of the proximal row of carpal bones. RESULTS:The described
              treatment regime, which involved conventional physical therapy
              interventions, along with MWM, aided in the complete resolution
              of this patient's impairments and functional limitations.
              CONCLUSION:The combination of conventional physical agents,
              exercise, and manual therapy, and the less conventional MWM
              techniques, proved successful with this patient. MWM involving
              the correction of minutejoint malalignments, coupled with active
              motion of the wrist and first carpometacarpal joints, was an
              effective and efficient adjunct physical therapy intervention.
              Because subtle changes injoint alignment may contribute to
              painful syndromes in the tendon complexes that cross a malaligned
              joint, use of MWM as a treatment technique warrants continued
              research.",

  author    = "Louw, Adriaan and Diener, Ina and Puentedura, Emilio J",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND:Recently a preoperative pain neuroscience education
               (NE) program was developed for lumbar surgery (LS) for
               radiculopathy as a means to decrease postoperative pain and
               disability. This study attempts to determine the short term
               effects, if any, of providing NE before surgery on patient
               outcomes. METHODS:A case series of 10 patients (female = 7)
               received preoperative one-on-one educational session by a
               physical therapist on the neuroscience of pain, accompanied by
               an evidence-based booklet, prior to LS for radiculopathy.
               Post-intervention data was gathered immediately after NE, as
               well as 1, 3 and 6 months following LS. Primary outcome measures
               were Pain Catastrophization Scale (PCS), forward flexion,
               straight leg raise (SLR) and beliefs regarding LS.
               RESULTS:Immediately following NE for LS for radiculopathy, all
               patients had lower PCS scores, with 5 patients exceeding the MDC
               score of 9.1 and 8 of the patients had PCS change scores
               exceeding the MDC by the 1, 3 and 6 month follow ups. Physical
               changes showed that fingertip-to-floor test in 6 patients had
               changes in beyond the MDC of 4.5 cm and 6 patients had changes
               in SLR beyond the MDC of 5.7°. The main finding, however,
               indicated a positive and more realistic shift in expectations
               regarding pain after the impending LS by all patients.
               CONCLUSIONS:The results of the case series suggest that
               immediately after NE, patients scheduled for LS for
               radiculopathy had meaningful detectable changes in pain
               catastrophizing, fingertip-to-floor test, passive SLR and
               positive shifts in their beliefs about LS.",

               muscles about the hip during strengthening exercises is
               important for rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE:To compare the
               electromyographic activity produced by the gluteus medius
               (GMed), tensor fascia latae (TFL), anterior hip flexors (AHF),

               hip abduction (ABD), hip abduction with external rotation
               (ABD-ER), and clamshell (CLAM) exercises. DESIGN:Controlled
               laboratory study. SETTING:Laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER
               PARTICIPANTS:Twenty healthy runners (9 men, 11 women; age =
               25.45 $\pm$ 5.80 years, height = 1.71 $\pm$ 0.07 m, mass = 64.43
               $\pm$ 7.75 kg) participated. INTERVENTION(S):A weight equal to
               5\% body mass was affixed to the ankle for the ABD and ABD-ER
               exercises, and an equivalent load was affixed for the CLAM
               exercise. A pressure biofeedback unit was placed beneath the
               trunk to provide positional feedback. MAIN OUTCOME
               MEASURE(S):Surface electromyography (root mean square normalized
               to maximal voluntary isometric contraction) was recorded over
               the GMed, TFL, AHF, and GMax. RESULTS:Three 1-way,
               repeated-measures analyses of variance indicated differences for
               muscle activity among the ABD (F(3,57) = 25.903, P < .001),
               ABD-ER (F(3,57) = 10.458, P < .001), and CLAM (F(3,57) = 4.640,
               P = .006) exercises. For the ABD exercise, the GMed (70.1 $\pm$
               29.9\%), TFL (54.3 $\pm$ 19.1\%), and AHF (28.2 $\pm$ 21.5\%)
               differed in muscle activity. The GMax (25.3 $\pm$ 24.6\%) was
               less active than the GMed and TFL but was not different from the
               AHF. For the ABD-ER exercise, the TFL (70.9 $\pm$ 17.2\%) was
               more active than the AHF (54.3 $\pm$ 24.8\%), GMed (53.03 $\pm$
               28.4\%), and GMax (31.7 $\pm$ 24.1\%). For the CLAM exercise,
               the AHF (54.2 $\pm$ 25.2\%) was more active than the TFL (34.4
               $\pm$ 20.1\%) and GMed (32.6 $\pm$ 16.9\%) but was not different
               from the GMax (34.2 $\pm$ 24.8\%). CONCLUSIONS:The ABD exercise
               is preferred if targeted activation of the GMed is a goal.
               Activation of the other muscles in the ABD-ER and CLAM exercises
               exceeded that of GMed, which might indicate the exercises are
               less appropriate when the primary goal is the GMed activation
               and strengthening.",

               with the basic principles of the approach to manual therapy
               evaluation and treatment pioneered by Maitland, an Australian
               physical therapist. This approach involves a complete subjective
               examination to determine the severity, irritability, nature, and
               stage of the patient's complaints. In this way, the therapist
               may reach conclusions as to the amount and vigor of the physical
               examination and proceed with treatment in an analytical manner.
               Methodical reassessment is used to justify treatment
               progression. Comprehensive treatment and the rationale for this
               approach are discussed. Though most physical therapists are
               familiar with the straight-leg-raising test as a means of
               assessing low back pain and chronic lumbar nerve root
               irritation, they are often not familiar with other tests that
               examine neural tissues, such as the slump test. The proposed
               anatomical and biomechanical bases for these tests are
               discussed. The patient in this case study was a 50-year-old man
               with a physician's diagnosis of a chronic lumbar nerve root
               irritation. The patient was evaluated and treated in eight
               visits using techniques designed to evaluate neural tissues.
               Reassessment indicated significant symptom reduction, and the
               treatment was modified accordingly. Patient management,
               including home exercises, is discussed.",

              randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of
              arthroscopy for osteoarthritis of the knee. METHODS:A total of
              180 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee were randomly
              assigned to receive arthroscopic d{\'e}bridement, arthroscopic
              lavage, or placebo surgery. Patients in the placebo group
              received skin incisions and underwent a simulated d{\'e}bridement
              without insertion of the arthroscope. Patients and assessors of
              outcome were blinded to the treatment-group assignment. Outcomes
              were assessed at multiple points over a 24-month period with the
              use of five self-reported scores--three on scales for pain and
              two on scales for function--and one objective test of walking and
              stair climbing. A total of 165 patients completed the trial.
              RESULTS:At no point did either of the intervention groups report
              less pain or better function than the placebo group. For example,
              mean (+/-SD) scores on the Knee-Specific Pain Scale (range, 0 to
              100, with higher scores indicating more severe pain) were similar
              in the placebo, lavage, and d{\'e}bridement groups: 48.9+/-21.9,
              54.8+/-19.8, and 51.7+/-22.4, respectively, at one year (P=0.14
              for the comparison between placebo and lavage; P=0.51 for the
              comparison between placebo and d{\'e}bridement) and 51.6+/-23.7,
              53.7+/-23.7, and 51.4+/-23.2, respectively, at two years (P=0.64
              and P=0.96, respectively). Furthermore, the 95 percent confidence
              intervals for the differences between the placebo group and the
              intervention groups exclude any clinically meaningful difference.

              Pain-associated psychological distress adversely influences
              outcomes for patients with musculoskeletal pain. However,
              assessment of pain-associated psychological distress (ie, yellow
              flags) is not routinely performed in orthopaedic physical therapy
              practice. A standardized yellow flag assessment tool will better
              inform treatment decision making related to psychologically
              informed practice. Objectives To describe the development of a
              concise, multidimensional yellow flag assessment tool for
              application in orthopaedic physical therapy clinical practice.
              Methods A 136-item yellow flag item bank was developed from
              validated psychological questionnaires across domains related to
              pain vulnerability (negative mood, fear avoidance) and resilience
              (positive affect/coping). Patients seeking physical therapy with
              neck, back, knee, or shoulder pain completed the item bank.
              Iterative statistical analyses determined minimal item sets
              meeting thresholds for identifying elevated vulnerability or low
              resilience (ie, upper or lower quartile, as indicated). Further
              item reduction yielded a concise yellow flag assessment tool to
              assess 11 psychological constructs measuring pain-associated
              psychological distress. Correlations between the assessment tool
              and individual psychological questionnaires were measured and
              compared between anatomical regions. Concurrent validity was
              assessed by determining variance explained in pain and disability
              scores by the assessment tool. Results Subjects with elevated
              vulnerability and decreased resilience were identified with a
              high degree of accuracy (minimum of 85\%) using a 17-item tool.
              Correlations were moderate to high between the 17-item tool and
              individual psychological questionnaires, with no significant
              differences in correlations between different anatomical regions.
              Shorter 10- and 7-item versions of the assessment tool allow
              clinicians the flexibility to assess for yellow flags quickly
              with acceptable trade-offs in accuracy (81\% and 75\%,
              respectively). All versions of the tool explained significant
              additional variance in pain and disability scores (range,
              19.3\%-36.7\%) after accounting for demographics, historical
              variables, and anatomical region of pain. Conclusion Concise
              assessment of yellow flags is feasible in outpatient physical
              therapy settings. This multidimensional tool advances assessment
              of pain-associated psychological distress through the addition of
              positive affect/coping constructs and estimation of full
              questionnaire scores. Further study is warranted to determine how
              this tool complements established risk-assessment tools by
              providing the option for efficient treatment monitoring. J Orthop

              sometimes not possible. The aim of this study was to understand
              the possible role of the deep fasciae in CNP and the utility of
              the ultrasonography in the diagnosis of myofascial neck pain.
              METHODS:The morphometric and clinical data of 25 healthy subjects
              and 28 patients with CNP were compared. For all subjects, the
              active and passive cervical range of motion (ROM) was analyzed
              and the neck pain disability questionnaire (NDPQ) was
              administered. The fascial thickness of the sternal ending of the
              sternocleidomastoid and medial scalene muscles was also analyzed
              by ultrasonography. RESULTS:There were significant differences
              between healthy subjects and patients with CNP in the thickness
              of the upper side of the sternocleidomastoid fascia and the lower
              and upper sides of the right scalene fascia both at the end of
              treatment as during follow-up. A significant decrease in pain and
              thickness of the fasciae were found. Analysis of the thickness of
              the sub-layers showed a significant decrease in loose connective
              tissue, both at the end of treatment and during follow-up.
              CONCLUSIONS:The data support the hypothesis that the loose
              connective tissue inside the fasciae may plays a significant role
              in the pathogenesis of CNP. In particular, the value of 0.15 cm
              of the SCM fascia was considered as a cut-off value which allows
              the clinician to make a diagnosis of myofascial disease in a
              subject with CNP. The variation of thickness of the fascia
              correlated with the increase in quantity of the loose connective
              tissue but not with dense connective tissue.",

              especially in baseball pitchers, continue to increase in
              frequency. The anterior band of the ulnar collateral ligament
              (UCL), the primary restraint to valgus stress, is commonly
              injured from throwing. Historically, such injuries have been
              treated with surgical reconstruction techniques, using a tendon
              autograft. A recently developed UCL repair procedure with an
              internal brace, utilizing collagen tape, is gaining popularity.
              The primary goal of this surgery is to enhance elbow joint
              stability while the ligament is healing and to allow earlier
              return to sport after UCL reconstruction. The rehabilitation
              program following UCL repair with internal brace progresses
              through a different time frame than after UCL reconstruction. The

              training study for the lower limb detrained for 30-32 wk and
              subsequently retrained for 6 wk. Seven untrained women also
              participated in the 6-wk ``retraining'' phase. In addition, four
              women from each group volunteered to continue training an
              additional 7 wk. The initial 20-wk training program caused an
              increase in maximal dynamic strength, hypertrophy of all three
              major fiber types, and a decrease in the percentage of type IIb
              fibers. Detraining had relatively little effect on fiber
              cross-sectional area but resulted in an increased percentage of
              type IIb fibers with a concomitant decrease in IIa fibers.
              Maximal dynamic strength decreased but not to pretraining levels.
              Retraining for 6 wk resulted in significant increases in the
              cross-sectional areas of both fast fiber types (IIa and IIab +
              IIb) compared with detraining values and a decrease in the
              percentage of type IIb fibers. The 7-wk extension accentuated
              these trends such that cross-sectional areas continued to
              increase (nonsignificant) and no IIb fibers could be found.
              Similar results were found for the nonpreviously trained women.
              These data suggest that rapid muscular adaptations occur as a
              result of strength training in previously trained as well as
              non-previously trained women. Some adaptations (fiber area and
              maximal dynamic strength) may be retained for long periods during
              detraining and may contribute to a rapid return to

               was to investigate the efficacy of motor control exercise for
               people with chronic low back pain. DESIGN:This was a randomized,
               placebo-controlled trial. SETTING:The study was conducted in an
               outpatient physical therapy department in Australia. Patients
               The participants were 154 patients with chronic low back pain of
               more than 12 weeks' duration. INTERVENTION:Twelve sessions of
               motor control exercise (ie, exercises designed to improve
               function of specific muscles of the low back region and the
               control of posture and movement) or placebo (ie, detuned
               ultrasound therapy and detuned short-wave therapy) were
               conducted over 8 weeks. MEASUREMENTS:Primary outcomes were pain
               intensity, activity (measured by the Patient-Specific Functional
               Scale), and patient's global impression of recovery measured at
               2 months. Secondary outcomes were pain; activity (measured by
               the Patient-Specific Functional Scale); patient's global
               impression of recovery measured at 6 and 12 months; activity
               limitation (measured by the Roland-Morris Disability
               Questionnaire) at 2, 6, and 12 months; and risk of persistent or
               recurrent pain at 12 months. RESULTS:The exercise intervention
               improved activity and patient's global impression of recovery
               but did not clearly reduce pain at 2 months. The mean effect of
               exercise on activity (measured by the Patient-Specific
               Functional Scale) was 1.1 points (95\% confidence interval
               [CI]=0.3 to 1.8), the mean effect on global impression of
               recovery was 1.5 points (95\% CI=0.4 to 2.5), and the mean
               effect on pain was 0.9 points (95\% CI=-0.01 to 1.8), all
               measured on 11-point scales. Secondary outcomes also favored
               motor control exercise. Limitation Clinicians could not be
               blinded to the intervention they provided. CONCLUSIONS:Motor
               control exercise produced short-term improvements in global
               impression of recovery and activity, but not pain, for people
               with chronic low back pain. Most of the effects observed in the
               short term were maintained at the 6- and 12-month follow-ups.",

              gold standard for the diagnosis of CGD. The purpose of this case
              series is to describe the clinical decision making utilized in
              the management of 7 patients presenting with CGD. Case
              Description Patients presenting with neck pain and accompanying
              subjective symptoms, including dizziness, unsteadiness,
              light-headedness, and visual disturbance, were selected. Clinical
              evidence of a temporal relationship between neck pain and
              dizziness, with or without sensorimotor disturbances, was
              assessed. Clinical decision making followed a 4-step process,
              informed by the current available best evidence. Outcome measures
              included the numeric rating scale for dizziness and neck pain,
              the Dizziness Handicap Inventory, Patient-Specific Functional
              Scale, and global rating of change. Outcomes Seven patients (mean
              age, 57 years; range, 31-86 years; 7 female) completed physical
              therapy management at an average of 13 sessions (range, 8-30
              sessions) over a mean of 7 weeks. Clinically meaningful
              improvements were observed in the numeric rating scale for
              dizziness (mean difference, 5.7; 95\% confidence interval [CI]:
              4.0, 7.5), neck pain (mean difference, 5.4; 95\% CI: 3.8, 7.1),
              and the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (mean difference, 32.6; 95\%
              CI: 12.9, 52.2) at discontinuation. Patients also demonstrated
              overall satisfaction via the Patient-Specific Functional Scale
              (mean difference, 9) and global rating of change (mean, +6).
              Discussion This case series describes the physical therapist

               fear-avoidance beliefs is uncommon, but elevated levels of fear
               could worsen outcomes. Developing short screening tools might
               reduce the data collection burden and facilitate screening,
               which could prompt further testing or management strategy
               modifications to improve outcomes. OBJECTIVE:The purpose of this
               study was to develop efficient yet accurate screening methods
               for identifying elevated levels of fear-avoidance beliefs
               regarding work or physical activities in people receiving
               outpatient rehabilitation. DESIGN:A secondary analysis of data
               collected prospectively from people with a variety of common
               neuromusculoskeletal diagnoses was conducted. METHODS:Intake
               Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) data were collected
               from 17,804 people who had common neuromusculoskeletal
               conditions and were receiving outpatient rehabilitation in 121
               clinics in 26 states (in the United States). Item response
               theory (IRT) methods were used to analyze the FABQ data, with
               particular emphasis on differential item functioning among
               clinically logical groups of subjects, and to identify screening
               items. The accuracy of screening items for identifying subjects
               with elevated levels of fear was assessed with receiver
               operating characteristic analyses. RESULTS:Three items for fear
               of physical activities and 10 items for fear of work activities
               represented unidimensional scales with adequate IRT model fit.
               Differential item functioning was negligible for variables known
               to affect functional status outcomes: sex, age, symptom acuity,
               surgical history, pain intensity, condition severity, and
               impairment. Items that provided maximum information at the
               median for the FABQ scales were selected as screening items to
               dichotomize subjects by high versus low levels of fear. The
               accuracy of the screening items was supported for both scales.
               LIMITATIONS:This study represents a retrospective analysis,
               which should be replicated using prospective designs. Future
               prospective studies should assess the reliability and validity
               of using one FABQ item to screen people for high levels of
               fear-avoidance beliefs. CONCLUSIONS:The lack of differential
               item functioning in the FABQ scales in the sample tested in this
               study suggested that FABQ screening could be useful in routine
               clinical practice and allowed the development of single-item
               screening for fear-avoidance beliefs that accurately identified
               subjects with elevated levels of fear. Because screening was
               accurate and efficient, single IRT-based FABQ screening items
               are recommended to facilitate improved evaluation and care of
               heterogeneous populations of people receiving outpatient
               rehabilitation.",

              passive behavior of the stretch reflex as a variable stiffness
              spring whose stiffness was proportional to activation, the
              critical muscle stiffness required for mechanical stability was
              calculated. The model demonstrated that the intersegmental
              muscles were the least efficient at laterally stabilizing the
              spine. At any given load, multisegmental muscles were more
              efficient, and their efficiency increased with the number of
              segments spanned. The most efficient muscles were those that
              originated from the pelvis, spanning the maximum number of
              segments. The muscular model was unstable, regardless of the
              muscular stiffness, when any vertebral segment was devoid of
              muscle. Moreover, when the load on the spine is increased,
              buckling can be prevented most efficiently with the pelvic
              muscles and least efficiently with the intersegmental muscles.",

               and 12 months after surgery for cervical degenerative
               radiculopathy on recommended PROMs. STUDY DESIGN:Prospective
               cohort study with 12 months follow-up. PATIENT SAMPLE:Patients
               operated at one or two levels for cervical radiculopathy
               included in the Norwegian Registry for Spine Surgery (NORspine)
               from 2011 to 2016. OUTCOME MEASURES:Neck disability index (NDI),
               Numeric Rating Scale for neck pain (NRS-NP) and arm pain
               (NRS-AP), health-related quality-of-life EuroQol 3L (EQ-5D),
               general health status (EQ-VAS). METHODS:We included 2,868
               consecutive cervical degenerative radiculopathy patients
               operated for cervical radiculopathy in one or two levels and
               included in the Norwegian Registry for Spine Surgery (NORspine).
               External criterion to determine accuracy and optimal cut-off
               values for success in the PROMs was the global perceived effect
               scale. Success was defined as ``much better'' or ``completely
               recovered.'' Cut-off values were assessed by analyzing the area
               under the receiver operating curves for follow-up scores, mean
               change scores, and percentage change scores. RESULTS:All PROMs
               showed high accuracy in defining success and nonsuccess and only
               minor differences were found between 3- and 12-month scores. At
               12 months, the area under the receiver operating curves for
               follow-up scores were 0.86 to 0.91, change scores were 0.74 to
               0.87, and percentage change scores were 0.74 to 0.91. Percentage
               scores of NDI and NRS-AP showed the best accuracy. The optimal
               cut-off values for each PROM showed considerable overlap across
               those operated due to disc herniation and spondylotic foraminal
               stenosis. CONCLUSIONS:All PROMs, especially NDI and NRS-AP,
               showed good to excellent discriminative ability in
               distinguishing between a successful and nonsuccessful outcome
               after surgery due to cervical radiculopathy. Percentage change
               scores are recommended for use in research and clinical

  abstract = "OBJECT:Symptomatic herniated thoracic discs remain a surgical
              challenge and historically have been associated with significant
              complications. While neurological outcomes have improved with the
              abandonment of decompressive laminectomy, the attempt to minimize
              surgical complications and associated morbidities continues
              through less invasive approaches. Many of these techniques, such
              as thoracoscopy, have not been widely adopted due to technical
              difficulties. The current study was performed to examine the
              safety and early results of a minimally invasive lateral approach
              for symptomatic thoracic herniated intervertebral discs.
              METHODS:Sixty patients from 5 institutions were treated using a
              mini-open lateral approach for 75 symptomatic thoracic herniated
              discs with or without calcification. The mean age was 57.9 years
              (range 23-80 years), and 53.3\% of the patients were male.
              Treatment levels ranged from T4-5 to T11-12, with 1-3 levels
              being treated (mean 1.3 levels). The most common levels treated
              were T11-12 (14 cases [18.7\%]), T7-8 (12 cases [16\%]), and T8-9
              (12 cases [16\%]). Symptoms included myelopathy in 70\% of cases,
              radiculopathy in 51.7\%, axial back pain in 76.7\%, and bladder
              and/or bowel dysfunction in 26.7\%. Instrumentation included an
              interbody spacer in all but 6 cases (10\%). Supplemental internal
              fixation included anterolateral plating in 33.3\% of cases and
              pedicle screws in 10\%; there was no supplemental internal
              fixation in 56.7\% of cases. Follow-up ranged from 0.5 to 24
              months (mean 11.0 months). RESULTS:The median operating time,
              estimated blood loss, and length of stay were 182 minutes, 290
              ml, and 5.0 days, respectively. Four major complications occurred
              (6.7\%): pneumonia in 1 patient (1.7\%); extrapleural free air in
              1 patient (1.7\%), treated with chest tube placement; new
              lower-extremity weakness in 1 patient (1.7\%); and wound
              infection in posterior instrumentation in 1 patient (1.7\%).
              Reoperations occurred in 3 cases (5\%): one for posterior
              reexploration, one for infection in posterior instrumentation,
              and one for removal of symptomatic residual disc material. Back
              pain, measured using the visual analog scale, improved 60\% from
              the preoperative score to the last follow-up, that is, from 7.8
              to 3.1. Excellent or good overall outcomes were achieved in 80\%
              of the patients, a fair or unchanged outcome resulted in 15\%,
              and a poor outcome occurred in 5\%. Moreover, myelopathy,
              radiculopathy, axial back pain, and bladder and/or bowel
              dysfunction improved in 83.3\%, 87.0\%, 91.1\%, and 87.5\% of
              cases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:The authors' early experience
              with a large multicenter series suggested that the minimally
              invasive lateral approach is a safe, reproducible, and
              efficacious procedure for achieving adequate decompression in
              thoracic disc herniations in a less invasive manner than
              conventional surgical techniques and without the use of
              endoscopes. Symptom resolution was achieved at similar rates
              using this approach as compared with the most efficacious
              techniques in the literature, and with fewer complications in
              most circumstances.",

              activities of daily living and sports, it hasn't been
              specifically tested by most physical therapists or incorporated
              into rehabilitation programs until late in the treatment process.
              Little evidence is available on quadriceps torque development
              capacity before and after arthroscopic knee surgery. Objectives
              To study knee extensor rate of torque development, contributing
              mechanisms, and associations with strength and patient-reported
              outcomes before and during the first 6 weeks after arthroscopic
              partial meniscectomy. Methods Twenty subjects (mean $\pm$ SD age,
              42.3 $\pm$ 13.7 years; body mass index, 26.6 $\pm$ 3.1 kg/m2)
              were tested before surgery, and at 2 and 5 weeks after surgery.
              Quadriceps muscle volume, strength, activation, rate of torque
              development, and patient-reported outcomes were evaluated across
              the study period. Results Significant side-to-side differences in
              quadriceps strength and voluntary rate of torque development were
              observed at each time point (P<.05). Changes in muscle activity
              were associated with changes in rapid torque development
              capacity. Side-to-side rate of torque development deficits after
              surgery were associated with lower patient-reported outcomes
              scores. Conclusion Diminished rapid torque development capacity
              is common in arthroscopic meniscal debridement patients. This
              reduced capacity is associated with an inability to quickly
              recruit and drive the quadriceps muscles (neural mechanisms) and
              not muscle atrophy or other peripheral factors tested.
              Patient-reported outcomes are associated with quadriceps rate of
              torque development, but not strength or muscle size. Rapid torque
              development warrants greater attention in rehabilitation. J

  abstract  = "Background:People with diabetes are at high risk for shoulder
               pain, limited joint mobility, and adhesive capsulitis.
               Objective:The objective of this study was to evaluate the
               effects of a shoulder movement intervention (ShoMo) compared to
               a wellness intervention on the primary outcomes of active
               shoulder flexion and reported Shoulder Pain and Disability Index
               (SPADI) measured after intervention and 9 months later.
               Design:The design was a prospective, randomized, controlled
               clinical trial. Setting:The setting was a research center at an
               academic medical center. Participants:Fifty-two participants
               with type 2 diabetes and shoulder pain or limited motion were
               randomized to a group receiving ShoMo (N = 27; mean age = 59.3;
               SD = 7.0) or a group receiving wellness activities (N = 25; mean
               age = 57.9; SD = 7.7). Intervention:The ShoMo group received
               instruction in a progressive, active shoulder movement program.
               The wellness group received instruction in diabetes management.
               Measurements:Measurements were made at baseline, after 3 months
               of intervention, and at 6, 9, and 12 months after baseline.
               Results:After intervention, the ShoMo group had a 7.2-degree
               increase in active shoulder flexion compared with the wellness
               group (95\% CI = 0.9-13.5°), but there was no difference at
               subsequent follow-ups. The ShoMo group showed a 12.7-point
               improvement in the SPADI score compared to the wellness group
               after intervention (95\% CI = 1.1-24.3), which remained better
               than the wellness group 9 months later. Limitations:The number
               of participants and duration of follow-up were inadequate to
               determine if intervention can help to prevent future severe
               shoulder problems. Conclusions:A progressive shoulder movement
               program can have meaningful effects on active motion and
               symptoms in people with type 2 diabetes and mild-to-moderate

              in superior outcomes to advice alone in participants with
              low-back disorders. METHODS:This prospective parallel group
              multicentre randomised controlled trial was set in 16 primary
              care physiotherapy practices in Melbourne, Australia. Random
              assignment resulted in 156 participants receiving 10 sessions of
              physiotherapy that was individualised based on pathoanatomical,
              psychosocial and neurophysiological barriers to recovery combined
              with guideline-based advice, and 144 participants receiving 2
              sessions of physiotherapist-delivered advice alone. Primary
              outcomes were activity limitation (Oswestry Disability Index) and
              numerical rating scales for back and leg pain at 5, 10, 26 and 52
              weeks postbaseline. Analyses were by intention-to-treat using
              linear mixed models. RESULTS:Between-group differences showed
              significant effects favouring individualised physiotherapy for
              back and leg pain at 10 weeks (back: 1.3, 95\% CI 0.8 to 1.8;
              leg: 1.1, 95\% CI 0.5 to 1.7) and 26 weeks (back: 0.9, 95\% CI
              0.4 to 1.4; leg: 1.0, 95\% CI 0.4 to 1.6). Oswestry favoured
              individualised physiotherapy at 10 weeks (4.7; 95\% CI 2.0 to
              7.5), 26 weeks (5.4; 95\% CI 2.6 to 8.2) and 52 weeks (4.3; 95\%
              CI 1.4 to 7.1). Responder analysis at 52 weeks showed
              participants receiving individualised physiotherapy were more
              likely to improve by a clinically important amount of 50\% from
              baseline for Oswestry (relative risk (RR=1.3) 1.5; 95\% CI 1.2 to
              1.8) and back pain (RR 1.3; 95\% CI 1.2 to 1.8) than participants
              receiving advice alone. CONCLUSIONS:10 sessions of individualised
              physiotherapy was more effective than 2 sessions of advice alone
              in participants with low-back disorders of $\geq$6 weeks and
              $\leq$6 months duration. Between-group changes were sustained at
              12 months for activity limitation and 6 months for back and leg

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE:To assess the reliability of the physical examination
              of the hip in osteoarthritis (OA) among rheumatologists and
              orthopedic surgeons, and to evaluate the benefits of
              standardization. METHODS:Thirty-five physical signs and
              techniques were evaluated using a 6 x 6 Latin square design.
              Subjects with mild to severe hip OA, based on physical and
              radiographic signs, were examined in random order prior to and
              following standardization of physical examination techniques. For
              dichotomous signs, agreement was calculated as the
              prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK), whereas for
              continuous and ordinal signs a reliability coefficient was
              calculated using analysis of variance. A PABAK >0.60 and a
              reliability coefficient >0.80 were considered to indicate
              adequate reliability. RESULTS:Adequate post-standardization
              reliability was achieved for 25 (71\%) of 35 signs. The most
              highly reliable signs included true and apparent leg length
              discrepancy > or =1.5 cm; hip flexion, abduction, adduction, and
              extension strength; log roll test for hip pain; internal rotation
              and flexion range of motion; and Thomas test for flexion
              contracture. The standardization process was associated with
              substantial improvements in reliability for a number of physical
              signs, although minimal or no change was noted for some. Only 1
              sign, Trendelenburg's sign, was highly unreliable
              post-standardization. CONCLUSION:With the exception of gait, a
              comprehensive hip examination can be performed with adequate
              reliability. Post-standardization reliability is improved
              compared with pre-standardization reliability for some physical
              signs. The application of these findings to future OA studies
              will contribute to improved outcome assessments in OA.",

  abstract  = "Background:Available evidence favors the use of pain
               neuroscience education (PNE) in patients with chronic pain.
               However, PNE trials are often limited to small sample sizes and,
               despite the current digital era, the effects of blended-learning
               PNE (ie, the combination of online digital media with
               traditional educational methods) have not yet been investigated.
               Objective:The study objective was to examine whether
               blended-learning PNE is able to improve disability,
               catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, and illness perceptions.
               Design:This study was a 2-center, triple-blind randomized
               controlled trial (participants, statistician, and outcome
               assessor were masked). Setting:The study took place at
               university hospitals in Ghent and Brussels, Belgium.
               Participants:Participants were 120 people with nonspecific
               chronic spinal pain (ie, chronic neck pain and low back pain).
               Intervention:The intervention was 3 sessions of PNE or
               biomedically focused back/neck school education (addressing
               spinal anatomy and physiology). Measurements:Measurements were
               self-report questionnaires (Pain Disability Index, Pain
               Catastrophizing Scale, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, Illness
               Perception Questionnaire, and Pain Vigilance and Awareness
               Questionnaire). Results:None of the treatment groups showed a
               significant change in the perceived disability (Pain Disability
               Index) due to pain (mean group difference posteducation: 1.84;
               95\% CI = -2.80 to 6.47). Significant interaction effects were
               seen for kinesiophobia and several subscales of the Illness
               Perception Questionnaire, including negative consequences,
               cyclical time line, and acute/chronic time line. In-depth
               analysis revealed that only in the PNE group were these outcomes
               significantly improved (9\% to 17\% improvement; 0.37 $\leq$
               Cohen d $\geq$ 0.86). Limitations:Effect sizes are small to
               moderate, which might raise the concern of limited clinical
               utility; however, changes in kinesiophobia exceed the minimal
               detectable difference. PNE should not be used as the sole
               treatment modality but should be combined with other treatment
               strategies. Conclusions:Blended-learning PNE was able to improve
               kinesiophobia and illness perceptions in participants with
               chronic spinal pain. As effect sizes remained small to medium,
               PNE should not be used as a sole treatment but rather should be
               used as a key element within a comprehensive active
               rehabilitation program. Future studies should compare the
               effects of blended-learning PNE with offline PNE and should
               consider cost-effectiveness.",

               outcome measure was developed to evaluate disability and
               symptoms in single or multiple disorders of the upper limb at
               one point or at many points in time. PURPOSE:The purpose of this
               study was to evaluate the reliability, validity, and
               responsiveness of the DASH in a group of diverse patients and to
               compare the results with those obtained with joint-specific
               measures. METHODS:Two hundred patients with either wrist/hand or
               shoulder problems were evaluated by use of questionnaires before
               treatment, and 172 (86\%) were re-evaluated 12 weeks after
               treatment. Eighty-six patients also completed a test-retest
               questionnaire three to five days after the initial (baseline)
               evaluation. The questionnaire package included the DASH, the
               Brigham (carpal tunnel) questionnaire, the SPADI (Shoulder Pain
               and Disability Index), and other markers of pain and function.
               Correlations or t-tests between the DASH and the other measures
               were used to assess construct validity. Test-retest reliability
               was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient and
               other summary statistics. Responsiveness was described using
               standardized response means, receiver operating characteristics
               curves, and correlations between change in DASH score and change
               in scores of other measures. Standard response means were used
               to compare DASH responsiveness with that of the Brigham
               questionnaire and the SPADI in each region. RESULTS:The DASH was
               found to correlate with other measures (r > 0.69) and to
               discriminate well, for example, between patients who were
               working and those who were not (p<0.0001). Test-retest
               reliability (ICC = 0.96) exceeded guidelines. The responsiveness
               of the DASH (to self-rated or expected change) was comparable
               with or better than that of the joint-specific measures in the
               whole group and in each region. CONCLUSIONS:Evidence was
               provided of the validity, test-retest reliability, and
               responsiveness of the DASH. This study also demonstrated that
               the DASH had validity and responsiveness in both proximal and
               distal disorders, confirming its usefulness across the whole
               extremity.",

              maximus, vastus medialis, and gastrocnemius) were collected on 11
              highly skilled baseball pitchers and compared with individual
              maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) data. The pitching
              motion was divided into 4 distinct phases: phase 1, initiation of
              pitching motion to maximum stride leg knee height; phase 2,
              maximum stride leg knee height to stride foot contact (SFC);
              phase 3, SFC to ball release; and phase 4, ball release to 0.5
              seconds after ball release (follow-through). Results indicated
              that trail leg musculature elicited moderate to high activity

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:Quadriceps strengthening, quadriceps
              stretching and patellar taping are commonly prescribed together
              for patellofemoral pain patients. This study aimed to examine the
              effectiveness of each of these techniques in isolation for one
              week and in combination for one week. METHODS:A prospective
              double-blind randomized control study was designed involving 41
              subjects with 60 knees diagnosed with patellofemoral pain. The
              knees were randomized in onto one of four groups (n = 15):
              infrapatellar taping, quadriceps strengthening, quadriceps
              stretching and control. The taping was worn continually for the
              week; the strengthening group followed a programme of
              non-weight-bearing terminal range quadriceps exercises, the
              stretching group performed rectus femoris stretches. The control
              group did not receive treatment. All subjects received advice.
              Seven pre- and post-treatment measures included isokinetic
              quadriceps strength, quadriceps length, pain measured during four
              activities and maximum eccentric, posturally controlled,
              pain-free knee flexion angle during a step-down. Results showed
              significant changes over time (p < 0.01) in two out of seven
              measures for the taping group, in five out of seven for the
              strengthening group and five out of seven for the stretching
              group and none in the control group. When the three modalities
              were combined for one week, (n = 60) all seven measures improved
              significantly (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION:In isolation, quadriceps
              stretching and quadriceps strengthening resulted in more
              improvements than taping. Combining these treatments is
              recommended as the initial approach to treating patellofemoral
              pain but further individualized more functional, global treatment

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:The primary purpose of this study was to
               develop a clinical prediction rule (CPR) for identifying
               patients with knee pain and clinical evidence of knee
               osteoarthritis (OA) with favorable short-term response to hip
               mobilizations. The secondary purpose was to determine the
               predictive validity of individual clinical tests for identifying
               these same patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS:Sixty subjects with
               knee OA, aged 51 to 79 years, completed self-report
               questionnaires, a clinical examination of the hip and knee, and
               functional tests and were treated with 4 hip mobilizations.
               Follow-up testing was completed 2 days later. The reference
               criterion for determining a favorable response was either (1) a
               decrease of at least 30\% on composite Numerical Pain Rating
               Scale score obtained during functional tests or (2) a Global
               Rating of Change Scale score of at least 3. RESULTS:The CPR
               developed in this study comprised 5 variables: (1) hip or groin
               pain or paresthesia, (2) anterior thigh pain, (3) passive knee
               flexion less than 122 degrees, (4) passive hip medial (internal)
               rotation less than 17 degrees, and (5) pain with hip
               distraction. Based on the pretest probability of success (68\%),
               the presence of one variable had a positive likelihood ratio of
               5.1 and increased the probability of a successful response to
               92\% at 48-hour follow-up. If 2 variables were present, the
               positive likelihood ratio was 12.9 and the probability of
               success increased to 97\%. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION:The results
               suggest that the CPR developed in this study could improve
               clinicians' decision making and efficiency in examining and
               treating patients with knee OA.",

               acetabular labrum in asymptomatic hips by means of magnetic
               resonance (MR) imaging and to correlate such abnormalities with
               age and the portion of the labrum. MATERIALS AND METHODS:MR
               imaging was performed in 71 asymptomatic hips that were radially
               sectioned perpendicular to the acetabular labrum at 30 degrees
               intervals. RESULTS:The shape of the labrum was triangular in
               80\% (304 of 382) of the labral segments, round in 13\% (49 of
               382), irregular in 7\% (27 of 382), and not identified in 1\%
               (two of 382). A homogeneous low signal intensity was observed in
               56\% (212 of 382). The frequencies of labral irregularity or its
               absence and of high signal intensity increased both with subject
               age and with a more anterior anatomic labral location.
               CONCLUSION:In asymptomatic hips, abnormal findings regarding the
               shape and signal intensity of the acetabular labrum can be
               detected by means of MR imaging. The fact that the findings vary

               musculoskeletal pain and injury of the lower limb. The clinical
               efficacy, mechanical effects, and underlying mechanism of the
               action of foot orthotics has not been conclusively determined
               making it difficult for practitioners to agree on a reliable and
               valid clinical approach to their application and indeed even
               their fabrication. This problem is compounded by evidence
               suggesting that the most commonly used approach for orthotic
               prescription, the (Biomechanical Evaluation of the Foot. Vol. 1.
               Clinical Biomechanics Corporation, Los Angeles, 1971) approach,
               has poor validity and many of the associated clinical
               measurements of that approach lack adequate levels of
               reliability. This paper proposes a new approach that is based on
               two key elements. One is the identification, verification and
               quantification of physical tasks that serve as client specific
               outcome measures. The second is the application of specific
               physical manipulations during the performance of these physical
               tasks. The physical manipulations are selected on the basis of
               motion dysfunction and their immediate effects on the client
               specific outcome measures serve as the basis to making an
               informed decision on the propriety of using orthotics in
               individual clients. The motion dysfunction also guides the type
               of orthotic that is applied. Practical case examples as well as
               generic and specific guidelines to the application of this
               clinical assessment process and orthotics are provided in this

              specificity of the 10 g monofilament with other methodologies.
              Fifty-two individuals with either a current foot ulcer, a history
              of a foot ulcer or the presence of Charcot neuroarthopathy and 51
              individuals with no history of any of these conditions were
              assessed with the 10 g monofilament at four sites on each foot,
              the 128 Hz tuning fork at the halluces, the Biothesiometer at the
              halluces and the modified neuropathy disability score.
              Sensitivities and specificities were calculated for the various
              modalities. The Biothesiometer and the neuropathy disability
              score had the highest sensitivities (0.92 for both). The 128 Hz
              tuning fork tested only at the halluces (criterion: >or=1

              The Biothesiometer and the modified neuropathy disability score
              tend to be more sensitive than the 10 g monofilament for the
              assessment of individuals at risk for foot ulcers. The 128 Hz

               identify the incidence of medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS)
               in a group of high school cross-country runners and to determine
               if a relationship exists between lower extremity structural
               measures and the incidence of MTSS. BACKGROUND: Medial tibial
               stress syndrome is an overuse injury that occurs in
               long-distance runners. Literature exists that implicates
               structural deformity as a contributor to MTSS, but no studies
               have developed a predictive model. METHODS AND MEASURES: We
               measured 125 high school cross-country runners for tibiofibular
               varum, resting calcaneal position during stance, and
               gastrocnemius length. Runners developing MTSS over an 8-week
               period were placed in the injured group (2 men, 13 women; age
               15.3 years 1.0), and 21 randomly selected uninjured runners were
               placed in the uninjured group (13 men, 8 women; age 15.7 years
               +/-1.5). Navicular drop was measured for runners in both groups.
               Reliability of measures was determined using an intraclass
               correlation coefficient (ICC 3,1). Paired t tests were used to
               compare the injury and noninjury groups. A logistic regression
               analysis was used to establish if the descriptive data could
               accurately predict the development of MTSS. RESULTS: Paired t
               tests showed a significant difference in navicular drop test
               measures between the injured (6.8 mm 3.7) and noninjured (3.6 mm
               3.3) groups. Logistic regression analysis revealed navicular
               drop test measurements and sex correctly identified athletes who
               developed MTSS with 76\% accuracy. CONCLUSION: Our study
               supported the hypothesis that a pronatory foot type is related
               to MTSS. The combination of sex and navicular drop test measures
               provides an accurate prediction for the development of MTSS.
               Clinical measures that identify biomechanical risk factors for
               MTSS may allow prevention or early intervention.",

              according to the existing literature, oftentimes associated with
              various forms of psychopathology, including borderline
              personality disorder. Since 1994, eight studies have explored the
              relationship between chronic pain syndromes and borderline
              personality disorder. In averaging the prevalence rates in these
              studies, 30 percent of participants with chronic pain harbor this
              Axis II disorder. Related studies suggest that individuals with
              borderline personality disorder report higher levels of pain than
              those without this personality dysfunction; older, rather than
              younger, patients with borderline personality disorder are more
              likely to have higher pain levels; patients with borderline
              personality disorder in remission use significantly less pain
              medications; medical disability status in chronic pain does not
              necessarily differ between those with versus without borderline
              personality disorder; and the first-degree relatives of
              individuals with borderline personality disorder demonstrate
              statistical coaggregation with somatoform pain disorder. Why
              might chronic pain demonstrate associations with borderline
              personality disorder? Perhaps chronic pain is simply another
              manifestation of the inability of individuals with borderline
              personality disorder to self-regulate (i.e., the inability to
              regulate pain). In addition, pain symptoms may function as an
              interpersonal means of eliciting caring responses from others.
              Regardless, the assessment and treatment implications of these
              comorbid patients suggest a challenging scenario for both mental

               models. This Perspective describes how the value proposition of
               early physical therapy can be improved by redefining harm,
               embracing a prognostic approach to clinical decision making, and
               advocating for system-wide guideline-adherent pain care. It also
               outlines the need to adopt a common language to describe these
               models and embrace new, rigorous study designs and analytical
               approaches to better understand where and how early physical
               therapy delivers value. The goal is to define a clear path
               forward to ensure physical therapists are aligned within health
               care systems to deliver on the American Physical Therapy
               Association's vision of high-value care in a rapidly changing

  abstract = "A detailed history alone may lead to a specific diagnosis in
              approximately 70 percent of patients who have wrist pain.
              Patients who present with spontaneous onset of wrist pain, who
              have a vague or distant history of trauma, or whose activities
              consist of repetitive loading could be suffering from a carpal
              bone nonunion or from avascular necrosis. The hand and wrist can
              be palpated to localize tenderness to a specific anatomic
              structure. Special tests can help support specific diagnoses
              (e.g., Finkelstein's test, the grind test, the lunotriquetral
              shear test, McMurray's test, the supination lift test, Watson's
              test). When radiography is indicated, the posterior-anterior and
              lateral views are essential to evaluate the bony architecture and
              alignment, the width and symmetry of the joint spaces, and the
              soft tissues. When the diagnosis remains unclear, or when the
              clinical course does not improve with conservative measures,
              further imaging modalities are indicated, including
              ultrasonography, technetium bone scan, computed tomography, and
              magnetic resonance imaging. If all studies are negative and
              clinically significant wrist pain continues, the patient may need

              sport athletes. DESIGN:Prospective cohort study. METHODS:A
              2-dimensional video analysis was used to measure the frontal
              plane knee projection angle in the single-leg vertical drop jump
              (VDJ) and the bilateral VDJ in young team sport athletes. Out of
              the 364 athletes (187 male, 177 female), 189 played basketball
              and 175 played floorball. RESULTS:Six male athletes sustained
              knee injuries and 23 sustained ankle injuries. Frontal plane knee
              projection angle in the single-leg VDJ or the bilateral VDJ was
              not associated with ankle injuries among male athletes. No

               of lumbar stenosis with radiculopathy and lower extremity
               arthritis may lead to diagnostic uncertainty. PURPOSE:To
               describe the findings of hip spine syndrome, a constellation of
               symptoms with extensive overlap of radiculopathy and lower
               extremity arthritis. CONCLUSIONS:Evaluation of the patient with
               lower extremity pain in consideration for total joint
               arthroplasty should include functional inquiry of the spinal
               nerves. Diagnostic tests and injections may allow an informative
               weighting of the patient's symptoms, leading to a better
               understanding of the patient's pain syndrome. There is a group
               of patients who have a total hip arthroplasty and then develop
               or may continue to have pain of groin and buttock, secondary to
               sciatica of lumbar spinal stenosis. For the patient undergoing
               total hip arthroplasty with asymptomatic spinal stenosis, there
               may be increased neurological risk at surgery, related to the
               stenosis. The patient with both conditions may require surgical
               decompression of the lumbar stenosis as well as joint

              persistent symptom in cancer survivors. Clear guidelines for both
              the diagnosis and treatment of pain in cancer survivors are
              lacking. Classification of pain is important as it may facilitate
              more specific targeting of treatment. In this paper we present an
              overview of nociceptive, neuropathic and central sensitization
              pain following cancer treatment, as well as the rationale,
              criteria and process for stratifying pain classification.
              MATERIAL AND METHODS:Recently, a clinical method for classifying
              any pain as either predominant central sensitization pain,
              neuropathic or nociceptive pain was developed, based on a large
              body of research evidence and international expert opinion. We, a
              team of 15 authors from 13 different centers, four countries and
              two continents have applied this classification algorithm to the
              cancer survivor population. RESULTS:The classification of pain
              following cancer treatment entails two steps: (1) examining the
              presence of neuropathic pain; and (2) using an algorithm for
              differentiating predominant nociceptive and central sensitization
              pain. Step 1 builds on the established criteria for neuropathic
              pain diagnosis, while Step 2 applies a recently developed
              clinical method for classifying any pain as either predominant
              central sensitization pain, neuropathic or nociceptive pain to
              the cancer survivor population. CONCLUSION:The classification
              criteria allow identifying central sensitization pain following
              cancer treatment. The recognition of central sensitization pain
              in practice is an important development in the integration of
              pain neuroscience into the clinic, and one that is relevant for
              people undergoing and following cancer treatment.",

               conventional treatments. Graded motor imagery is effective for a
               small subset of patients with CRPS1. OBJECTIVE:To investigate
               whether graded motor imagery would reduce pain and disability
               for a more general CRPS1 population and for people with phantom
               limb pain. METHODS:Fifty-one patients with phantom limb pain or
               CRPS1 were randomly allocated to motor imagery, consisting of 2
               weeks each of limb laterality recognition, imagined movements,
               and mirror movements, or to physical therapy and ongoing medical
               care. RESULTS:There was a main statistical effect of treatment
               group, but not diagnostic group, on pain and function. The mean
               (95\% CI) decrease in pain between pre- and post-treatment (100
               mm visual analogue scale) was 23.4 mm (16.2 to 30.4 mm) for the
               motor imagery group and 10.5 mm (1.9 to 19.2 mm) for the control
               group. Improvement in function was similar and gains were
               maintained at 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSION:Motor imagery
               reduced pain and disability in these patients with complex
               regional pain syndrome type I or phantom limb pain, but the
               mechanism, or mechanisms, of the effect are not clear.",

               Readmission Rates: Preliminary Study",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND:Providing patients with optimal discharge disposition
               and follow-up services could prevent unplanned readmissions.
               Despite their qualifications, physical therapists are rarely
               represented on the interdisciplinary team. OBJECTIVE:This study
               aimed to determine the relationship between the participation of
               physical therapists in interdisciplinary discharge rounds and
               readmission rates. METHODS:In this retrospective observational
               study, patients discharged by 2 interdisciplinary teams with or
               without a physical therapist's participation were followed for 5
               months. Adherence to the physical therapist's recommendations
               for follow-up services and unplanned 30-day readmissions were
               tracked. Multiple logistic regression and random forest models
               were used to determine factors contributing to 30-day
               readmission rates. RESULTS:The odds of 30-day readmissions were
               3.78 times greater when a physical therapist was absent from the
               interdisciplinary team compared with the odds of 30-day
               readmissions when a physical therapist participated in the
               interdisciplinary team. In addition, the odds of 30-day
               readmission for patients discharged to their home were 2.47
               times greater than those who were not discharged to their home.
               An increased lack of postdischarge services was noted when a
               physical therapist was not included in the interdisciplinary
               team. LIMITATIONS:The nonrandom selection of patients into
               groups, the small sample size, and the inability to adjust risk
               for unknown factors (eg, medical diagnoses, comorbidities,
               funding, and functional measures) limited interpretation of the
               results. CONCLUSION:Significantly higher readmission rates were
               noted for patients whose interdisciplinary team did not have a
               physical therapist and for those patients who were discharged to
               their home. These preliminary findings suggest that discharge
               from the acute care setting is an elaborate process and should
               be designed carefully. In order to identify the optimal
               discharge process, future research should account for patient
               complexities in addition to the composition of the
               interdisciplinary discharge team.",

              be important in the assessment of individuals with neck pain.
              However, the large variety of sensorimotor control tests used in
              varying populations makes it difficult to draw conclusions about
              their clinical value. We aimed to compare cervical sensorimotor
              control outcomes between individuals with chronic idiopathic neck
              pain and asymptomatic individuals using a battery of recommended
              tests, and to investigate the correlation between cervical
              sensorimotor control outcomes and pain intensity and neck
              disability. DESIGN:Case-control study. METHODS:Fifty participants
              with chronic idiopathic neck pain and 50 age- and sex-matched
              asymptomatic controls completed 7 cervical sensorimotor control
              tests: joint position error (including joint position error
              torsion), postural balance, subjective visual vertical, head-tilt
              response, ``the Fly,'' smooth pursuit neck torsion, and head
              steadiness. Between-group differences were investigated with the
              Mann-Whitney U test. Correlations between tests and levels of
              neck pain and disability were investigated using the Spearman
              rho. RESULTS:There were no differences in cervical sensorimotor
              outcomes between participants with chronic idiopathic neck pain
              and asymptomatic controls for any test (P = .203-.981). For each
              test, ``poor performers'' consisted of both individuals with and
              without neck pain. Correlations were weak between tests and
              levels of neck pain (r = 0.010-0.294) and neck disability (r =
              0.007-0.316). CONCLUSION:These findings suggest that sensorimotor

              therapy to exercise therapy in sick-listed patients with chronic
              low back pain (>8 wks). SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND DATA: The effect
              of exercise therapy and manual therapy on chronic low back pain
              with respect to pain, function, and sick leave have been
              investigated in a number of studies. The results are, however,
              conflicting. METHODS: Patients with chronic low back pain or
              radicular pain sick-listed for more than 8 weeks and less than 6
              months were included. A total of 49 patients were randomized to
              either manual therapy (n = 27) or to exercise therapy (n = 22).
              Sixteen treatments were given over the course of 2 months. Pain
              intensity, functional disability (Oswestry disability index),
              general health (Dartmouth COOP function charts), and return to
              work were recorded before, immediately after, at 4 weeks, 6
              months, and 12 months after the treatment period. Spinal range of
              motion (Schober test) was measured before and immediately after
              the treatment period only. RESULTS: Although significant
              improvements were observed in both groups, the manual therapy
              group showed significantly larger improvements than the exercise
              therapy group on all outcome variables throughout the entire
              experimental period. Immediately after the 2-month treatment
              period, 67\% in the manual therapy and 27\% in the exercise
              therapy group had returned to work (P < 0.01), a relative
              difference that was maintained throughout the follow-up period.
              CONCLUSIONS: Improvements were found in both intervention groups,
              but manual therapy showed significantly greater improvement than
              exercise therapy in patients with chronic low back pain. The
              effects were reflected on all outcome measures, both on short and

              of limiting exposure of the central nervous system (CNS) to
              damaging molecules and cells. Dysfunction of the BBB is critical
              in a broad range of CNS disorders including neurodegeneration,
              inflammatory or traumatic injury to the CNS, and stroke. In
              peripheral tissues, the vascular-tissue permeability is normally
              greater than BBB permeability, but vascular leakage can be
              induced by efferent discharge activity in primary sensory neurons
              leading to plasma extravasation into the extravascular space.
              Whether discharge activity of sensory afferents entering the CNS
              may open the BBB or blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) remains an
              open question. RESULTS:Here we show that peripheral nerve injury
              (PNI) produced by either sciatic nerve constriction or
              transecting two of its main branches causes an increase in BSCB
              permeability, as assessed by using Evans Blue dye or horseradish
              peroxidase. The increase in BSCB permeability was not observed 6
              hours after the PNI but was apparent 24 hours after the injury.
              The increase in BSCB permeability was transient, peaking about
              24-48 hrs after PNI with BSCB integrity returning to normal
              levels by 7 days. The increase in BSCB permeability was prevented
              by administering the local anaesthetic lidocaine at the site of
              the nerve injury. BSCB permeability was also increased 24 hours
              after electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve at intensity
              sufficient to activate C-fibers, but not when A-fibers only were
              activated. Likewise, BSCB permeability increased following
              application of capsaicin to the nerve. The increase in
              permeability caused by C-fiber stimulation or by PNI was not
              anatomically limited to the site of central termination of
              primary afferents from the sciatic nerve in the lumbar cord, but
              rather extended throughout the spinal cord and into the brain.
              CONCLUSIONS:We have discovered that injury to a peripheral nerve
              and electrical stimulation of C-fibers each cause an increase in
              the permeability of the BSCB and the BBB. The increase in
              permeability is delayed in onset, peaks at about 24 hours and is
              dependent upon action potential propagation. As the increase is
              mimicked by applying capsaicin to the nerve, the most
              parsimonious explanation for our findings is that the increase in
              permeability is mediated by activation of TRPV1-expressing
              primary sensory neurons. Our findings may be relevant to the
              development of pain and neuroplastic changes in the CNS following
              nerve injury. In addition, our findings may provide the basis for
              developing methods to purposefully open the BBB when needed to
              increase brain penetration of therapeutic agents that might
              normally be excluded by an intact BBB.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND:Low back pain (LBP) is a very common and disabling
               disorder in modern society. The intervention strategies for LBP
               include drug therapy, surgery, and physical interventions.
               Recently, kinesiotaping, as a simple and noninvasive treatment,
               has been used to treat chronic nonspecific LBP, but its
               effectiveness and true merit remains unclear. PURPOSE:The
               purpose of this study was to summarize the results of randomized
               controlled trials (RCTs) on the effectiveness of kinesiotaping
               (KT) for chronic nonspecific low back pain (CNLBP) and
               disability. DATA SOURCES:Medline, Cochrane Library, Google
               Scholar, Web of Science, and EmBase were searched from inception
               to September 1, 2018. STUDY SELECTION:Studies were included in
               the review if they met the following criteria: RCTs published in
               English; patients (>18 years old) diagnosed with CNLBP (pain
               duration of > 12 weeks), with or without leg pain; KT as a
               single treatment or as a part of other forms of physical
               therapy; outcomes measured included pain intensity and
               disability. DATA EXTRACTION:Three independent investigators
               completed data extraction. Methodological quality was appraised
               using the Cochrane tool for assessing the risk of bias. The
               GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and
               Evaluation) guidelines were applied to assess the confidence of
               the effect estimates. DATA SYNTHESIS:Eleven RCT studies
               involving 785 patients were retained for the
               meta-analysis.Standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95\% CIs
               were calculated using a random-effects model. Compared with the
               control group， the pooled SMD of pain intensity was
               significantly reduced (SMD = -0.73; 95\% CI = -1.12 to -0.35;
               GRADE: low) and disability was improved (SMD = -0.51; 95\% CI =
               -0.85 to -0.17; GRADE: low) in the KT group. Subgroup analyses
               showed that, compared with the control, the I strip of KT
               significantly reduced pain (SMD = -0.48; GRADE: low) but not
               disability (SMD = -0.26; GRADE: low). Compared with sham/placebo
               tape, KT provided significant pain reduction (SMD = -0.84;
               GRADE: low) and disability improvement (SMD = -0.56; GRADE:
               low). Moreover, compared with the no-tape group, the KT group
               also showed pain reduction (SMD = -0.74; GRADE: low) and
               disability improvement (SMD = -0.65; GRADE: low).
               LIMITATIONS:Limitations of the review included a lack of
               homogeneity, different methodologies and treatment duration of
               KT application, and relatively small sample sizes.
               CONCLUSIONS:There is low-quality evidence that KT has a
               beneficial role in pain reduction and disability improvement for
               patients with CNLBP. More high-quality studies are required to
               confirm the effects of KT on CNLBP.",

  author    = "Henry, K D and Rosemond, C and Eckert, L B",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:There is limited research on the effects
               of the number of exercises a person is told to perform on
               compliance and performance, as defined by cueing requirements,
               correct alignment, and quality of movement. Some studies of
               medication suggest that compliance decreases as the number of
               medications increases. The purpose of this study was to
               determine whether older adults comply and perform better (ie,
               requiring less cueing, exhibiting correct alignment, and
               exhibiting controlled, coordinated, and continuous movements)
               when they are asked to do 2, 5, or 8 exercises.
               SUBJECTS:Subjects were 11 women and 4 men, aged 67 to 82 years
               (X=72.8), who were living independently in their communities.
               METHODS:Subjects were randomly prescribed 2, 5, or 8 general
               strengthening home exercises. They were instructed on their
               exercises at an initial session and asked to record the number
               of repetitions performed each day in a self-report exercise log.
               At a return session 7 to 10 days later, subjects were scored on
               their performance of the prescribed exercises using a newly
               designed assessment tool. RESULTS:The group that was prescribed
               2 exercises performed better, as defined by their performance
               tool score, than the group that was prescribed 8 exercises. The
               group that was prescribed 5 exercises was not different from the
               groups that performed 2 or 8 exercises. No differences were
               found among groups regarding the self-report measurement of
               compliance. There was a moderate correlation between performance
               scores and the self-report percentage rates. CONCLUSION AND
               DISCUSSION:Subjects who were prescribed 2 exercises performed
               better than subjects who were prescribed 8 exercises. The
               question of an optimal number of exercises to prescribe to
               elderly people warrants further study.",

              and to determine the factors predictive of a good outcome.
              SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:In 2 open uncontrolled studies, the
              success rate of intrarectal manipulation of the coccyx was around
              25\%. METHODS:Patients were randomized into 2 groups of 51
              patients each: 1 group received three sessions of coccygeal
              manipulation, and the other low-power external physiotherapy. The
              manual treatment was guided by the findings on stress
              radiographs. Patients were assessed, at 1 month and 6 months,
              using a VAS and (modified) McGill Pain, Paris (functional
              coccydynia impact), and (modified) Dallas Pain questionnaires.
              RESULTS:At baseline, the 2 groups were similar regarding all
              parameters. At 1 month, all the median VAS and questionnaire
              values were modified by -34.7\%, -36.0\%, -20.0\%, and -33.8\%,
              respectively, in the manipulation group, versus -19.1\%, -7.7\%,
              20.0\%, and -15.7\%, respectively, in the control (physiotherapy)
              group (P = 0.09 [borderline], 0.03, 0.02, and 0.02,
              respectively). Good results were twice as frequent in the
              manipulation group compared with the control group, at 1 month
              (36\% vs. 20\%, P = 0.075) and at 6 months (22\% vs. 12\%, P =
              0.18). The main predictors of a good outcome were stable coccyx,
              shorter duration, traumatic etiology, and lower score in the
              affective parts of the McGill and Dallas questionnaires.
              CONCLUSIONS:We found a mild effectiveness of intrarectal

  abstract = "BACKGROUND:Evidence suggests that brief physiotherapy programmes
              are as effective for acute whiplash-associated disorders as more
              comprehensive programmes; however, whether this also holds true
              for chronic whiplash-associated disorders is unknown. We aimed to
              estimate the effectiveness of a comprehensive exercise programme
              delivered by physiotherapists compared with advice in people with
              a chronic whiplash-associated disorder. METHODS:PROMISE is a two
              group, pragmatic randomised controlled trial in patients with
              chronic (>3 months and <5 years) grade 1 or 2 whiplash-associated
              disorder. Participants were randomly assigned by a
              computer-generated randomisation schedule to receive either the
              comprehensive exercise programme (20 sessions) or advice (one
              session and telephone support). Sealed opaque envelopes were used
              to conceal allocation. The primary outcome was pain intensity
              measured on a 0-10 scale. Outcomes were measured at baseline, 14
              weeks, 6 months, and 12 months by a masked assessor. Analysis was
              by intention to treat, and treatment effects were calculated with
              linear mixed models. The trial is registered with the Australian
              New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12609000825257.
              FINDINGS:172 participants were allocated to either the
              comprehensive exercise programme (n=86) or advice group (n=86);
              157 (91\%) were followed up at 14 weeks, 145 (84\%) at 6 months,
              and 150 (87\%) at 12 months. A comprehensive exercise programme
              was not more effective than advice alone for pain reduction in
              the participants. At 14 weeks the treatment effect on a 0-10 pain
              scale was 0·0 (95\% CI -0·7 to 0·7), at 6 months 0·2 (-0·5 to

              of treatment. We recorded no serious adverse events.
              INTERPRETATION:We have shown that simple advice is equally as
              effective as a more intense and comprehensive physiotherapy
              exercise programme. The need to identify effective and affordable
              strategies to prevent and treat acute through to chronic whiplash
              associated disorders is an important health priority. Future
              avenues of research might include improving understanding of the
              mechanisms responsible for persistent pain and disability,
              investigating the effectiveness and timing of drugs, and study of
              content and delivery of education and advice. FUNDING:The

               opioid amounts would be associated with higher risk for
               postoperative complications. Data were extracted from the
               national Premier Perspective database (2006-2013); N = 1,035,578

               Multilevel multivariable logistic regression models measured
               associations between opioid dose prescription and postoperative
               outcomes, studied by quartile of dispensed opioid dose. Compared
               to the lowest quartile of opioid dosing, high opioid
               prescription was associated with significantly increased odds
               for deep venous thrombosis and postoperative infections by
               approx. 50\%, while odds were increased by 23\% for urinary and
               more than 15\% for gastrointestinal and respiratory
               complications (P < 0.001 respectively). Furthermore, higher
               opioid prescription was associated with a significant increase
               in length of stay (LOS) and cost by 12\% and 6\%, P < 0.001

               by 25\% with higher opioid dose (P = 0.004), while odds for
               myocardial infarction remained unaltered. In spine cases, opioid

               observed for increase in LOS and cost as well as
               gastrointestinal and urinary complications. Other outcomes were
               less pronounced, possibly because of smaller sample size.
               Overall, higher opioid prescription was associated with an
               increase in most postoperative complications with the strongest
               effect observed in thromboembolic, infectious and

               commonly evaluated and treated by the hand therapist. In this
               review, diseases and disorders affecting the gastrointestinal
               (GI), hepatic/biliary, and renal/urologic systems capable of
               referring pain and other symptoms to the upper quadrant are
               presented. Specifically, these organ systems can refer pain to
               the sternum, neck, shoulder, scapulae, and subscapular and
               interscapular regions. Symptom referral from the viscera to the
               elbow and hand is extremely rare. Symptoms of carpal tunnel

              required to justify the use of mechanisms-based classifications
              of musculoskeletal pain in clinical practice. The purpose of this
              study was to evaluate the discriminative validity of
              mechanisms-based classifications of pain by identifying
              discriminatory clusters of clinical criteria predictive of
              ``nociceptive,'' ``peripheral neuropathic,'' and ``central
              sensitization'' pain in patients with low back ($\pm$ leg) pain
              disorders. METHODS:This study was a cross-sectional,
              between-patients design using the extreme-groups method. Four
              hundred sixty-four patients with low back ($\pm$ leg) pain were
              assessed using a standardized assessment protocol. After each
              assessment, patients' pain was assigned a mechanisms-based
              classification. Clinicians then completed a clinical criteria
              checklist indicating the presence/absence of various clinical
              criteria. RESULTS:Multivariate analyses using binary logistic
              regression with Bayesian model averaging identified a
              discriminative cluster of 7, 3, and 4 symptoms and signs
              predictive of a dominance of ``nociceptive,'' ``peripheral
              neuropathic,'' and ``central sensitization'' pain, respectively.
              Each cluster was found to have high levels of classification
              accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive
              values, positive/negative likelihood ratios). DISCUSSION:By
              identifying a discriminatory cluster of symptoms and signs
              predictive of ``nociceptive,'' ``peripheral neuropathic,'' and
              ``central'' pain, this study provides some preliminary
              discriminative validity evidence for mechanisms-based
              classifications of musculoskeletal pain. Classification system
              validation requires the accumulation of validity evidence before
              their use in clinical practice can be recommended. Further
              studies are required to evaluate the construct and criterion
              validity of mechanisms-based classifications of musculoskeletal

              This previously validated questionnaire focuses on 13 breast
              hypertrophy-related symptoms and their frequency. In this
              prospective multicentre study, the breast-related symptoms of 98

              health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with the 15 dimension
              (15D), a well-established generic tool. A total of 59
              participants were followed up at least 6 months postoperatively.
              The women were middle-aged (mean age 44 years) and most of them
              overweight (mean Body mass index (BMI) 29). All patients had
              frequent physical symptoms and disability due to their breasts
              and reported low breast severity symptom score (BSS mean 27,
              range 13-38). Mean amount of resected breast tissue was 1310 g
              per patient. Postoperatively, the breast-related symptoms were
              significantly relieved, and 55 of 59 operated patients reported
              less frequent or non-existent symptoms (mean BSS 59, range
              22-65). BSS score improved especially in obese women and those
              with pendulous breasts. A low preoperative BSS was related to
              considerable benefit from surgery. HRQoL score improved
              significantly from 0.889 to 0.930 (P < 0.001) and significant
              improvement was seen especially in dimensions, such as
              discomfort, usual activities and breathing. In conclusion, BRSQ
              is an easy tool to use to quantify breast-related symptoms. It
              visualised effectively the impact of the reduction mammoplasty.
              Surgical breast reduction significantly improves breast-related
              symptoms and the HRQoL among women with many breast-related
              symptoms. The present guidelines for patient selection in breast

  abstract  = "The etiology of chronic pain-related disability is not fully
               understood, particularly from a clinical perspective.
               Investigations to date have identified risk factors and
               elucidated some important processes driving the development of
               persistent pain problems. Yet this knowledge and its application
               are not always accessible to practicing physical therapists or
               other clinicians. This article aims to summarize the main
               psychological processes involved in the development of chronic
               pain disability and to derive some guidelines for treatment and
               future research. To this end, the focus is on the paradox of why
               coping strategies that are helpful in the short term continue to
               be used even when-ironically-they maintain the problem in the
               long term. To aid in summarizing current knowledge, 4 tenets
               that elucidate the etiology of chronic pain are described. These
               tenets emphasize that chronic pain disability is a developmental
               process over time, contextual factors set the stage for this
               development, underlying transdiagnostic psychological factors
               fuel this development, and the principles of learning steer the
               development of pain behaviors. With these tenets, an explanation
               of how a chronic problem develops for one person but not another
               is provided. Finally, hypotheses that can be empirically tested
               to guide clinical application as well as basic research are
               generated. In conclusion, understanding the psychological

  abstract  = "The gate control theory's most important contribution to
               understanding pain was its emphasis on central neural
               mechanisms. The theory forced the medical and biological
               sciences to accept the brain as an active system that filters,
               selects and modulates inputs. The dorsal horns, too, were not
               merely passive transmission stations but sites at which dynamic
               activities (inhibition, excitation and modulation) occurred. The
               great challenge ahead of us is to understand brain function. I
               have therefore proposed that the brain possesses a neural
               network--the body-self neuromatrix--which integrates multiple
               inputs to produce the output pattern that evokes pain. The
               body-self neuromatrix comprises a widely distributed neural
               network that includes parallel somatosensory, limbic and
               thalamocortical components that subserve the
               sensory-discriminative. affective-motivational and
               evaluative-cognitive dimensions of pain experience. The synaptic
               architecture of the neuromatrix is determined by genetic and
               sensory influences. The 'neurosignature' output of the
               neuromatrix--patterns of nerve impulses of varying temporal and
               spatial dimensions--is produced by neural programs genetically
               build into the neuromatrix and determines the particular
               qualities and other properties of the pain experience and
               behavior. Multiple inputs that act on the neuromatrix programs
               and contribute to the output neurosignature include. (1) sensory
               inputs (cutaneous, visceral and other somatic receptors); (2)
               visual and other sensory inputs that influence the cognitive
               interpretation of the situation; (3) phasic and tonic cognitive
               and emotional inputs from other areas of the brain; (4)
               intrinsic neural inhibitory modulation inherent in all brain
               function; (5) the activity of the body's stress-regulation
               systems, including cytokines as well as the endocrine,
               autonomic, immune and opioid systems. We have traveled a long
               way from the psychophysical concept that seeks a simple
               one-to-one relationship between injury and pain. We now have a
               theoretical framework in which a genetically determined template
               for the body-self is modulated by the powerful stress system and
               the cognitive functions of the brain, in addition to the
               traditional sensory inputs.",

              obtained. The behaviors studied included: open-ended questions,
              facilitation (comments or interviewer behavior that encourages
              the patient to continue talking), the open-to-closed cone (the
              gradual narrowing of focus from an initial nondirective approach
              to a more direct exploration), summarization (providing the
              patient with an explicit verbal summary of the information
              gathered thus far), and surveying problems. The subjects were 315
              patients who visited an outpatient facility. These medical
              interviews were videotaped and reviewed by a trained rater using
              the Takemura Medical Interview Rating Scale, which was developed
              to assess the use of particular medical interview behaviors and
              to measure the amount of information obtained from patients

              be used to evaluate changes in self-reported physical function
              for individuals with leg, ankle, and foot musculoskeletal
              disorders. The objective of this study was to develop an
              instrument to meet this need: the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure
              (FAAM). Additionally, this study was designed to provide validity
              evidence for interpretation of FAAM scores. METHODS: Final item
              reduction was completed using item response theory with 1027
              subjects. Validity evidence was provided by 164 subjects that
              were expected to change and 79 subjects that were expected to
              remain stable. These subjects were given the FAAM and SF-36 to
              complete on two occasions 4 weeks apart. RESULTS: The final
              version of the FAAM consists of the 21-item activities of daily
              living (ADL) and 8-item Sports subscales, which together produced
              information across the spectrum ability. Validity evidence was
              provided for test content, internal structure, score stability,
              and responsiveness. Test retest reliability was 0.89 and 0.87 for
              the ADL and Sports subscales, respectively. The minimal
              detectable change based on a 95\% confidence interval was +/-5.7
              and +/--12.3 points for the ADL and Sports subscales,
              respectively. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA and ROC analysis
              found both the ADL and Sports subscales were responsive to
              changes in status (p < 0.05). The minimal clinically important
              differences were 8 and 9 points for the ADL and Sports subscales,
              respectively. Guyatt responsive index and ROC analysis found the
              ADL subscale was more responsive than general measures of
              physical function while the Sports subscale was not. The ADL and
              Sport subscales demonstrated strong relationships with the SF-36
              physical function subscale (r = 0.84, 0.78) and physical
              component summary score (r = 0.78, 0.80) and weak relationships
              with the SF-36 mental function subscale (r = 0.18, 0.11) and
              mental component summary score (r = 0.05, -0.02). CONCLUSIONS:
              The FAAM is a reliable, responsive, and valid measure of physical
              function for individuals with a broad range of musculoskeletal
              disorders of the lower leg, foot, and ankle.",

              outcome measure was an episode of LBP, and the secondary outcome
              measure was an episode of sick leave associated with LBP. We
              calculated relative risks (RRs) and 95\% CIs using random-effects

              randomized clinical trials including 30 850 unique participants)

              that exercise alone may reduce the risk of both an LBP episode
              (0.65 [0.50-0.86]) and use of sick leave (0.22 [0.06-0.76]). For
              education alone, there was moderate- to very low-quality evidence
              of no effect on LBP (1.03 [0.83-1.27]) or sick leave (0.87
              [0.47-1.60]). There was low- to very low-quality evidence that
              back belts do not reduce the risk of LBP episodes (1.01
              [0.71-1.44]) or sick leave (0.87 [0.47-1.60]). There was
              low-quality evidence of no protective effect of shoe insoles on
              LBP (1.01 [0.74-1.40]). Conclusion and Relevance:The current
              evidence suggests that exercise alone or in combination with
              education is effective for preventing LBP. Other interventions,
              including education alone, back belts, and shoe insoles, do not
              appear to prevent LBP. Whether education, training, or ergonomic
              adjustments prevent sick leave is uncertain because the quality
              of evidence is low.",

  abstract  = "Background:The World Health Organization recognizes
               participation in meaningful life roles as a key component of
               health. However, the evidence base for interventions to improve
               participation remains inconclusive. In particular, whether
               exercise interventions improve participation in life roles is
               unclear. Purpose:The aim of this review was to evaluate the
               effect of physical exercise interventions on participation in
               life roles in older adults residing in the community. Data
               sources:The PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, and PEDro
               databases were searched from inception through March 2015. Study
               selection:Randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of
               an exercise intervention to usual care on participation in life
               roles in adults who were 60 years of age or older were included
               in this review. Data extraction:Teams of 2 investigators
               independently extracted data on participation. Methodological
               quality was appraised using the Cochrane tool for assessing the
               risk of bias. The protocol was registered with Prospero
               (CRD42014014880). Data synthesis:Eighteen randomized controlled
               trials with a total of 2,315 participants met the inclusion
               criteria. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95\% CIs
               were calculated using a random-effects model. A meta-analysis of
               16 studies showed no overall effect of the exercise
               interventions on participation (SMD = 0.03; 95\% CI = -0.10 to
               0.16). Subgroup analysis showed that exercise interventions
               lasting 12 months or more had a small positive effect on
               participation (SMD = 0.15; 95\% CI = 0.02 to 0.28).
               Limitations:Limitations included variability in definitions and
               measures of participation. Conclusions:In general, exercise
               interventions do not improve participation in life roles in
               older adults. The results do not support the implicit assumption
               that exercise-based interventions associated with improved
               function/activity also result in improved participation.
               Investigation of complex interventions that go beyond exercise
               to address participation in life roles for older adults is
               warranted.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: A treatment-based classification algorithm for low
               back pain (LBP) was created to help clinicians select treatments
               to which people are most likely to respond. To allow the
               algorithm to classify all people with LBP, additional criteria
               can help therapists make decisions for people who do not clearly
               fit into a subgroup (ie, unclear classifications). Recent
               studies indicated that classifications are unclear for
               approximately 34\% of people with LBP. OBJECTIVE: To guide
               improvements in the algorithm, it is imperative to determine
               whether people with unclear classifications are different from
               those with clear classifications. DESIGN: This study was a
               secondary analysis of data from 3 previous studies investigating
               the algorithm. METHODS: Baseline data from 529 people who had
               LBP were used (3 discrete cohorts). The primary outcome was type
               of classification, that is, clear or unclear. Univariate
               logistic regression was used to determine which participant
               variables were related to having an unclear classification.
               RESULTS: People with unclear classifications had greater odds of
               being older (odds ratio [OR]=1.01, 95\% confidence interval
               [CI]=1.003-1.033), having a longer duration of LBP (OR=1.001,
               95\% CI=1.000-1.001), having had a previous episode(s) of LBP
               (OR=1.61, 95\% CI=1.04-2.49), having fewer fear-avoidance
               beliefs related to both work (OR=0.98, 95\% CI=0.96-0.99) and
               physical activity (OR=0.98, 95\% CI=0.96-0.996), and having less
               LBP-related disability (OR=0.98, 95\% CI=0.96-0.99) than people
               with clear classifications. LIMITATIONS: Studies from which
               participant data were drawn had different inclusion criteria and
               clinical settings. CONCLUSIONS: People with unclear
               classifications appeared to be less affected by LBP (less
               disability and fewer fear avoidance beliefs), despite typically
               having a longer duration of LBP. Future studies should
               investigate whether modifying the algorithm to exclude such
               people or provide them with different interventions improves
               outcomes.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE/BACKGROUND:Previous research studies by Bolga, Ayotte,
              and Distefano have examined the level of muscle recruitment of
              the gluteal muscles for various clinical exercises; however,
              there has been no cross comparison among the top exercises from
              each study. The purpose of this study is to compare top exercises
              from these studies as well as several other commonly performed
              clinical exercises to determine which exercises recruit the
              gluteal muscles, specifically the gluteus medius and maximus,
              most effectively. METHODS:Twenty-six healthy subjects
              participated in this study. Surface EMG electrodes were placed on
              gluteus medius and maximus to measure muscle activity during 18
              exercises. Maximal voluntary muscle contraction (MVIC) was
              established for each muscle group in order to express each
              exercise as a percentage of MVIC and allow standardized
              comparison across subjects. EMG data were analyzed using a
              root-mean-square algorithm and smoothed with a 50 millisecond
              time reference. Rank ordering of the exercises was performed
              utilizing the average percent MVIC peak activity for each
              exercise. RESULTS:Twenty-four subjects satisfied all eligibility
              criteria and consented to participate in the research study. Five
              of the exercises produced greater than 70\%MVIC of the gluteus
              medius muscle. In rank order from highest EMG value to lowest,
              these exercises were: side plank abduction with dominant leg on
              bottom (103\%MVIC), side plank abduction with dominant leg on top
              (89\%MVIC), single limb squat (82\%MVIC), clamshell (hip clam)
              progression 4 (77\%MVIC), and font plank with hip extension
              (75\%MVIC). Five of the exercises recruited gluteus maximus with
              values greater than 70\%MVIC. In rank order from highest EMG
              value to lowest, these exercises were: front plank with hip
              extension (106\%MVIC), gluteal squeeze (81\%MVIC), side plank
              abduction with dominant leg on top (73\%MVIC), side plank
              abduction with dominant leg on bottom (71\%MVIC), and single limb
              squat (71\%MVIC). Four of the exercises produced greater than
              70\%MVIC for both gluteus maximus and medius muscles.
              CONCLUSIONS:Higher \%MVIC values achieved during performance of
              exercises correlate to muscle hypertrophy.(20,22) By knowing the
              \%MVIC of the gluteal musculature that occurs during various
              exercises, potential for strengthening of the gluteal muscles can
              be inferred. Additionally, exercises may be rank ordered to
              appropriately challenge the gluteal musculature during
              rehabilitation.",

              symptoms of a ``sports hernia'' and an underlying source of groin
              pain. Although several authors note conservative treatment as the
              initial step in the management of this condition, very little has
              been written on the specific description of non-surgical
              measures. Most published articles favoring operative care
              describe poor results related to conservative management; however
              they fail to report what treatment techniques comprise
              non-operative management. CASE PRESENTATION:The subject of this
              case report is a professional ice hockey player who sustained an
              abdominal injury in a game, which was diagnosed as a sports
              hernia. Following the injury, structured conservative treatment
              emphasized core control and stability with progressive peripheral
              demand challenges. Intrinsic core control emphasis continued
              throughout the treatment progression and during the functional
              training prior to return to sport. OUTCOME:The player completed
              his recovery with return to full competition seven weeks post
              injury, and continues to compete in the NHL seven years later.
              DISCUSSION:Surgical intervention has been shown to be effective
              in the treatment of the ``sports hernia.'' However it is the
              authors' opinion that conservative care emphasizing evaluation of
              intrinsic core muscular deficits and rehabilitation directed at
              addressing these deficits is an appropriate option, and should be
              considered prior to surgical intervention.",

              BACKGROUND DATA: Knowing the course of neck pain guides
              expectations for recovery. Identifying prognostic factors assists
              in planning public policies, formulating interventions, and
              promoting lifestyle changes to decrease the burden of neck pain.
              METHODS: The Bone and Joint Decade 2000-2010 Task Force on Neck
              Pain and its Associated Disorders (Neck Pain Task Force)
              conducted a critical review of literature published between 1980
              and 2006 to assemble the best evidence on neck pain. Findings
              from studies meeting criteria for scientific validity were
              abstracted into evidence tables and included in a best evidence
              synthesis. RESULTS: We found 226 articles on the course and
              prognostic factors in neck pain and its associated disorders.
              After critical review, 70 (31\%) of these were accepted on
              scientific merit. Six studies related to course and 7 to
              prognostic factors in the general population. Between half and
              three quarters of persons in these populations with current neck
              pain will report neck pain again 1 to 5 years later. Younger age
              predicted better outcome. General exercise was unassociated with
              outcome, although regular bicycling predicted poor outcome in 1
              study. Psychosocial factors, including psychologic health, coping
              patterns, and need to socialize, were the strongest prognostic
              factors. Several potential prognostic factors have not been well
              studied, including degenerative changes, genetic factors, and
              compensation policies. CONCLUSION: The Neck Pain Task Force
              undertook a best evidence synthesis to establish a baseline of
              the current best evidence on the course and prognosis for this
              symptom. General exercise was not prognostic of better outcome;
              however, several psychosocial factors were prognostic of outcome.",

  abstract  = "Background:Self-management interventions fostering self-efficacy
               improve the well-being of people with chronic pain. Purpose:The
               purpose of this study was to synthesize the enablers (what
               works) and barriers (what does not) of incorporating
               self-management strategies for people in everyday life after
               completion of a pain self-management intervention. Data
               Sources:Major electronic databases (MEDLINE, AMED, PsycINFO,
               Cochrane Library, PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and Google Scholar)
               were searched from inception to July 2016. Study Selection:Study
               selection included qualitative and mixed-method studies that
               explored the perceptions of individuals with chronic pain after
               completion of a self-management intervention. Data Extraction:A
               thematic analysis approach was used to synthesize the review
               findings, and a Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of
               Qualitative Research (CERQual) Approach was used to assess the
               level of confidence. Data Synthesis:Thirty-three studies with
               512 participants were included. Enablers to self-management
               included self-discovery-the ability to distinguish self (ie,
               body, thoughts, and feelings) from pain; feeling empowered by
               incorporating self-management strategies into practice; and
               supportive ambience via collaborative relationships with
               clinicians and support from family and friends. Barriers to
               self-management included difficulty with sustaining motivation
               for pain self-management; distress experienced from ongoing
               pain, anxiety, and depression; and unsupportive relationships
               with clinicians, family, and friends. Limitations:This review
               only included interventions that involved at least 4
               self-management skills; thus, informative studies may have been
               missed. The follow-up period varied from immediately after the
               intervention to 72 months following the intervention; therefore,
               it is uncertain which of the key enablers and barriers were most
               influential long term. Only articles published in the English
               language were included; studies conducted in low- and
               middle-income countries could not be located. Conclusions:The
               sustained effort to self-manage chronic pain could be
               exhausting, and motivation could wane over time following
               intervention. Providing intermittent support in the form of
               booster sessions and peer support groups may be important.
               Person-centered care via shared decision making and guided
               problem solving is essential to facilitating ongoing
               self-management.",

               slouched versus erect sitting posture on shoulder pain intensity
               and range of motion (ROM) in subjects with impingement. A
               same-subject repeated-measures design was utilized. Maximum
               active shoulder flexion and associated pain intensity were
               measured in 28 subjects in slouched and erect sitting postures,
               using video-analysis and visual analogue scales, respectively.
               An intra-tester reliability study of the video-analysis system
               was completed and intra-class correlation coefficients
               calculated. Shoulder flexion differences between slouched and
               erect sitting posture were analysed using a repeated-measures
               analysis of variance (ANOVA). The intra-tester reliability of
               the video-analysis method was found to be 'excellent' (ICC =
               0.99). Flexion ROM was significantly greater in the erect
               sitting posture (F = 100.3, P < 0.0001); the mean ROM difference
               between postures was 17.67 degrees (+/- 9.17 degrees). There was
               no significant difference in pain intensity between postures (F
               = 1.9, P = 0.179). An erect sitting posture appeared to increase
               active shoulder flexion in subjects with shoulder impingement,
               although there were no differences in reported pain intensity.

              encountered by clinicians, but the pathogenesis of this condition
              is not well understood. While much research has centred around
              the relationship between vastus medialis and anterior knee pain,
              little is known about the most lateral of the quadriceps muscle
              group, vastus lateralis (VL). Knowledge of the anatomical
              organization of VL is not only necessary to understand its
              precise function, but to also assist in the development of
              clinical and biomechanical models of knee dysfunction. The
              purpose of this study was to investigate the detailed morphology
              of VL, specifically to provide data relating to architecture,
              attachment sites, innervation, and the presence of anatomical
              partitioning within the muscle. The VL muscle was examined in 10
              cadaveric lower limbs using macrodissection techniques. On the
              basis of architecture and innervation, this muscle comprised four
              partitions with each receiving its own unique nerve branch. The
              mean fascicular length of VL was 7 cm and the mean fascicular and
              muscle physiological cross-sectional areas were 1.2 cm(2) and
              21.6 cm(2), respectively. In addition to inserting proximally at
              the base of the greater trochanter and distally into the
              superolateral border and base of the patella, three additional
              attachment sites were identified: the lateral intermuscular
              septum, iliotibial band, and the rectus tendon. The results of
              this study suggest that the gross morphology of VL is more
              complex than previously described, and the information provided
              regarding architecture will contribute to knowledge regarding the
              function of VL as well as its role in knee joint dysfunction.",

  abstract = "STUDY DESIGN:Cross-sectional open population based study (nested
              in a prospective cohort study). OBJECTIVE:To explore the
              association of the different individual radiographic features,
              including osteophytes and disc space narrowing, with
              self-reported low back pain (LBP). Different definitions of
              lumbar disc degeneration with self-reported LBP and disability
              were considered in a large open population sample. Furthermore,
              in order to disentangle the discrepancies in reported strength of
              the associations, we characterized the frequency of the different
              individual radiographic features of lumbar disc degeneration and
              definitions of lumbar disc degeneration, as well as their
              association with LBP status, by age, gender, and vertebral level.
              SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:Currently within the literature, there
              have been no studies that have explored different definitions of
              lumbar disc degeneration and their association with LBP within
              one study sample. METHODS:The intervertebral disc spaces (L1/2 to
              L5-S1) were evaluated for the presence and severity of anterior
              osteophytes and disc space narrowing using a semiquantitative
              score (grade 0-3). Logistic regression was used to determine the
              association between these individual radiographic features of
              lumbar disc degeneration and different definitions of lumbar disc
              degeneration for LBP. RESULTS:Lumbar radiographs were scored for
              1204 men, and 1615 women. Osteophytes were the most frequent
              radiographic feature observed, with men having the greatest
              frequency. Disc space narrowing was more frequent in women than
              men. Both radiographic features increased in frequency with
              age.Disc space narrowing appeared more strongly associated with
              LBP than osteophytes, especially in men (odds ratio [OR] = 1.9;
              95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4-2.8). Disc space narrowing at
              2 or more levels appeared more strongly associated with LBP than
              disc space narrowing at only 1 level (OR = 2.4; 95\% CI:
              1.6-3.4). After excluding level L5-S1, the strength of almost all
              associations increased. CONCLUSION:We are the first to report
              different possible lumbar disc degeneration definitions and their
              associations with LBP. Disc space narrowing at 2 or more levels
              appeared more strongly associated with LBP than other
              radiographic features, especially after excluding level L5-S1.",

              undergoing traction and flexion-extension bending. OBJECTIVES:To
              investigate the feasibility of using computerized tomography
              techniques to quantify relative vertebral motions of the cervical
              spine and cervicothoracic junction (CTJ), and to define normative
              CTJ kinematics. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:Despite developing an
              understanding of the mechanical behavior of the cervical spine,
              little remains known about the cervicothoracic junction. The CTJ
              is more difficult to image than other cervical regions given the
              anatomic features of the surrounding bones obstructing CTJ
              visualization. As such, limited data have been reported
              describing the responses of the CTJ for motions and loading in
              the sagittal plane, confounding the clinical assessment of its
              injuries and surgical treatments used at this region.
              METHODS:Helical CT images of the cervical spine and CTJ were
              acquired incrementally during each of flexion, extension, and
              cervical traction. Vertebral surfaces were reconstructed using
              the specialized image analysis software, 3DVIEWNIX. A
              mathematical description of relative vertebral motions was
              derived by computing rigid transformations. Euler angles and
              translations were calculated. Regional spine stiffness was
              defined for traction. RESULTS:The CTJ was found to be much
              stiffer (779 N/mm) than the cervical spine (317 N/mm) in tension.
              In flexion-extension bending, the CTJ was similar to the lower
              cervical spine. The CTJ demonstrated significantly less coupled
              motion than the cervical spine. CONCLUSIONS:The CTJ, as a
              transition region between the cervical and thoracic spines, has
              unique kinematic characteristics. This application of kinematic
              CT methods is useful for quantifying unreported normative ranges
              of motion for the CTJ, difficult by other conventional radiologic
              means.",

               occur in 2 to 4 percent of patients who are taking nonselective
               nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We assessed
               whether rofecoxib, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2,
               would be associated with a lower incidence of clinically
               important upper gastrointestinal events than is the nonselective
               NSAID naproxen among patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
               METHODS:We randomly assigned 8076 patients who were at least 50
               years of age (or at least 40 years of age and receiving
               long-term glucocorticoid therapy) and who had rheumatoid
               arthritis to receive either 50 mg of rofecoxib daily or 500 mg
               of naproxen twice daily. The primary end point was confirmed
               clinical upper gastrointestinal events (gastroduodenal
               perforation or obstruction, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and
               symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers). RESULTS:Rofecoxib and
               naproxen had similar efficacy against rheumatoid arthritis.
               During a median follow-up of 9.0 months, 2.1 confirmed
               gastrointestinal events per 100 patient-years occurred with
               rofecoxib, as compared with 4.5 per 100 patient-years with
               naproxen (relative risk, 0.5; 95 percent confidence interval,
               0.3 to 0.6; P<0.001). The respective rates of complicated
               confirmed events (perforation, obstruction, and severe upper
               gastrointestinal bleeding) were 0.6 per 100 patient-years and
               1.4 per 100 patient-years (relative risk, 0.4; 95 percent
               confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.8; P=0.005). The incidence of
               myocardial infarction was lower among patients in the naproxen
               group than among those in the rofecoxib group (0.1 percent vs.
               0.4 percent; relative risk, 0.2; 95 percent confidence interval,
               0.1 to 0.7); the overall mortality rate and the rate of death
               from cardiovascular causes were similar in the two groups.
               CONCLUSIONS:In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, treatment
               with rofecoxib, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, is
               associated with significantly fewer clinically important upper
               gastrointestinal events than treatment with naproxen, a

               (NCT02838134) in laparoscopic donor nephrectomy patients (n =

              efficacy of spinal manipulation against microdiskectomy in
              patients with sciatica secondary to lumbar disk herniation (LDH).
              METHODS:One hundred twenty patients presenting through elective
              referral by primary care physicians to neurosurgical spine
              surgeons were consecutively screened for symptoms of unilateral
              lumbar radiculopathy secondary to LDH at L3-4, L4-5, or L5-S1.
              Forty consecutive consenting patients who met inclusion criteria
              (patients must have failed at least 3 months of nonoperative
              management including treatment with analgesics, lifestyle
              modification, physiotherapy, massage therapy, and/or acupuncture)
              were randomized to either surgical microdiskectomy or
              standardized chiropractic spinal manipulation. Crossover to the
              alternate treatment was allowed after 3 months.
              RESULTS:Significant improvement in both treatment groups compared
              to baseline scores over time was observed in all outcome
              measures. After 1 year, follow-up intent-to-treat analysis did
              not reveal a difference in outcome based on the original
              treatment received. However, 3 patients crossed over from surgery
              to spinal manipulation and failed to gain further improvement.
              Eight patients crossed from spinal manipulation to surgery and
              improved to the same degree as their primary surgical
              counterparts. CONCLUSIONS:Sixty percent of patients with sciatica
              who had failed other medical management benefited from spinal
              manipulation to the same degree as if they underwent surgical
              intervention. Of 40\% left unsatisfied, subsequent surgical
              intervention confers excellent outcome. Patients with symptomatic
              LDH failing medical management should consider spinal
              manipulation followed by surgery if warranted.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND:The WOMAC is the most widely used self-report measure
               to evaluate physical functioning in hip or knee osteoarthritis,
               however its ability to discriminate pain and physical
               functioning (i.e. discriminate validity) has repeatedly been
               questioned. Little to no data is available on the discriminant
               validity of alternative questionnaires that measure the same
               construct, for instance the Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome
               Score (HOOS and KOOS, respectively) and the Lower Extremity
               Function Scale (LEFS). Therefore, we translated the LEFS to
               Dutch and studied its psychometric properties (i.e. validity,
               reliability and responsiveness). In addition, we assessed the
               discriminate validity of the LEFS, HOOS and KOOS. METHODS:After
               translation with a forward/backward protocol, 401 individuals
               with hip or knee osteoarthritis completed the LEFS, HOOS/KOOS,
               SF-36, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Checklist
               Individual Strength questionnaires. To assess reliability and
               responsiveness, a sample of 106 and 108 patients completed a
               comparable set of questionnaires within 3 weeks and 3 months,
               respectively. Feasibility, validity, reliability and
               responsiveness were evaluated. Discriminant validity of the
               LEFS, HOOS and KOOS was examined by contrasting the scales'
               correlations with the physical functioning subscale of the SF-36
               with the scales' correlations with the bodily pain subscale of
               the SF-36. RESULTS:The Dutch version of the LEFS was feasible,
               had good internal consistency (0.96), good reliability (ICC =
               0.86), good construct and discriminant validity, and showed no
               floor or ceiling effects. The minimal detectable change (MDC90)
               was ten points. Area under the receiver operating characteristic
               curve (AUC) analyses revealed good (AUC = 0.76) and fair (AUC =
               0.63) responsiveness for the LEFS in improved and worsened
               patients, respectively. Discriminant validity for pain was
               apparent for the LEFS (p < 0.01), but not for the HOOS and KOOS
               (p = 0.21 and p = 0.20, respectively). CONCLUSIONS:Considering
               the LEFS' good psychometric qualities and ability to
               discriminate between pain and functioning, we recommend the LEFS
               as the outcome measure of choice to assess self-reported
               physical functioning in individuals with hip or knee
               osteoarthritis.",

              located in the dural sac results in a polyradicular
              symptomatology clinically diagnosed as cauda equina syndrome. The
              cauda equina nerve roots provide the sensory and motor
              innervation of most of the lower extremities, the pelvic floor
              and the sphincters. Therefore, in a fully developed cauda equina
              syndrome, multiple signs of sensory disorders may appear. These
              disorders include low-back pain, saddle anesthesia, bilateral
              sciatica, then motor weakness of the lower extremities or chronic
              paraplegia and, bladder dysfunction. Multiple etiologies can
              cause the cauda equina syndrome. Among them, non-neoplastic
              compressive etiologies such as herniated lumbosacral discs and
              spinal stenosis and spinal neoplasms play a significant role in
              the development of the cauda equina syndrome. Non-compressive
              etiologies of the cauda equina syndrome include ischemic insults,
              inflammatory conditions, spinal arachnoiditis and other
              infectious etiologies. The use of canine, porcine and rat models
              mimicking the cauda equina syndrome enabled discovery of the
              effects of the compression on nerve root neural and vascular
              anatomy, the impairment of impulse propagation and the changes of
              the neurotransmitters in the spinal cord after compression of
              cauda equina. The involvement of intrinsic spinal cord neurons in
              the compression-induced cauda equina syndrome includes
              anterograde, retrograde and transneuronal degeneration in the
              lumbosacral segments. Prominent changes of NADPH diaphorase
              exhibiting, Fos-like immunoreactive and heat shock protein HSP72
              were detected in the lumbosacral segments in a short-and

               with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Exercise is integral to
               management, yet exercise adherence is problematic.
               Telephone-based health coaching is an attractive adjunct to
               physical therapist-prescribed exercise that may improve
               adherence. Little is known about the perceptions and
               interpretations of physical therapists, telephone coaches, and
               patients engaged in this model of care. OBJECTIVES:The purpose
               of this study was to explore how stakeholders (physical
               therapists, telephone coaches, and patients) experienced, and
               made sense of, being involved in an integrated program of
               physical therapist-supervised exercise and telephone coaching
               for people with knee OA. DESIGN:A cross-sectional qualitative
               design drawing from symbolic interactionism was used.
               METHODS:Semistructured interviews with 10 physical therapists, 4
               telephone coaches, and 6 patients with painful knee OA.
               Interviews were audiorecorded, transcribed, and analyzed using
               thematic analysis informed by grounded theory. RESULTS:Four
               themes emerged: (1) genuine interest and collaboration, (2)
               information and accountability, (3) program structure, and (4)
               roles and communication in teamwork. Patients reported they
               appreciated personalized, genuine interest from therapists and
               coaches and were aware of their complementary roles. A
               collaborative approach, with defined roles and communication
               strategies, was identified as important for effectiveness. All
               participants highlighted the importance of sharing information,
               monitoring, and being accountable to others. Coaches found the
               lack of face-to-face contact with patients hampered relationship
               building. Therapists and coaches referred to the importance of
               teamwork in delivering the intervention. LIMITATIONS:The small
               number of physical therapists and telephone coaches who
               delivered the intervention may have been biased toward favorable
               experiences with the intervention and may not be representative
               of their respective professions. CONCLUSIONS:Integrated physical
               therapy and telephone coaching was perceived as beneficial by
               most stakeholders. Programs should be structured but have some
               flexibility to give therapists and coaches some freedom to
               adjust treatment to individual patient needs as required.

              factors, and neurovascular function on foot ulcer risk among 749
              diabetic veterans with 1,483 lower limbs. RESEARCH DESIGN AND
              METHODS: Eligible subjects included all diabetic enrollees of a
              general internal medicine clinic without foot ulcer, of whom 83\%
              agreed to participate. Baseline assessment included history and
              lower-limb physical examination, tests for sensory and autonomic
              neuropathy, and measurements of macro- and microvascular
              perfusion in the foot. Subjects were followed for the occurrence
              of a full thickness skin defect on the foot that took > 14 days
              to heal, with a mean follow-up of 3.7 years. RESULTS: Using
              stepwise Cox regression analysis, the following factors were
              independently related to foot ulcer risk: foot insensitivity to
              the 5.07 monofilament (relative risk [95\% CI]) 2.2 (1.5-3.1),
              past history of amputation 2.8 (1.8-4.3) or foot ulcer 1.6
              (1.2-2.3), insulin use 1.6 (1.1-2.2), Charcot deformity 3.5
              (1.2-9.9), 15 mmHg higher dorsal foot transcutaneous PO2 0.8
              (0.7-0.9), 20 kg higher body weight 1.2 (1.1-1.4), 0.3 higher
              ankle-arm index 0.8 (0.7-1.0), poor vision 1.9 (1.4-2.6), and 13
              mmHg orthostatic blood pressure fall 1.2 (1.1-1.5). Higher ulcer
              risk was associated with hammer/claw toe deformity and history of
              laser photocoagulation in certain subgroups. Unrelated to foot
              ulcer risk in multivariate models were diabetes duration and
              type, race, smoking status, diabetes education, joint mobility,
              hallux blood pressure, and other foot deformities. CONCLUSIONS:
              Certain foot deformities, reduced skin oxygenation and foot
              perfusion, poor vision, greater body mass, and both sensory and
              autonomic neuropathy independently influence foot ulcer risk,

              with knee osteoarthritis (OA), and if so which indices of central
              pain modulation predict poor outcome after TKR. To identify
              relevant articles, PubMed and Web of Science were searched. The
              search strategy was a combination of key words related to ``Knee
              Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement'', ``Central Pain
              Modulation'' and ``Post-Surgical Outcome Measures''. Articles
              fulfilling the inclusion criteria were screened for
              methodological quality and results were analyzed and summarized.
              Sixteen prospective cohort studies were included. Strong evidence
              is available that presence of catastrophic thinking and poor
              coping strategies predict more pain after TKR and that there is
              no association between fear of movement and post-surgical pain or
              function. Evidence on other psychosocial influences is limited or
              conflicting. Literature on the influence of other signs of
              altered central pain modulation on post-surgical outcome is
              scarce. It is plausible that pre-surgical signs of altered
              central pain modulation, such as joint pain at rest or widespread
              pain sensitization, predict more post-surgical pain. Surgeons
              should be attentive for patients with signs of altered central
              pain modulation before surgery as they might be at risk for
              unfavorable outcome. A broader therapeutic approach aiming to
              desensitize the central nervous system can be adapted in these
              patients. Further research is however needed to identify the
              influence of central pain modulation pre-surgical in predicting
              outcome after TKR.",

  abstract = "UNLABELLED:This paper advances a psychophysiological systems view
              of pain in which physical injury, or wounding, generates a
              complex stress response that extends beyond the nervous system
              and contributes to the experience of pain. Through a common
              chemical language comprising neurotransmitters, peptides,
              endocannabinoids, cytokines, and hormones, an ensemble of
              interdependent nervous, endocrine, and immune processes operates
              in concert to cope with the injury. These processes act as a
              single agent and comprise a supersystem. Acute pain in its
              multiple dimensions, and the related symptoms that commonly occur
              with it, are products of the supersystem. Chronic pain can
              develop as a result of unusual stress. Social stressors can
              compound the stress resulting from a wound or act alone to
              dysregulate the supersystem. When the supersystem suffers
              dysregulation, health, function, and sense of well-being suffer.
              Some chronic pain conditions are the product of supersystem
              dysregulation. Individuals vary and are vulnerable to
              dysregulation and dysfunction in particular organ systems due to
              the unique interactions of genetic, epigenetic and environmental
              factors, as well as the past experiences that characterize each
              person. PERSPECTIVE:Acute tissue injury activates an ensemble of
              interdependent nervous, endocrine, and immune processes that
              operate in concert and comprise a supersystem. Some chronic pain
              conditions result from supersystem dysregulation. Individuals
              vary and are vulnerable to dysregulation due to the unique
              interactions of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors
              and past experiences that characterize each person. This
              perspective can potentially assist clinicians in assessing and
              managing chronic pain patients.",

               back pain (LBP) have failed to arrest the exponential increase
               in health care costs, with a concurrent increase in disability
               and chronicity. Health messages regarding the vulnerability of
               the spine and a failure to target the interplay among multiple
               factors that contribute to pain and disability may partly
               explain this situation. Although many approaches and subgrouping
               systems for disabling LBP have been proposed in an attempt to
               deal with this complexity, they have been criticized for being
               unidimensional and reductionist and for not improving outcomes.
               Cognitive functional therapy was developed as a flexible
               integrated behavioral approach for individualizing the
               management of disabling LBP. This approach has evolved from an
               integration of foundational behavioral psychology and
               neuroscience within physical therapist practice. It is
               underpinned by a multidimensional clinical reasoning framework
               in order to identify the modifiable and nonmodifiable factors
               associated with an individual's disabling LBP. This article

               and treatment for functional mobility deficits. Purpose:This
               study aimed to determine which physical performance measures
               (PPMs) were effective in identifying preclinical disability in
               individuals at risk for future disability. Data Sources:CINHAL,
               PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched until
               September 2017 using key words. Study Selection:Two individuals
               screened peer-reviewed prospective longitudinal studies that
               assessed healthy individuals > 45 years old using PPMs at
               baseline. Eight studies met inclusion criteria. Data
               Extraction:Two individuals extracted data on participant
               demographics, PPMs, predictive validity effect size, and
               disability outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality
               Assessment Tool for Cohort Studies II (Q-Coh II). Data
               Synthesis:Four constructs were used to guide data synthesis:
               functional mobility, activities of daily living disability,
               fall(s), and hospitalization. Multiple sit-to-stands from a
               chair, standing balance, and gait speed were found to have some
               merit in identifying preclinical disability across all 4
               disability constructs. All studies were scored as good-quality
               studies using the Q-Coh II. Limitations:The heterogeneity in
               follow-up times and reporting of risk prediction statistics made
               it difficult to compare results across studies, PPMs, and
               constructs. The 4 constructs used as markers of preclinical
               disability potentially do not fully capture the progression of
               disability. Conclusions:Physical therapists should consider
               using PPMs on healthy adult populations to gather baseline data
               during annual health screens for use in identifying preclinical
               disability.",

  title     = "Sodium channels and mechanisms of neuropathic pain",
  author    = "Devor, Marshall",
  abstract  = "UNLABELLED:Na+ channels are large transmembrane proteins with a
               voltage-gated central pore capable of selectively passing Na+
               ions. They are critical determinants of the electrical
               excitability of sensory neurons and play a key role in pain
               sensation by controlling afferent impulse discharge. Injury and
               disease affecting peripheral nerves induces axonopathy and
               demyelination. These neuropathic changes, in turn, trigger
               membrane remodeling in injured afferents and perhaps also in
               uninjured neighbors. A major consequence of the remodeling is
               increased cellular excitability. This is due in large part to
               subtype-selective abnormalities in the expression and
               trafficking of Na+ channels and perhaps also to altered kinetic
               properties of unitary channels. Hyperexcitable neurons show
               enhanced membrane resonance, rhythmogenesis, and ectopic
               spiking. The resulting excess discharge constitutes a primary
               neuropathic pain signal. In addition, it triggers and maintains
               central sensitization. This amplifies residual afferent input,
               yielding tactile allodynia, and it also amplifies ongoing
               ectopia that exaggerates spontaneous pain. Membrane-stabilizing
               Na+ channel ligands suppress neuropathic pain by selectively
               reducing membrane resonance in injured afferents and hence
               ectopic hyperexcitability. The clinical usefulness of these
               peripherally acting drugs might be enhanced by reducing their
               central side effects. PERSPECTIVE:Neuropathic pain is a complex
               outcome of multiple pathophysiological changes that develop in
               the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and the central nervous
               system (CNS) following nerve injury or disease. All or most of
               the CNS changes are thought to be due to abnormal signaling from
               the PNS, notably electrical hyperexcitability of peripheral
               sensory neurons. Because hyperexcitability is associated with
               abnormal sodium channel regulation, this process is a prime
               target for therapeutic intervention.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND:The STarT Back Screening Tool (SBT) was recently
               developed for primary care providers to use as a screening tool
               for subgrouping people with low back pain (LBP) on the basis of
               modifiable prognostic factors. The use of the SBT in physical
               therapy has not been described. OBJECTIVE:The aims of this study
               were to describe the use of the SBT in people receiving physical
               therapy for LBP and to describe patterns of change in clinical
               outcomes across the episode of care and among SBT categories.
               DESIGN:This study was a prospective case series. METHODS:A total
               of 214 patients receiving physical therapy for LBP were
               administered the SBT at the initial evaluation. Treatment was at
               the physical therapist's discretion. Clinical outcomes included
               pain intensity and disability scores collected at each session.
               Descriptive statistics were calculated, and baseline
               characteristics among SBT categories were compared. Hierarchical
               linear mixed models were used to examine patterns of change in
               predicted outcomes across the episode of care. RESULTS:The
               patients' mean age was 44.3 years (SD=15.8), and 56.5\% were
               women. The SBT categorized 33.2\% of the patients as being at
               low risk, 47.7\% as being at medium risk, and 19.2\% as being at
               high risk. The high-risk category corresponded to the highest
               initial pain intensity and disability scores. The low-risk
               category corresponded to the lowest initial pain intensity and
               disability scores. Linear mixed models indicated different
               patterns of change in outcome scores for pain intensity (F=3.99)
               and disability (F=3.49) among SBT categories. Relative to the
               low-risk category, the high-risk category had larger
               improvements in predicted outcomes and the medium-risk category
               had similar improvements in predicted outcomes. Limitations The
               SBT was not administered to 24\% of eligible patients. The
               timing of follow-up assessments was variable. CONCLUSIONS:The
               SBT may provide important prognostic information for physical
               therapists.",

              summarize evidence and methodological quality from systematic
              reviews of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for the
              fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Methods. The PubMed/MEDLINE,
              Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases were screened from their
              inception to Sept 2013 to identify systematic reviews and
              meta-analyses of CAM interventions for FMS. Methodological
              quality of reviews was rated using the AMSTAR instrument.
              Results. Altogether 25 systematic reviews were found; they
              investigated the evidence of CAM in general, exercised-based CAM
              therapies, manipulative therapies, Mind/Body therapies,
              acupuncture, hydrotherapy, phytotherapy, and homeopathy.
              Methodological quality of reviews ranged from lowest to highest
              possible quality. Consistently positive results were found for
              tai chi, yoga, meditation and mindfulness-based interventions,
              hypnosis or guided imagery, electromyogram (EMG) biofeedback, and
              balneotherapy/hydrotherapy. Inconsistent results concerned
              qigong, acupuncture, chiropractic interventions,
              electroencephalogram (EEG) biofeedback, and nutritional
              supplements. Inconclusive results were found for homeopathy and
              phytotherapy. Major methodological flaws included missing details
              on data extraction process, included or excluded studies, study
              details, and adaption of conclusions based on quality assessment.
              Conclusions. Despite a growing body of scientific evidence of CAM
              therapies for the management of FMS systematic reviews still show
              methodological flaws limiting definite conclusions about their
              efficacy and safety.",

               following a new primary care consultation for low back pain
               (LBP) and to examine the relations between physical therapy
               utilization and other variables with health care utilization and
               costs in the year after consultation. DESIGN:Retrospective
               cohort obtained from electronic medical records and insurance
               claims data. SETTING:Single health care delivery system.
               PARTICIPANTS:Individuals (N=2184) older than 18 years with a new
               consultation for LBP from 2004 to 2008. INTERVENTIONS:Patients
               were categorized as receiving initial physical therapy
               management if care occurred within 14 days after consultation.
               MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:Total health care costs for all
               LBP-related care received in the year after consultation were
               calculated from claims data. Predictors of utilization of
               emergency care, advanced imaging, epidural injections,
               specialist visits, and surgery were identified using
               multivariate logistic regression. The generalized linear model
               was used to compare LBP-related costs based on physical therapy
               utilization and identify other cost determinants.
               RESULTS:Initial physical therapy was received by 286 of the 2184
               patients (13.1\%), and was not a determinant of LBP-related
               health care costs or utilization of specific services in the
               year after consultation. Older age, mental health, or neck pain
               comorbidity and initial management with opioids were
               determinants of cost and several utilization outcomes.
               CONCLUSIONS:Initial physical therapy management was not
               associated with increased health care costs or utilization of
               specific services following a new primary care LBP consultation.
               Additional research is needed to examine the cost consequences

              to help them sort through complex clinical information and
              formulate diagnoses efficiently. Practice would come to a halt
              without them. However, there are pitfalls to the use of certain
              heuristics, the same ones to which humans are prone in everyday
              life. It may be possible to improve clinical decision making
              through techniques that minimize biases inherent in heuristics.
              Five common clinical heuristics or other sources of cognitive
              error are illustrated through neurological cases with missed
              diagnoses, and literature from cognitive psychology and medicine
              are presented to support the occurrence of these errors in
              diagnostic reasoning as general phenomena. Articulation of the
              errors inherent in certain common heuristics alerts clinicians to
              their weaknesses as diagnosticians and should be beneficial to
              practice. Analysis of cases with missed diagnoses in teaching
              conferences might proceed along formal lines that identify the
              type of heuristic used and of inherent potential cognitive
              errors. Addressing these cognitive errors by becoming conscious
              of them is a useful tool in neurologic education and should

  abstract  = "This article describes the development and validation of the
               S-LANSS score, a self-report version of the Leeds Assessment of
               Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs pain scale. The S-LANSS aims to
               identify pain of predominantly neuropathic origin, as distinct
               from nociceptive pain, without the need for clinical
               examination. Two hundred patients with chronic pain were asked
               to complete the S-LANSS unaided. A researcher then administered
               the S-LANSS scale and the Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS) in
               interview format. An independent clinician determined the pain
               type (neuropathic versus nociceptive) and rated his or her
               certainty about diagnosis. The S-LANSS scale was also
               incorporated into a chronic pain questionnaire that was sent to
               160 community patients and 150 newly referred patients waiting
               for pain clinic assessment. The S-LANSS scale correctly
               identified 75\% of pain types when self-completed and 80\% when
               used in interview format. Sensitivity for self-completed S-LANSS
               scores ranged from 74\% to 78\%, depending on the cutoff score.
               There were significant associations between NPS items and total
               score with S-LANSS score. In the postal survey, completed
               questionnaires were returned by 57\% of patients (n = 174).
               Internal consistency and convergent validity of the survey
               S-LANSS scores were confirmed. The findings support the S-LANSS
               scale as a valid and reliable self-report instrument for
               identifying neuropathic pain and it is also acceptable for use
               in postal survey research. Establishing valid measures of
               symptoms and signs in neuropathic pain will allow standardized
               comparisons with other investigational measures. This might lead
               to new insights into the relationship between pathophysiologic
               mechanisms and clinical manifestations of pain.",

               was to examine the impact of continuity of the physical therapy
               provider on health care use and costs in patients with LBP
               referred from primary care. Design:The study design included a

               Results:Patients who experienced greater physical therapy
               provider continuity had a decreased likelihood of receiving
               lumbar surgery. They also paid less (mean = $\{\$\}$1737 [95\%

  abstract = "STUDY DESIGN:A double-blind randomized crossover experimental
              study with repeated measures, including a no-treatment control
              condition. OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the initial effect of 2
              mobilization with movement (MWM) treatment techniques performed
              in weight bearing and non-weight bearing on posterior talar glide
              and talocrural dorsiflexion in individuals with recurrent lateral
              ankle sprain. BACKGROUND:MWM treatment techniques are commonly
              used in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain, such as lateral
              ankle sprain. Recent evidence indicates that a lack of posterior
              talar glide and weight-bearing ankle dorsiflexion are common
              physical impairments in individuals with recurrent ankle sprains.
              MWM of the ankle joint involves the application of a combined
              posterior talar glide mobilization and active dorsiflexion
              movement. The recurrent ankle sprain injury and the MWM treatment
              techniques for the ankle seemingly provide an appropriate model
              to further evaluate the effects and mechanism(s) of action of the
              MWM treatment techniques in a way that they have not been tested
              to date. METHODS:Sixteen subjects (mean +/- SD age, 19.8 +/- 2.3
              years) with a history of recurrent lateral ankle sprain and
              deficits in posterior talar glide (71\%) and weight-bearing
              dorsiflexion (34\%) were studied. A within-subjects study design
              was used to evaluate the effect of 2 independent variables:
              treatment conditions (weight-bearing MWM, non-weight-bearing MWM,
              and a no-treatment control group) and time (pretreatment and
              posttreatment) on the dependent variables of posterior talar
              glide and weight-bearing dorsiflexion. RESULTS:Both the
              weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing MWM treatment techniques
              significantly improved posterior talar glide by 55\% and 50\% of
              the preapplication deficit between affected and unaffected sides,
              respectively, which was significantly greater than that of the
              control group (P<.001). The weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing
              MWM treatment techniques improved weight-bearing dorsiflexion by
              26\% (P<.017), compared to 9\% for the control condition. The
              change in posterior talar glide, expressed as a proportion of
              pretreatment deficit, was correlated to the change in
              weight-bearing dorsiflexion (r = .88, P<.001), but only after the
              weight-bearing MWM technique. CONCLUSION:This preliminary study
              demonstrated an initial ameliorative effect of MWM treatment
              techniques on posterior talar glide and dorsiflexion range of
              motion in individuals with recurrent lateral ankle sprain. These
              results suggest that this technique should be considered in
              rehabilitation programs following lateral ankle sprain. This
              study provides justification for follow-up research of the
              long-term effects of MWM on lateral ankle sprain and proposes
              further work be conducted on the posterior talar glide test.",

               falls and fall-related risk factors within a 6-month follow-up
               period in individuals after TKA. Design:This study was a
               prospective cohort study. Methods:Knee proprioception, the
               Balance Systems Evaluation Test, knee pain, knee extension and
               flexion muscle strength, knee range of motion, and balance
               confidence were evaluated in 134 individuals (39 men, 95 women;

               Monthly follow-up sessions, via face-to-face or telephone
               interviews, were implemented to obtain data on fall incidence
               over 6 months. Results:Twenty-three individuals after TKA
               (17.2\%) sustained at least 1 fall during the 6-month follow-up
               period. The median time of the first fall episode was 15 weeks
               after TKA. Of the 31 fall episodes, most occurred during walking
               (67.7\%). Slipping (35.5\%) and tripping (35.5\%) were
               identified as the most frequent causes of falling. Most falls
               occurred at home (45.2\%) or another indoor environment
               (29.0\%). Multivariate binary logistic regression revealed that
               younger age (odds ratio: 0.91), reduced proprioception of the
               knee that had undergone surgery (``operated knee'') (odds ratio:

               greater operated knee pain (odds ratio: 1.68) were significantly
               associated with more falls during the follow-up period.
               Limitations:The results of this study may be generalizable up to
               6 months after TKA. Conclusions:Intervention efforts should

  abstract = "STUDY DESIGN:Cohort study of patients with low back pain (LBP)
              receiving physical therapy. OBJECTIVE:To examine the
              responsiveness characteristics of the numerical pain rating scale
              (NPRS) in patients with LBP using a variety of methods. SUMMARY
              OF BACKGROUND DATA:Although several studies have assessed the
              reliability and validity of the NPRS, few studies have
              characterized its responsiveness in patients with LBP.
              METHODS:Determination of change on the NPRS during 1 and 4 weeks
              was examined by calculating mean change, standardized effect
              size, Guyatt Responsiveness Index, area under a receiver
              operating characteristic curve, minimum clinically important
              difference, and minimum detectable change. Change in the NPRS
              from baseline to the 1 and 4-week follow-up was compared to the
              average of the patient and therapist's perceived improvement
              using the 15-point Global Rating of Change scale. RESULTS:The
              majority of patients had clinically meaningful improvement after
              both 1 and 4 weeks of rehabilitation. The standard error of
              measure was equal to 1.02, corresponding to a minimum detectable
              change of 2 points. The area under the curve at the 1 and 4-week
              follow-up was 0.72 (0.62, 0.81) and 0.92 (0.86, 0.97),
              respectively. The minimum clinically important difference at the
              1 and 4-week follow-up corresponded to a change of 2.2 and 1.5
              points, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:Clinicians can be confident
              that a 2-point change on the NPRS represents clinically
              meaningful change that exceeds the bounds of measurement error.",

               assessment and management of chronic musculoskeletal conditions
               is recognized. Physical therapists have been encouraged to
               develop psychologically informed practice. Little is known about
               the process of physical therapists' learning and delivering of
               psychological interventions within the practice context.
               OBJECTIVE:The aim of this study was to investigate physical
               therapists' experiences and perspectives of a
               cognitive-behavioral-informed training and intervention process
               as part of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving adults
               with painful knee osteoarthritis. DESIGN:A qualitative design
               was used. Participants were physical therapists trained to
               deliver pain coping skills training (PCST). METHODS:Eight
               physical therapists trained to deliver PCST were interviewed by
               telephone at 4 time points during the 12-month RCT period.
               Interviews were audiorecorded, transcribed verbatim into
               computer-readable files, and analyzed using Framework Analysis.
               RESULTS:Thematic categories identified were: training,
               experience delivering PCST, impact on general clinical practice,
               and perspectives on PCST and physical therapist practice.
               Physical therapists reported positive experiences with PCST and
               program delivery. They thought that their participation in the
               RCT had enhanced their general practice. Although some
               components of the PCST program were familiar, the therapists
               found delivering the program was quite different from regular
               practice. Physical therapists believed the PCST program, a 3- to
               4-day workshop followed by formal mentoring and performance
               feedback from a psychologist for 3 to 6 months and during the
               RCT, was critical to their ability to effectively deliver the
               PCST intervention. They identified a number of challenges in
               delivering PCST in their normal practice. CONCLUSION:Physical
               therapists can be trained to confidently deliver a PCST program.
               The physical therapists in this study believed that training
               enhanced their clinical practice. Comprehensive training and
               mentoring by psychologists was crucial to ensure treatment

  abstract = "BACKGROUND:Pain radiating below the knee is typically thought to
              originate from the lumbosacral spine rather than degenerative hip
              pathology. We investigated the lower limb distribution of pain
              using body image maps in 60 patients awaiting primary hip
              arthroplasty and in 60 patients awaiting spinal decompression for
              confirmed spinal stenosis. The perception of 33 orthopaedic
              registrars regarding distribution of hip pain was also assessed.
              RESULTS:Groin and buttock pain are significantly more common in
              hip osteoarthritis. The presence of groin pain is 84.3\% of those
              sensitive for hip dysfunction with a specificity of 70.3\%.
              Patients with hip osteoarthritis had pain below the knee in 47\%
              of cases whereas 88.5\% of orthopaedic trainees believed hip pain
              did not radiate below the knee. Radiographic features of
              osteoarthritis within the hip joint, visual analogue pain score
              or Oxford Hip Score have no significant association with a
              patient's distribution of hip pain. CONCLUSIONS:Hip pain referred
              below the knee is common with a degenerate hip joint and follows
              the distribution of the saphenous nerve, which branches from the
              femoral nerve. Radiographic deterioration of a hip joint does not
              correlate with pain distribution or patient dysfunction as
              measured by the Oxford Hip Score.",

              physiotherapy for patients who were newly diagnosed with
              degenerative cervical spine disorders. METHODS:A prospective
              series of 30 patients with newly diagnosed degenerative cervical
              spine disease were referred to our department and followed up for
              the initial two sessions of physiotherapy. The patients were
              assessed after each session. Outcome parameters studied included
              pain using a visual analogue scale (VAS), neck range of movements
              and activities of daily living (ADL). RESULTS:Our study subjects
              comprised mainly females (60\%) in their fifties (46.7\%) who
              worked as clerks or secretaries (53.3\%). There was an
              improvement in the patients' pain score (VAS) from a median of 8
              to 4 after two visits to the physiotherapists. Slight improvement
              in the neck range of movements was also observed. Marked
              improvement was seen in ADL, especially in the ability to carry
              heavy objects. CONCLUSION:Physiotherapy is an effective initial
              option for patients with newly presented degenerative cervical
              spine disease. The results of this study can be used to advise
              patients on the short-term benefits of physiotherapy.",

              musculoskeletal system which can be disabling and costly to
              society. Mechanical traction is often used as an adjunct therapy
              in outpatient rehabilitation. OBJECTIVES:To assess the effects of
              mechanical traction for neck disorders. SEARCH STRATEGY:A
              research librarian searched computerized bibliographic databases
              without language restrictions up to March 2008 for randomized
              controlled trials (RCTs) from the medical, chiropractic, and
              allied health literature. SELECTION CRITERIA:The RCTs we selected
              examined adults with neck disorders who received mechanical
              traction alone or in combination with other treatments compared
              to a placebo or another treatment. Our outcomes of interest were
              pain, function, disability, global perceived effect, patient
              satisfaction, and quality of life measures. DATA COLLECTION AND
              ANALYSIS:Two review authors with different backgrounds in
              medicine, physiotherapy, massage therapy and chiropractics
              independently conducted study selection, risk of bias assessment
              and data abstraction using pre-piloted forms. We resolved
              disagreement through consensus. MAIN RESULTS:Of the seven
              selected RCTs (total participants = 958), only one (N = 100) had
              a low risk of bias. It found no statistically significant
              difference (SMD -0.16: 95\%CI: -0.59 to 0.27) between continuous
              traction and placebo traction in reducing pain or improving
              function for chronic neck disorders with radicular symptoms. Our
              review found no evidence from RCTs with a low potential for bias
              that clearly supports or refutes the use of either continuous or
              intermittent traction for neck disorders. AUTHORS'
              CONCLUSIONS:The current literature does not support or refute the
              efficacy or effectiveness of continuous or intermittent traction
              for pain reduction, improved function or global perceived effect
              when compared to placebo traction, tablet or heat or other
              conservative treatments in patients with chronic neck disorders.
              Large, well conducted RCTs are needed to first determine the

  abstract = "Study Design Controlled laboratory study. Background Balance
              training may improve motor coordination. However, little is known
              about the changes in motor coordination during unexpected
              perturbations to postural control following balance training.
              Objectives To study the effects of balance training on motor
              coordination and knee mechanics during perturbed sidestep cutting
              maneuvers in healthy adults. Methods Twenty-six healthy men were
              randomly assigned to a training group or a control group. Before
              balance training, subjects performed unperturbed, 90° sidestep
              cutting maneuvers and 1 unexpected perturbed cut (10-cm
              translation of a movable platform). Participants in the training
              group participated in a 6-week balance training program, while
              those in the control group followed their regular activity
              schedule. Both groups were retested after a 6-week period.
              Surface electromyography was recorded from 16 muscles of the
              supporting limb and trunk, as well as kinematics and ground
              reaction forces. Motor modules were extracted from
              electromyography by nonnegative matrix factorization. External
              knee abduction moments were calculated using inverse dynamics
              equations. Results Balance training reduced the external knee
              abduction moment (33\% $\pm$ 25\%, P<.03, $\eta$p(2) = 0.725) and
              increased the activation of trunk and proximal hip muscles in
              specific motor modules during perturbed cutting. Balance training
              also increased burst duration for the motor module related to
              landing early in the perturbation phase (23\% $\pm$ 11\%, P<.01,
              $\eta$p(2) = 0.532). Conclusion Balance training resulted in
              altered motor coordination and a reduction in knee abduction
              moment during an unexpected perturbation. The previously reported
              reduction in injury incidence following balance training may be
              linked to changes in dynamic postural stability and modular

              combined with cervical spine nonthrust manipulation (experimental
              group) versus cervical spine nonthrust manipulation alone
              (comparison group) in individuals with mechanical neck pain.
              BACKGROUND:Research has demonstrated improved outcomes with both
              nonthrust manipulation directed at the cervical spine and thrust
              manipulation directed at the thoracic spine in patients with neck
              pain. Previous studies have not determined if thoracic spine
              thrust manipulation may increase benefits beyond those provided
              by cervical nonthrust manipulation alone. METHODS:Sixty-four
              participants with mechanical neck pain were randomized into 1 of
              2 groups, an experimental or comparison group. Both groups
              received 2 treatment sessions of cervical spine nonthrust
              manipulation and a home exercise program consisting of active
              range-of-motion exercises, and the experimental group received
              additional thoracic spine thrust manipulations. Outcome measures
              were collected at baseline and at a 1-week follow-up, and
              included the numeric pain rating scale, the Neck Disability
              Index, and the global rating of change. RESULTS:Participants in
              the experimental group demonstrated significantly greater
              improvements (P<.001) on both the numeric pain rating scale and
              Neck Disability Index at the 1-week follow-up compared to those
              in the comparison group. In addition, 31 of 33 (94\%)
              participants in the experimental group, compared to 11 of 31
              participants (35\%) in the comparison group, indicated a global
              rating of change score of +4 or higher at the 1-week follow-up,
              with an associated number needed to treat of 2.
              CONCLUSION:Individuals with neck pain who received a combination
              of thoracic spine thrust manipulation and cervical spine
              nonthrust manipulation plus exercise demonstrated better overall
              short-term outcomes on the numeric pain rating scale, the Neck

               This study aimed to determine the efficacy of a combined
               physiotherapy treatment that comprised all of these strategies.
               By concealed randomisation, 57 chronic low back pain patients
               were allocated to either the four-week physiotherapy program or
               management as directed by their general practitioners. The
               dependent variables of interest were pain and disability.
               Assessors were blind to treatment group. Outcome data from 49
               subjects (86\%) showed a significant treatment effect. The
               physiotherapy program reduced pain and disability by a mean of
               1.5/10 points on a numerical rating scale (95\% CI 0.7 to 2.3)
               and 3.9 points on the 18-point Roland Morris Disability

               needed to treat in order to gain a clinically meaningful change
               was 3 (95\% CI 3 to 8) for pain, and 2 (95\% CI 2 to 5) for

               review was to investigate the effectiveness of workplace-based
               interventions for neck pain in office workers. Data
               Sources:MEDLINE, PEDro, CINAHL, and CENTRAL were searched for
               trials published since inception and before May 31, 2016. Study
               Selection:Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were considered
               when they met the following criteria: population consisted of
               office workers, intervention(s) was performed at the workplace,
               outcome measures included neck and/or neck/shoulder pain
               intensity and incidence/prevalence, and comparator groups
               included no/other intervention. Data Extraction:Data were
               extracted by 1 reviewer using predefined data fields and checked
               by a second reviewer. Risk of bias was assessed by 2 independent
               reviewers using the 2015 Cochrane Back and Neck Group
               guidelines. Evidence quality was evaluated using the Grading of
               Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system.
               Data Synthesis:Twenty-seven RCTs were included. There was
               moderate-quality evidence that neck/shoulder strengthening
               exercises and general fitness training were effective in
               reducing neck pain in office workers who were symptomatic,
               although the effect size was larger for strengthening exercises.
               Greater effects were observed with greater participation in
               exercise. Ergonomic interventions were supported by low-quality
               evidence. Limitations:Data could not be obtained from some
               studies for meta-analysis and assessment of risk of bias.
               Reporting bias might have been present because only studies in
               the English language were included. Conclusions:Workplace-based
               strengthening exercises were effective in reducing neck pain in
               office workers who were symptomatic, and the effect size was
               larger when the exercises were targeted to the neck/shoulder.
               Future RCTs of ergonomic interventions targeted at office
               workers who are symptomatic are required. More research on neck
               pain prevention is warranted.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:This correlational study describes
               factors that are related to patient compliance with exercise
               regimens during physical therapy. We investigated whether
               patient compliance was related to characteristics of the patient
               or the patient's illness, to the patient's attitude, or to the
               physical therapist's behavior. SUBJECTS AND METHODS:Of a random
               sample of 300 physical therapists in private practice in the
               Netherlands, 222 therapists responded to a questionnaire survey.
               Eighty-four respondents also made audio recordings. Materials of
               the study were 1,931 registration forms, 1,837 audio-recorded
               sessions of physical therapy sessions, and 1,681 patient
               questionnaires. RESULTS:The results show that the three main
               factors related to noncompliance were (1) the barriers patients
               perceive and encounter, (2) the lack of positive feedback, and
               (3) the degree of helplessness. The first factor, the barriers
               patients perceive and encounter, shows the strongest relation
               with noncompliance. The results also show that noncompliance is
               more strongly related to the characteristics of the illness than
               to the illness, a bad prognosis is negatively related to
               compliance, and much hindrance of the complaint is positively
               related to compliance. There was no difference between men and
               women with regard to patient compliance, but less educated
               patients were slightly more compliant than more highly educated
               patients. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION:These correlational findings
               can be used to formulate hypotheses of cause and effect in
               future clinical research. Future research should take into
               account the type and efficacy of therapeutic exercise for
               different diseases. For physical therapy practice, it seems
               important that physical therapists carefully explore which
               problems patients encounter in their efforts to comply and that
               they seek solutions to those problems in mutual cooperation with
               their patients.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE:The purpose of this article is to review the literature
              that discusses normal anatomy and biomechanics of the foot and
              ankle, mechanisms that may result in a lateral ankle sprain or
              syndesmotic sprain, and assessment and diagnostic procedures, and
              to present a treatment algorithm based on normal ligament healing
              principles. METHODS:Literature was searched for years 2000 to
              2010 in PubMed and CINAHL. Key search terms were ankle sprain\$,
              ankle injury and ankle injuries, inversion injury,
              proprioception, rehabilitation, physical therapy, anterior
              talofibular ligament, syndesmosis, syndesmotic injury, and
              ligament healing. DISCUSSION:Most ankle sprains respond favorably
              to nonsurgical treatment, such as those offered by physical
              therapists, doctors of chiropractic, and rehabilitation
              specialists. A comprehensive history and examination aid in
              diagnosing the severity and type of ankle sprain. Based on the
              diagnosis and an understanding of ligament healing properties, a
              progressive treatment regimen can be developed. During the acute
              inflammatory phase, the goal of care is to reduce inflammation
              and pain and to protect the ligament from further injury. During
              the reparative and remodeling phase, the goal is to progress the
              rehabilitation appropriately to facilitate healing and restore
              the mechanical strength and proprioception. Radiographic imaging
              techniques may need to be used to rule out fractures, complete
              ligament tears, or instability of the ankle mortise. A period of
              immobilization and ambulating with crutches in a nonweightbearing
              gait may be necessary to allow for proper ligament healing before
              commencing a more active treatment approach. Surgery should be
              considered in the case of grade 3 syndesmotic sprain injuries or
              those ankle sprains that are recalcitrant to conservative care.
              CONCLUSION:An accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment can
              minimize an athlete's time lost from sport and prevent future
              reinjury. Most ankle sprains can be successfully managed using a
              nonsurgical approach.",

              and capsuloligamentous stability, depends upon the proprioceptive
              and stabilizing capabilities of musculotendinous structures more
              than any other joint in the human body. The purpose of this
              review is to compare the morphology, histology, and sensorimotor
              functional relationships of the human glenohumeral joint with the
              more abundant animal research data. From a synthesis of this
              information, a proprioceptive and stability alliance is proposed
              for the human glenohumeral joint which is initiated by
              mechanoreceptor activation from capsuloligamentous and
              musculotendinous structures, resulting in reflex-mediated
              protective muscular responses that are ultimately under the bias

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: It has been reported that manipulative therapy
               directed at the cervical and thoracic spine may improve outcomes
               in patients with shoulder pain. To date, limited data are
               available to help physical therapists determine which patients
               with shoulder pain may experience changes in pain and disability
               following the application of these interventions. OBJECTIVE: The
               purpose of this study was to identify prognostic factors from
               the history and physical examination in individuals with
               shoulder pain who are likely to experience rapid improvement in
               pain and disability following cervical and thoracic spine
               manipulation. DESIGN: This was a prospective single-arm trial.
               SETTING: This study was conducted in outpatient physical therapy
               clinics. PARTICIPANTS: The participants were individuals who
               were seen by physical therapists for a primary complaint of
               shoulder pain. INTERVENTION AND MEASUREMENTS: Participants
               underwent a standardized examination and then a series of thrust
               and nonthrust manipulations directed toward the cervicothoracic
               spine. Individuals were classified as having achieved a
               successful outcome at the second and third sessions based on
               their perceived recovery. Potential prognostic variables were
               entered into a stepwise logistic regression model to determine
               the most accurate set of variables for prediction of treatment
               success. RESULTS: Data for 80 individuals were included in the
               data analysis, of which 49 had a successful outcome. Five
               prognostic variables were retained in the final regression
               model. If 3 of the 5 variables were present, the chance of
               achieving a successful outcome improved from 61\% to 89\%
               (positive likelihood ratio=5.3). LIMITATIONS: A prospective
               single-arm trial lacking a control group does not allow for
               inferences to be made regarding cause and effect. The
               statistical procedures used may result in ``overfitting'' of the
               model, which can result in low precision of the prediction
               accuracy, and the bivariate analysis may have resulted in the
               rejection of some important variables. CONCLUSIONS: The
               identified prognostic variables will allow clinicians to make an
               a priori identification of individuals with shoulder pain who
               are likely to experience short-term improvement with cervical
               and thoracic spine manipulation. Future studies are necessary to
               validate these findings.",

              and lower extremity position or movement during eight variations
              of a scapular retraction exercise. DESIGN:Descriptive study.
              Exercise performance was standardized and individualized based on
              height, age and body weight. METHODS:Individual muscle activation
              was captured by surface electromyography in thirty young healthy
              overhead athletes. Exercises were performed in front of a pulley
              apparatus. RESULTS:The mean values for upper trapezius and lower
              trapezius were 6.59\% and 15.93\% of maximum voluntary isometric
              contractions respectively. Main effects were found for
              ``exercise'' (F=2.60; p=0.037) and ``muscle part'' (F=25.44;
              p<0.001) in an ANOVA for repeated measures model showing higher
              lower trapezius muscle activation compared to the upper trapezius
              across exercises. An unipodal squat position on the contralateral
              leg increased trapezius muscle activation by 3.93\% maximum
              voluntary isometric contraction (p=0.019) compared to the
              conventional seated performance of the exercise. No differences
              between phases were found and no exercise activated a particular
              muscle part (upper trapezius or lower trapezius) to a greater
              extent in comparison with other exercises since no two-way
              interactions were found with p<0.05. CONCLUSIONS:All exercise
              variations may be useful in the early phases of scapular
              rehabilitation training because of their favorable trapezius
              muscle balance activation. Standing in a squat position on the
              contralateral leg can result in a slight increase in trapezius
              muscle activation. However, future comparative effectiveness
              studies are needed to identify the long-term training benefits of
              these exercises.",

  abstract  = "In patients with non-specific arm pain (NSAP; also known as
               repetitive strain injury), there are clinical signs of altered
               median nerve sliding. It is possible that a restriction along
               the nerve course will lead to abnormal increases in local strain
               during limb movements, possibly contributing to symptoms. The
               present study uses ultrasound imaging to examine median nerve
               sliding through the proximal and distal nerve segments in 18
               NSAP patients. Longitudinal nerve sliding was measured during
               metacarpophalangeal, wrist and elbow movements. During elbow
               movements, the angle of elbow extension at which the nerve
               begins to move was determined, since this was expected to
               decrease with a restriction through the shoulder. The results
               from this study were compared with previously reported data.
               Nerve movements ranged from 1.26 to 4.73 mm in patients compared
               with 1.43-5.57 mm in controls. There was no significant
               difference in nerve sliding (p>0.05) or in the angle of elbow
               extension at which the nerve began to move (mean=53.4 degrees in
               patients, 52.0 degrees in controls; p>0.05). In summary,
               restriction of median nerve sliding is unlikely to play a major
               role in NSAP. Therefore, painful responses during limb movements
               which tension the nerve are unlikely to result from abnormal
               increases in nerve strain.",

  abstract  = "We present a treatment-based classification approach to the
               conservative management of low back syndrome. The approach has
               three levels of classification based on historical information,
               behavior of symptoms, and clinical signs. We first distinguish
               patients whose conservative care can be managed predominantly
               and independently by physical therapists versus patients who
               require consultation with other services (eg, psychology) or who
               require referral because of possible serious nonmusculoskeletal
               pathology. Once patients who can be managed by physical
               therapists are identified, the next level of classification is
               to stage their condition with regard to severity. We propose
               three stages: stage I for patients in the acute phase where the
               therapeutic goal is symptom relief, stage II for patients in a
               subacute phase where symptom relief and quick return to normal
               function are encouraged, and stage III for selected patients who
               must return to activities requiring high physical demands and
               who demonstrate a lack of physical conditioning necessary to
               perform the desired activities safely. The remainder of the
               article focuses on a third level of classification for stage I
               only in which patients are classified into distinct categories
               that are treatment-based and that specifically guide
               conservative management. The entire approach is diagnosis based,

               education by spine surgeons in the United States for patients
               with lumbar radiculopathy. METHODS:An online cross-sectional
               survey was used to study a random sample of spine surgeons in
               the United States. The Spinal Surgery Education Questionnaire
               (SSEQ) was developed based on previous related surveys and
               assessed for face and content validity by an expert panel. The
               SSEQ captured information on demographics, content, delivery
               methods, utilization, and importance of preoperative education
               as rated by surgeons. Descriptive statistics were used to
               describe the current utilization, importance, content, and
               delivery methods of preoperative education by spine surgeons in
               the United States for patients with lumbar radiculopathy.
               RESULTS:Of 200 surgeons, 89 (45\% response rate) responded to
               the online survey. The majority (64.2\%) provide preoperative
               education informally during the course of clinical consultation
               versus a formal preoperative education session. The mean time
               from the decision to undergo surgery to the date of surgery was
               33.65 days. The highest rated educational topics are surgical
               procedure (96.3\%), complications (96.3\%),
               outcomes/expectations (93.8\%), anatomy (92.6\%), amount of
               postoperative pain expected (90.1\%), and hospital stay
               (90.1\%). Surgeons estimated spending approximately 20\% of the
               preoperative education time specifically addressing pain.
               Seventy-five percent of the surgeons personally provide the
               education, and nearly all surgeons (96.3\%) use verbal
               communication with the use of a spine model. CONCLUSIONS:Spine
               surgeons believe that preoperative education is important and
               use a predominantly biomedical approach in preparing patients
               for surgery. Larger studies are needed to validate these

               availability of TNE to pain patients in remote areas. A
               32-year-old patient with chronic low back pain (CLBP) who
               underwent surgery for thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) attended a
               single clinic one-on-one TNE session followed by TNE via
               electronic mail (e-mail), pacing and graded exposure over a
               4-month period. A physical examination, Numeric Rating Scale
               (NRS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), the Disabilities of Arm,
               Shoulder and Hand (DASH), and Fear-Avoidance Beliefs

               physical therapist-guided aerobic exercise in a randomized
               controlled trial. All participants were diagnosed with major
               depression according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
               Mental Disorders. Data were collected and analyzed in an
               inductive manner using qualitative content analysis according to
               Graneheim and Lundman. RESULTS:Four categories emerged: (1)
               struggling toward a healthy self, (2) challenging the
               resistance, (3) feeling alive but not euphoric, and (4) needing
               someone to be there for you. The participants experienced that
               although the exercise intervention was hard work, it enhanced
               the feeling of being alive and made them feel that they were
               doing something good for themselves. These feelings were a
               welcome contrast to the numbness and stagnation they experienced
               during depression. LIMITATIONS:The study was conducted in
               Swedish primary care. Transferability of results must be viewed
               in relation to context. CONCLUSIONS:Exercise in a physical
               therapy context can improve the patients' perception of their
               physical ability and create a sense of liveliness, improving
               their depressed state. The therapeutic relationship is essential
               for supporting the patient's vulnerability and ambiguity in an
               empathic and perceptive way.",

              analyze the association between low back pain and biomedical
              beliefs in physiotherapy students of the first and last year.
              SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:There is a hypothesis that the
              presence of low back pain may be a risk factor for biomedical
              beliefs in physiotherapy academics. METHODS:Three hundred
              sixty-five students of first and last year of the physiotherapy
              course from three universities in city of Fortaleza completed a
              questionnaire with sociodemographic factors and a Pain Attitude
              and Beliefs Scale used to determine the orientation
              (biopsychosocial or biomedical approach) of practitioners to the
              management of people with low back pain. RESULTS:The mean age of
              participants was 23.57 $\pm$ 4.77 years, with a predominance of
              females (80.27\%, n = 239). Approximately 23.84\% reported low
              back pain, 18.9\% had undergone imaging tests at the site, and
              36.71\% reported that family members with low back pain also
              underwent these examinations. The means of the biopsychosocial
              subscale of the Pain Attitude and Belief Scale corresponded to
              20.19 and 20.63 in the first and last year academics,
              respectively, whereas the biomedical subscale corresponded to
              32.10 and 32.73 in the first and last year academics,
              respectively. There was no statistical difference between the
              scores of the first and last year students. Linear regression
              analyses showed that low back pain was associated with lower
              levels of biomedical beliefs in the students of the last year
              (beta coefficient = -2.17, 95\% confidence interval = -3.95 to
              -0.3, P = 0.02). We did not find association between low back
              pain and levels of biomedical beliefs in academics of both years
              and with academics of the first year. Also, we did not find
              association between low back pain and levels of biopsychosocial
              beliefs. CONCLUSION:First and last year physical therapy students
              did not present a difference between biomedical and
              biopsychosocial beliefs. Although biomedical beliefs were
              prevalent in both groups, the academics of the last year who had
              low back pain presented lower levels of biomedical beliefs than
              the academics of the last year without low back symptoms. LEVEL

              Healthcare system, January 2007 to December 2014. Background
              Recent evolutions in health care delivery are putting physical
              therapists in the forefront to be more responsible for providing
              high-quality rehabilitation care in a more cost-effective manner.
              Studies investigating the association between physical therapy
              visit utilization and outcomes in vulnerable patient populations
              following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction may
              provide useful insights. Objectives To examine the relationship
              between patient age, sex, physical therapy visit utilization, and
              physical therapy intervention charges with revision rates and
              patient-reported outcomes in individuals following primary ACL
              reconstruction. Methods A sample of 660 patients who had an ACL
              reconstruction was identified through an electronic medical
              record database. Age and physical therapy visit utilization were
              categorized to examine effects between groups (20 years of age or
              younger, 21 to 34 years of age, 35 years of age or older; fewer
              than 9 visits, 9 to 14 visits, 15 or more visits). Multilevel
              mixed-effects linear models were conducted to compare differences
              between revision rates and patient-reported outcomes during the
              episode of care. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses
              were also used to determine visit-number and charge-per-visit cut
              points to discriminate patients who achieved at least a minimal
              clinically important difference on the patient-reported outcomes.
              Results Of 660 patients, 22 (3.3\%) had revision surgery.
              Compared with patients 20 years and younger, the incidence rate
              ratio of ACL reconstruction revision was lower in patients who
              were 35 years and older (85\%) and 21 to 34 years (59\%). Of 470
              patients who attended physical therapy for longer than 3 months,
              change in Knee Outcome Survey activities of daily living subscale
              score was significantly lower among patients 20 years of age and
              younger and in the lowest visit category. Conclusion Achievement
              of favorable outcomes following ACL reconstruction may require
              categorization of patients beyond surgical diagnosis alone.
              Younger patients (aged 20 years or less) attending fewer physical
              therapy visits (fewer than 9) were more likely to have ACL
              revision surgery and had inferior patient-reported outcomes
              compared to older patients and those with higher physical therapy

  abstract = "BACKGROUND:Back pain is a common disorder that has a tendency to
              recur. It is unclear if exercises, either as part of treatment or
              as a post-treatment programme, can reduce back pain recurrences.
              OBJECTIVES:To investigate the effectiveness of exercises for
              preventing new episodes of low-back pain or low-back
              pain-associated disability. SEARCH STRATEGY:We searched CENTRAL
              (The Cochrane Library 2009, issue 3), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL
              up to July 2009. SELECTION CRITERIA:Inclusion criteria were:
              participants who had experienced back pain before, an
              intervention that consisted of exercises without additional
              specific treatment and outcomes that measured recurrence of back
              pain or time to recurrence. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:Two
              review authors independently judged if references met the
              inclusion criteria. The same review authors independently
              extracted data and judged the risk of bias of the studies.
              Studies were divided into post-treatment intervention programmes
              and treatment studies. Study results were pooled with
              meta-analyses if participants, interventions, controls and
              outcomes were judged to be sufficiently homogenous. MAIN
              RESULTS:We included 13 articles reporting on nine studies with
              nine interventions. Four studies with 407 participants evaluated
              post-treatment programmes and five studies with 1113 participants
              evaluated exercise as a treatment modality. Four studies had a
              low risk of bias, one study a high risk and the remainder an
              unclear risk of bias.We found moderate quality evidence that
              post-treatment exercises were more effective than no intervention
              for reducing the rate of recurrences at one year (Rate Ratio
              0.50; 95\% Confidence Interval 0.34 to 0.73). There was moderate
              quality evidence that the number of recurrences was significantly
              reduced in two studies (Mean Difference -0.35; 95\% CI -0.60 to
              -0.10) at one-half to two years follow-up. There was very low
              quality evidence that the days on sick leave were reduced by
              post-treatment exercises (Mean Difference -4.37; 95\% CI -7.74 to
              -0.99) at one-half to two years follow-up.We found conflicting
              evidence for the effectiveness of exercise treatment in reducing
              the number of recurrences or the recurrence rate. AUTHORS'
              CONCLUSIONS:There is moderate quality evidence that
              post-treatment exercise programmes can prevent recurrences of
              back pain but conflicting evidence was found for treatment
              exercise. Studies into the validity of measurement of recurrences
              and the effectiveness of post-treatment exercise are needed.",

              prospectively evaluated 48 patients with a clinical suspicion of
              thoracic outlet syndrome. Standardized provocative tests, an
              electromyogram and somatosensory evoked responses, a Doppler

              investigation and the final diagnosis was evaluated.
              RESULTS:Provocative tests had mean sensitivity and specificity
              values of 72\% and 53\%, respectively, with better values for the
              Adson test (positive predictive value [PPV], 85\%), the

              association between the rates of advanced spinal imaging and
              spine surgery across geographic areas. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND
              DATA:The rates of spine surgery in the United States have
              increased along with a concurrent rise in the use of advanced
              spinal imaging: CT and MRI. Spine surgery rates vary six-fold
              across geographic areas of the United States. Differences in
              patient populations and health care supply have explained only
              about 10\% of this variation. METHODS:We used a random 5\% sample
              of Medicare's National Claims History Part B files for 1996 and
              1997 to determine procedure rates across 306 Hospital Referral
              Regions. We analyzed the association between spinal imaging and
              spine surgery using linear regression. Main outcome measures were
              rates of procedures and coefficients of determination (R2).
              RESULTS:The rates of advanced spinal imaging (CT and MRI
              combined) varied 5.5-fold across geographic areas. Areas with
              higher rates of MRI had higher rates of spine surgery overall (r
              = 0.46) and spinal stenosis surgery specifically (r = 0.37). The
              rates of advanced spinal imaging accounted for 22\% of the
              variability in overall spine surgery rates (R2 = 0.22, P < 0.001)
              and 14\% of the variability in lumbar stenosis surgery rates (R2
              = 0.14, P < 0.001). A simulation model showed that MRIs obtained
              in the patients undergoing surgery accounted for only a small
              part of the correlation between MRI and total spine surgery
              rates. CONCLUSIONS:A significant proportion of the variation in
              rates of spine surgery can be explained by differences in the
              rates of advanced spinal imaging. The indications for advanced
              spinal imaging are not firmly agreed on, and the appropriateness
              of many of these imaging studies has been questioned. Improved
              consensus on the use and interpretation of advanced spinal
              imaging studies could have an important effect on variation in
              spine surgery rates.",

              role of information is crucial, especially in conditions where
              self-management is considered an integral part of care. However,
              the suitability and applicability of much patient information has
              not been appraised in terms of how far it meets patients'
              information needs. AIMS: To ascertain patients' and clinicians'
              experiences and expectations of information in low back pain in
              order to suggest a suitable 'patient-centred' content for a
              patient information pack to be used in a primary care setting.
              METHODS: A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews
              with General Practitioners (GPs) (n = 15) and focus groups
              comprising patients with low back pain (n = 37). RESULTS:
              Barriers to information-giving for low back pain in primary care
              exist. Patients are dissatisfied with the information they
              receive from their GPs, especially regarding diagnosis and
              treatment. Patients tend to access information from a variety of
              other sources, which is often contradictory, conflicts with
              research evidence and leads to unreasonable expectations. GPs
              have varying views regarding the value of patient information and
              are equivocal about their roles as information providers.
              Although The Back Book is generally acceptable as a patient
              information leaflet for low back pain, attention to the tone of
              the text is required. CONCLUSIONS: Barriers exist to patient
              information provision, both generally and for low back pain,
              which need to be addressed in order to close the gap between
              strategy and implementation. Improving clinician communication
              skills and involving patients in developing information materials
              which meet their needs are crucial to this process.",

              Questionnaire (FABQ), Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia 11-item

              concurrent validity of therapist ratings of perceived patient

              activity and harm, with clinical measures of fear-avoidance
              (FABQ, TSK-11, PCS), pain intensity as assessed with a numeric
              pain rating scale (NPRS), and disability as assessed with the
              Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODQ). BACKGROUND:The need to
              consider psychosocial factors for identifying patients at risk
              for disability and chronic low back pain has been well
              documented. Yet the ability of physical therapists to identify
              fear-avoidance beliefs using direct observation has not been
              studied. METHODS:Eight physical therapists and 80 patients with
              low back pain from 3 physical therapy clinics participated in the
              study. Patients completed the FABQ, TSK-11, PCS, ODQ, NPRS, and a
              dichotomous 2-item fear-avoidance screening questionnaire.
              Following the initial evaluation, physical therapists rated
              perceived patient fear-avoidance on a 0-to-10 scale and recorded
              2 influences on their ratings. Spearman correlation and
              independent t tests determined the level of association of
              therapist 0-to-10 ratings and 2-item screening with
              fear-avoidance and clinical measures. RESULTS:Therapist ratings
              of perceived patient fear-avoidance had fair to moderate
              interrater reliability (ICC2,1 = 0.663). Therapist ratings did
              not strongly correlate with FABQ or TSK-11 scores. Instead, they
              unexpectedly had stronger associations with ODQ and PCS scores.
              Both 2-item screening questions were associated with
              FABQ-physical activity scores, while the fear of physical
              activity question was also associated with FABQ-work, TSK-11,
              PCS, and ODQ scores. CONCLUSION:Therapists' ratings of perceived
              patient fear-avoidance were not associated with self-reported
              fear-avoidance scores, showing a potential disconnect between
              therapist judgments and commonly used fear-avoidance measures.
              Instead, therapist ratings had small but statistically
              significant correlations with pain catastrophizing and
              disability, findings that may support therapists' inability to
              discriminate fear-avoidance from these other factors. The 2-item

  abstract = "BACKGROUND:Identifying risk factors for the development of
              post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is important for
              understanding and ultimately preventing the disorder. This study
              assessed pain shortly after traumatic injury (i.e. peritraumatic
              pain) as a risk factor for PTSD. METHOD:Participants (n=115) were
              patients admitted to a Level 1 Surgical Trauma Center. Admission
              to this service reflected a severe physical injury requiring
              specialized, emergent trauma care. Participants completed a pain
              questionnaire within 48 h of traumatic injury and a PTSD
              diagnostic module 4 and 8 months later. RESULTS:Peritraumatic
              pain was associated with an increased risk of PTSD, even after
              controlling for a number of other significant risk factors other
              than acute stress disorder symptoms. An increase of 0.5 s.d. from
              the mean in a 0-10 pain rating scale 24-48 h after injury was
              associated with an increased odds of PTSD at 4 months by more
              than fivefold, and at 8 months by almost sevenfold. A single item
              regarding amount of pain at the time of hospital admission
              correctly classified 65\% of participants. CONCLUSIONS:If these
              findings are replicated in other samples, high levels of
              peritraumatic pain could be used to identify individuals at
              elevated risk for PTSD following traumatic injury.",

              posturing of the head and frequently is associated with neck
              pain. Disability and social withdrawal are common. In recent
              years, Botulinum toxin Type A (BtA) has become the first line
              therapy. However its true efficacy, in particular the potential
              effect size, is still unclear. OBJECTIVES:To determine whether
              botulinum toxin (BtA) is an effective and safe treatment for
              cervical dystonia. SEARCH STRATEGY:We searched the Cochrane
              Movement Disorders Group trials register (June 2003), the
              Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane
              Library Issue 3, 2003, MEDLINE (1977 to June 2003), EMBASE (1977
              to June 2003) and reference lists of articles. We also contacted
              drug manufacturers and researchers in the field. SELECTION
              CRITERIA:Randomised studies comparing BtA with placebo in adults
              with cervical dystonia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:Two
              reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted
              data. Study authors were contacted for additional information.
              Adverse effects information was collected from the trials. MAIN
              RESULTS:We found thirteen high quality eligible studies. They
              were short term (6 to 16 weeks). Eight trials, enrolling 361
              patients, used the BtA formulation Botox(r) and five, enrolling
              319 patients, used the BtA formulation Dysport. The dose and
              technique of administration varied significantly between
              studies.Meta-analysis showed statistically and clinically
              significant improvements on objective rating scales: (Peto OR
              4.31; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.68 to 6.94) and subjective
              rating scales (Peto OR 6.58; 95\% CI 4.55 to 9.54); and for pain
              relief in subjective scales (Peto OR 11.92; 95\% CI 6.32 to
              22.5). However, for many of the outcomes, we could use data from
              only a few studies. Only adverse events clearly associated with
              the mechanism of action of BtA were more frequent in the
              treatment group. These included neck weakness, dysphagia, dry
              mouth/sore throat and voice changes/hoarseness. Sub-group and
              sensitivity analyses showed a clear dose-response relationship
              for subjective and objective benefit and for frequency and
              severity of adverse events. Indirect comparisons between trials
              that used Dysport against placebo and trials that used Botox
              against placebo showed no significant differences between Dysport
              and Botox in terms of benefits or adverse events. AUTHORS'
              CONCLUSIONS:A single injection cycle of BtA is effective and safe
              for treating cervical dystonia. Enriched trials (using patients
              previously treated with BtA), suggest that further injection
              cycles continue to work for most patients.",

              MEDLINE, MANTIS, Science Direct, Index to Chiropractic
              Literature, and PEDro from March 2008 to May 2011. Inclusion
              criteria required peripheral diagnosis and MT with or without
              adjunctive care. Clinical trials were assessed for quality using
              a modified Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN)
              ranking system. RESULTS:In addition to the citations used in a
              2009 systematic review, an additional 399 new citations were

              short-term treatment of metatarsalgia and hallux limitus/rigidus
              and for loss of foot and/or ankle proprioception and balance.
              Finally, there is a level of I (insufficient evidence) for

              outcomes of patients with low back pain receiving treatments
              matched or unmatched to their subgrouping based on initial
              clinical presentation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Patients with
              ``nonspecific'' low back pain are often viewed as a homogeneous
              group, equally likely to respond to any particular intervention.
              Others have proposed methods for subgrouping patients as a means
              for determining the treatment most likely to benefit patients
              with particular characteristics. METHODS: Patients with low back
              pain of less than 90 days' duration referred to physical therapy
              were examined before treatment and classified into one of three
              subgroups based on the type of treatment believed most likely to
              benefit the patient (manipulation, stabilization exercise, or
              specific exercise). Patients were randomly assigned to receive
              manipulation, stabilization exercises, or specific exercise
              treatment during a 4-week treatment period. Disability was
              assessed in the short-term (4 weeks) and long-term (1 year) using
              the Oswestry. Comparisons were made between patients receiving
              treatment matched to their subgroup, versus those receiving
              unmatched treatment. RESULTS: A total of 123 patients
              participated (mean age, 37.7 +/- 10.7 years; 45\% female).
              Patients receiving matched treatments experienced greater short-
              and long-term reductions in disability than those receiving
              unmatched treatments. After 4 weeks, the difference favoring the
              matched treatment group was 6.6 Oswestry points (95\% CI,
              0.70-12.5), and at long-term follow-up the difference was 8.3
              points (95\% CI, 2.5-14.1). Compliers-only analysis of long-term
              outcomes yielded a similar result. CONCLUSIONS: Nonspecific low
              back pain should not be viewed as a homogenous condition.
              Outcomes can be improved when subgrouping is used to guide
              treatment decision-making.",

              into four groups: manipulative therapy group, exercise therapy
              group, combined therapy group, and a control group. The primary
              outcome was a change in headache frequency. Other outcomes
              included changes in headache intensity and duration, the
              Northwick Park Neck Pain Index, medication intake, and patient
              satisfaction. Physical outcomes included pain on neck movement,
              upper cervical joint tenderness, a craniocervical flexion muscle
              test, and a photographic measure of posture. RESULTS:There were
              no differences in headache-related and demographic
              characteristics between the groups at baseline. The loss to
              follow-up evaluation was 3.5\%. At the 12-month follow-up
              assessment, both manipulative therapy and specific exercise had
              significantly reduced headache frequency and intensity, and the
              neck pain and effects were maintained (P < 0.05 for all). The
              combined therapies was not significantly superior to either
              therapy alone, but 10\% more patients gained relief with the
              combination. Effect sizes were at least moderate and clinically
              relevant. CONCLUSION:Manipulative therapy and exercise can reduce
              the symptoms of cervicogenic headache, and the effects are
              maintained.",

  abstract  = "Background:Physical therapy is an important treatment option for
               patients with low back pain (LBP). However, whether to refer
               patients for physical therapy and the timing of initiation
               remain controversial. Objective:The objective of this study was
               to evaluate the impact of receiving physical therapy and the
               timing of physical therapy initiation on downstream health care
               utilization and costs among patients with acute LBP. Design:The
               design was a retrospective cohort study. Methods:Patients who
               had a new onset of LBP between January 1, 2009, and December 31,
               2013, in New York State were identified and grouped into
               different cohorts on the basis of whether they received physical
               therapy and the timing of physical therapy initiation. The
               probability of service use and LBP-related health care costs
               over a 1-year period were analyzed. Results:Among 46,914
               patients with acute LBP, 40,246 patients did not receive
               physical therapy and 6668 patients received physical therapy
               initiated at different times. After controlling for patient
               characteristics and adjusting for treatment selection bias,
               health care utilization and cost measures over the 1-year period
               were the lowest among patients not receiving physical therapy,
               followed by patients with immediate physical therapy initiation
               (within 3 days), with some exceptions. Among patients receiving
               physical therapy, those receiving physical therapy within 3 days
               were consistently associated with the lowest health care
               utilization and cost measures. Limitations:This study was based
               on commercial insurance claims data from 1 state.
               Conclusions:When referral for physical therapy is warranted for
               patients with acute LBP, immediate referral and initiation
               (within 3 days) may lead to lower health care utilization and

  abstract = "BACKGROUND:The purpose of this report is to provide a succinct
              but comprehensive summary of the scientific evidence regarding
              the effectiveness of manual treatment for the management of a
              variety of musculoskeletal and non-musculoskeletal conditions.
              METHODS:The conclusions are based on the results of systematic
              reviews of randomized clinical trials (RCTs), widely accepted and
              primarily UK and United States evidence-based clinical
              guidelines, plus the results of all RCTs not yet included in the
              first three categories. The strength/quality of the evidence
              regarding effectiveness was based on an adapted version of the
              grading system developed by the US Preventive Services Task Force
              and a study risk of bias assessment tool for the recent RCTs.
              RESULTS:By September 2009, 26 categories of conditions were
              located containing RCT evidence for the use of manual therapy: 13
              musculoskeletal conditions, four types of chronic headache and
              nine non-musculoskeletal conditions. We identified 49 recent
              relevant systematic reviews and 16 evidence-based clinical
              guidelines plus an additional 46 RCTs not yet included in
              systematic reviews and guidelines.Additionally, brief references
              are made to other effective non-pharmacological, non-invasive
              physical treatments. CONCLUSIONS:Spinal manipulation/mobilization
              is effective in adults for: acute, subacute, and chronic low back
              pain; migraine and cervicogenic headache; cervicogenic dizziness;
              manipulation/mobilization is effective for several extremity
              joint conditions; and thoracic manipulation/mobilization is
              effective for acute/subacute neck pain. The evidence is
              inconclusive for cervical manipulation/mobilization alone for
              neck pain of any duration, and for manipulation/mobilization for
              mid back pain, sciatica, tension-type headache, coccydynia,
              temporomandibular joint disorders, fibromyalgia, premenstrual
              syndrome, and pneumonia in older adults. Spinal manipulation is
              not effective for asthma and dysmenorrhea when compared to sham
              manipulation, or for Stage 1 hypertension when added to an
              antihypertensive diet. In children, the evidence is inconclusive
              regarding the effectiveness for otitis media and enuresis, and it
              is not effective for infantile colic and asthma when compared to
              sham manipulation.Massage is effective in adults for chronic low
              back pain and chronic neck pain. The evidence is inconclusive for
              knee osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, myofascial pain syndrome,
              migraine headache, and premenstrual syndrome. In children, the
              evidence is inconclusive for asthma and infantile colic.",

              an inflammatory disorder of unknown origin, involves different
              osseous sites and may be associated with palmoplantar pustulosis.
              Bacterial cultures of affected tissue were reported negative in
              nearly all cases. Radiological and magnetic resonance imaging
              features of CRMO have been described, but differential diagnosis
              remains difficult, including rheumatic diseases, bacterial
              osteomyelitis, and malignancy. Although definite diagnosis relies
              on histopathologic confirmation by biopsy, histopathologic
              criteria have not been defined. Because CRMO may be treated with
              nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, but not antibiotics,
              distinguishing CRMO from bacterial osteomyelitis is of major
              importance. Histopathologic analysis of 12 patients with CRMO
              indicated a wide variation of reparative changes of bone, but
              chronic inflammation could not be found at all sites in the same
              biopsy. The inflammatory infiltrate was mostly scattered,
              consisting mainly of lymphocytes, plasma cells, histiocytes, and
              also few neutrophil granulocytes. Immunohistochemistry showed a
              predominance of CD3(+), CD45RO(+) T-cells, which were mainly
              CD8(+). In addition, CD20(+) B cells and CD68(+) macrophages were
              abundant in each biopsy specimen. Mild lymphocytic and
              granulocytic infiltrates were also detected in three synovial
              biopsy specimens obtained from adjacent joints. All bacterial and
              fungal cultures from native biopsy tissues were negative.
              Amplification of partial-length 16S ribosomal DNA by polymerase
              chain reaction (PCR) using broad-range eubacterial primers was
              below the detection limit in all patients. Because
              histopathologic features alone may not provide conclusive
              evidence, CRMO should be included in the differential diagnosis
              of chronic inflammatory bone lesions in children, and the
              definite diagnosis should be made by the clinical picture, x-ray
              studies, bone scan, bacterial culture, and histopathologic
              analysis in a multidisciplinary approach.",

              the lumbar spine and hip while putting on a sock. OBJECTIVES:To
              examine differences in kinematics and coordination of the lumbar
              and hip movements in subjects with and without subacute low back
              pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:There is no information on the
              coordination of movements of lumbar spine and hips during
              activities of daily living such as putting on a sock. The effect
              of low back pain, with or without nerve root signs, is unknown.
              METHODS:A real-time three-dimensional electromagnetic tracking
              device was used to measure movements of the lumbar spine and hips
              in 60 subacute low back pain subjects with or without straight
              leg raise (SLR) signs and 20 asymptomatic subjects. Movement
              coordination between the two regions was examined by
              cross-correlation. RESULTS:Mobility was significantly reduced in
              back pain subjects. Symptomatic subjects compensated for limited
              motion through various strategies, but in all cases the
              contribution of the lumbar spine relative to that of the hip was
              significantly reduced. The lumbar spine-hip joint coordination
              was substantially altered in back pain subjects, in particular,
              when putting on a sock on the side with positive SLR sign.
              CONCLUSION:Changes in the lumbar and hip kinematics when putting
              on a sock were related to back pain and limitation in SLR. Low
              back pain will affect lumbar-hip coordination.",

              in the acetabulum. OBJECTIVE:To quantify PA glide of the femoral
              head in the acetabulum in a cadaveric sample.
              BACKGROUND:Posterior-anterior glide of the femoral head within
              the acetabulum is a joint mobilization procedure described in
              orthopaedic physical therapy texts, yet there is no published
              evidence that the joint structures of the hip allow such
              movement. This study attempted to quantify PA glide of the
              femoral head in the hip joints of embalmed cadavers.
              METHODS:Twelve hips, 3 male and 9 female, from 8 embalmed
              cadavers were employed in this study. Hips were dissected to the
              level of the joint capsule and a metal rod inserted through the
              femoral neck served as a mobilizing handle. A load cell was
              installed into this handle so that mobilizing forces could be
              monitored. A dial gauge, which recorded displacement of the
              femoral head, was mounted to the pelvis via bone pins and an
              external fixator. RESULTS:Using mobilizing forces of 89, 178,
              267, and 356 N, mean femoral head displacements of 0.57, 0.93,
              1.20, and 1.52 mm were recorded. Within the 89-N trials, PA
              displacement ranged from a minimum of 0.04 mm to a maximum of
              1.54 mm. Within the 356-N trials, PA displacement of the femoral
              head ranged from a minimum of 0.25 mm to a maximum of 2.90 mm.
              CONCLUSION:In an embalmed cadaveric model, measurable PA glide of
              the femoral head within the acetabulum does exist and it is
              highly variable between individuals.",

               al. (Lethem J, Slade PD, Troup JDG, Bentley G. Outline of
               fear-avoidance model of exaggerated pain perceptions. Behav Res

               model. The central concept of their model is fear of pain.
               'Confrontation' and 'avoidance' are postulated as the two
               extreme responses to this fear, of which the former leads to the
               reduction of fear over time. The latter, however, leads to the
               maintenance or exacerbation of fear, possibly generating a
               phobic state. In the last decade, an increasing number of
               investigations have corroborated and refined the fear-avoidance
               model. The aim of this paper is to review the existing evidence
               for the mediating role of pain-related fear, and its immediate
               and long-term consequences in the initiation and maintenance of
               chronic pain disability. We first highlight possible precursors
               of pain-related fear including the role negative appraisal of
               internal and external stimuli, negative affectivity and anxiety
               sensitivity may play. Subsequently, a number of fear-related
               processes will be discussed including escape and avoidance
               behaviors resulting in poor behavioral performance,
               hypervigilance to internal and external illness information,
               muscular reactivity, and physical disuse in terms of
               deconditioning and guarded movement. We also review the
               available assessment methods for the quantification of
               pain-related fear and avoidance. Finally, we discuss the
               implications of the recent findings for the prevention and
               treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Although there are
               still a number of unresolved issues which merit future research
               attention, pain-related fear and avoidance appear to be an
               essential feature of the development of a chronic problem for a

               magnetic resonance imaging scans during performance of a
               voluntary trunk muscle task under three conditions: directly
               after training in the task and, after one week of practice,
               before and after a 2.5 hour pain physiology education session.
               Before education there was widespread brain activity during
               performance of the task, including activity in cortical regions
               known to be involved in pain, although the task was not painful.
               After education widespread activity was absent so that there was

               The results suggest that pain physiology education markedly

              Background The gluteus medius (GMed) and gluteus minimus (GMin)
              provide dynamic stability of the hip joint and pelvis. These
              muscles are susceptible to atrophy and injury in individuals
              during menopause, aging, and disease. Numerous studies have
              reported on the ability of exercises to elicit high levels of
              GMed activity; however, few studies have differentiated between
              the portions of the GMed, and none have examined the GMin.
              Objectives To quantify and rank the level of muscle activity of
              the 2 segments of the GMin (anterior and posterior fibers) and 3
              segments of the GMed (anterior, middle, and posterior fibers)
              during 4 isometric and 3 dynamic exercises in a group of healthy,
              postmenopausal women. Methods Intramuscular electrodes were
              inserted into each segment of the GMed and GMin in 10 healthy,
              postmenopausal women. Participants completed 7 gluteal
              rehabilitation exercises, and average normalized muscle activity
              was used to rank the exercises from highest to lowest. Results
              The isometric standing hip hitch with contralateral hip swing was
              the highest-ranked exercise for all muscle segments except the
              anterior GMin, where it was ranked second. The highest-ranked
              dynamic exercise for all muscle segments was the dip test.
              Conclusion The hip hitch and its variations maximally activate
              the GMed and GMin muscle segments, and may be useful in hip

               (NP) refers to pain attributable to the activation of the
               peripheral receptive terminals of primary afferent neurones in
               response to noxious chemical, mechanical or thermal stimuli. The
               symptoms and signs associated with clinical classifications of

               was to identify symptoms and signs associated with a clinical
               classification of NP in patients with low back ($\pm$ leg) pain.
               Using a cross-sectional, between-subjects design; four hundred
               and sixty-four patients with low back ($\pm$ leg) pain were
               assessed using a standardised assessment protocol after which
               their pain was assigned a mechanisms-based classification based
               on experienced clinical judgement. Clinicians then completed a
               clinical criteria checklist indicating the presence/absence of
               various symptoms and signs. A regression analysis identified a
               cluster of seven clinical criteria predictive of NP, including:
               'Pain localised to the area of injury/dysfunction', 'Clear,
               proportionate mechanical/anatomical nature to aggravating and
               easing factors', 'Usually intermittent and sharp with
               movement/mechanical provocation; may be a more constant dull
               ache or throb at rest', and the absence of 'Pain in association
               with other dysesthesias', 'Night pain/disturbed sleep',
               'Antalgic postures/movement patterns' and 'Pain variously
               described as burning, shooting, sharp or electric-shock-like'.
               This cluster was found to have high levels of classification
               accuracy (sensitivity 90.9\%, 95\% CI: 86.6-94.1; specificity
               91.0\%, 95\% CI: 86.1-94.6). Pattern recognition of this
               empirically-derived cluster of symptoms and signs may help

               decrease the disability associated with osteoarthritis and the
               need for more invasive treatments. OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the
               effectiveness of physical therapy for osteoarthritis of the
               knee, applied by experienced physical therapists with formal
               training in manual therapy. DESIGN:Randomized, controlled
               clinical trial. SETTING:Outpatient physical therapy department
               of a large military medical center. PATIENTS:83 patients with
               osteoarthritis of the knee who were randomly assigned to receive
               treatment (n = 42; 15 men and 27 women [mean age, 60 +/- 11
               years]) or placebo (n = 41; 19 men and 22 women [mean age, 62
               +/- 10 years]). INTERVENTION:The treatment group received manual
               therapy, applied to the knee as well as to the lumbar spine,
               hip, and ankle as required, and performed a standardized knee
               exercise program in the clinic and at home. The placebo group
               had subtherapeutic ultrasound to the knee at an intensity of 0.1
               W/cm2 with a 10\% pulsed mode. Both groups were treated at the
               clinic twice weekly for 4 weeks. MEASUREMENTS:Distance walked in
               6 minutes and sum of the function, pain, and stiffness subscores
               of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis
               Index (WOMAC). A tester who was blinded to group assignment made
               group comparisons at the initial visit (before initiation of
               treatment), 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 1 year. RESULTS:Clinically and
               statistically significant improvements in 6-minute walk distance
               and WOMAC score at 4 weeks and 8 weeks were seen in the
               treatment group but not the placebo group. By 8 weeks, average
               6-minute walk distances had improved by 13.1\% and WOMAC scores
               had improved by 55.8\% over baseline values in the treatment
               group (P < 0.05). After controlling for potential confounding
               variables, the average distance walked in 6 minutes at 8 weeks
               among patients in the treatment group was 170 m (95\% CI, 71 to
               270 m) more than that in the placebo group and the average WOMAC
               scores were 599 mm higher (95\% CI, 197 to 1002 mm). At 1 year,
               patients in the treatment group had clinically and statistically
               significant gains over baseline WOMAC scores and walking
               distance; 20\% of patients in the placebo group and 5\% of
               patients in the treatment group had undergone knee arthroplasty.
               CONCLUSIONS:A combination of manual physical therapy and
               supervised exercise yields functional benefits for patients with

              of several other conditions in CR's differential diagnosis. One
              condition that may mimic CR, which is not well known amongst
              physical therapists, is Parsonage-Turner syndrome (PTS). PTS is
              characterized by an onset of intense pain that typically subsides
              within days to weeks. However, as pain subsides, weakness and/or
              paralysis may develop in upper extremity muscles. The purpose of
              this resident's case problem is to describe a patient who
              presented to our clinic with a diagnosis of CR, but had findings
              consistent with PTS. DIAGNOSIS:The patient was a 43-year-old male
              referred to physical therapy with a diagnosis of CR. He had a
              previous episode of CR 1 year ago that was treated successfully.
              He had positive magnetic resonance imaging findings of structural
              abnormalities suggestive of causative factors for CR. The patient
              was treated for CR with thoracic and cervical spine manipulations
              and intermittent cervical traction. The initial acute severe pain
              subsided, but weakness in the upper extremity worsened. Diagnosis
              of PTS was made upon exclusion of other potential confounding
              diagnoses and the findings of fibrillation potentials and
              positive waves in electrodiagnostic studies. DISCUSSION:CR and
              PTS are characterized by pain in the cervical spine, shoulder,
              and upper extremity. CR generally has an insidious onset, while
              PTS has a rapid onset of intense pain. Symptoms of CR are
              exacerbated with neck movements, while symptoms related to PTS
              should not be exacerbated with neck movements. In patients that
              do not respond to conventional therapy and have a progression of
              upper extremity muscle weakness, regardless of decreased pain,
              the diagnosis of PTS should be considered.",

              therapies, still survives in some parts of Finland and was
              compared with a light exercise therapy and non-manipulative,
              pragmatic physiotherapy in a year-long randomized controlled
              trial on patients with long-term back pain. METHODS:One hundred
              fourteen ambulatory patients of working age with back pain for 7
              weeks or more were randomly assigned to the therapies, which were
              offered in up to 10 sessions during a 6-week treatment period.
              The outcome was measured by the Oswestry Disability
              Questionnaire. Sick-leaves and visits to health centers were
              recorded for 1 year before and after the therapy. RESULTS:The
              Oswestry disability scores improved most in the bone-setting
              group (P =.02, Kruskall-Wallis test). Visits to health centers
              for back pain were reduced only in the physiotherapy group (P
              =.01, Wilcoxon test). Sick-leaves were not significantly
              different between groups. A secondary analysis based on the use
              of additional therapies after the intervention showed a possible
              subgroup with an enhanced effect from bone-setting.
              CONCLUSIONS:Traditional bone-setting seemed more effective than

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES:Persistent pain and psychological sequelae are common
              after motor vehicle collision (MVC), but their etiology remains
              poorly understood. Such common sequelae include
              whiplash-associated disorders (WAD), fibromyalgia, and
              posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Increasing evidence
              suggests that these disorders share overlapping epidemiologic and
              clinical features. A model is proposed in which central
              neurobiological systems, including physiologic systems and
              neuroanatomical structures involved in the stress response, are
              an important substrate for the development of all 3 disorders and
              interact with psychosocial and other factors to influence chronic
              symptom development. METHODS:Epidemiologic and clinical
              characteristics regarding the development of these disorders
              after MVC are reviewed. Evidence suggesting a role for stress
              response systems in the development of these disorders is
              presented. RESULTS:Contemporary evidence supports a model of
              chronic symptom development that incorporates the potential for
              interactions between past experience, acute stress responses to
              trauma, post-MVC behavior, and cognitive/psychosocial
              consequences to alter activity within brain regions which process
              pain and to result in persistent pain, as well as psychological
              sequelae, after MVC. Such a model incorporates factors identified
              in prior biopsychosocial theories and places them in the
              landscape of our rapidly developing understanding of stress
              systems and CNS pain-modulating pathways. CONCLUSION:New models
              are needed to stimulate deeper examination of the interacting
              influences of initial tissue damage, acute pain, psychosocial
              contingencies, and central stress pathways during chronic symptom
              development after MVC. Deeper understanding could contribute to
              improved treatment approaches to reduce the immense personal and

              remains unclear; however, patients typically demonstrate a
              characteristic history, clinical presentation, and recovery. A
              classification schema is described, in which primary frozen
              shoulder and idiopathic adhesive capsulitis are considered
              identical and not associated with a systemic condition or history
              of injury. Secondary frozen shoulder is defined by 3
              subcategories: systemic, extrinsic, and intrinsic. We also
              propose another classification system based on the patient's
              irritability level (low, moderate, and high), that we believe is
              helpful when making clinical decisions regarding rehabilitation
              intervention. Nonoperative interventions include patient
              education, modalities, stretching exercises, joint mobilization,

              corticosteroid injections, exercise, and joint mobilization all

              is strong evidence that glenohumeral intra-articular
              corticosteroid injections have a significantly greater 4- to
              6-week beneficial effect compared to other forms of treatment. A
              rehabilitation model based on evidence and intervention
              strategies matched with irritability levels is proposed. Exercise
              and manual techniques are progressed as the patient's

              significant pain relief, improved satisfaction, and return of
              functional motion. Patients who do not respond or worsen should
              be referred for an intra-articular corticosteroid injection.

              normal shoulders, and to identify exercises that meet a cut point
              of 15\% maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) or less
              and are unlikely to result in excessive loading in the early
              postoperative stages. Methods An electronic search of MEDLINE via
              Ovid, Embase, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, PubMed, and the Cochrane
              Library for all years up to June 2016 was performed. Studies were
              selected in relation to predefined selection criteria. Pooled
              mean MVICs were reported and classified as low (0\%-15\% MVIC),
              low to moderate (16\%-20\% MVIC), moderate (21\%-40\% MVIC), high
              (41\%-60\% MVIC), and very high (greater than 60\% MVIC). Results
              A search identified 2159 studies. After applying the selection
              criteria, 20 studies were included for quality assessment, data
              extraction, and data synthesis. In total, 43 exercises spanning
              passive range of motion, active-assisted range of motion, and
              strengthening exercises were evaluated. Out of 13 active-assisted
              exercises, 9 were identified as suitable (15\% MVIC or less) to
              load the supraspinatus and 10 as suitable to load the
              infraspinatus early after surgery. All exercises were placed in a

               were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups to complete a 12-week
               program of: (1) orthoses wear and stretching (O group); (2)
               orthoses wear, stretching, and concentric progressive resistive
               exercise (OC group); or (3) orthoses wear, stretching, and
               eccentric progressive resistive exercise (OE group).
               Pre-intervention and post-intervention data (Foot Functional
               Index, distance traveled in the 5-Minute Walk Test, and pain
               immediately after the 5-Minute Walk Test) were collected.
               RESULTS: Foot Functional Index scores (total, pain, and
               disability) decreased in all groups after the intervention. The
               OE group demonstrated the most improvement in each subcategory,
               and the O group demonstrated the least improvement. Pain
               immediately after the 5-Minute Walk Test was significantly
               reduced across all groups after the intervention. DISCUSSION AND
               CONCLUSION: People with early stages of tibialis posterior
               tendinopathy benefited from a program of orthoses wear and
               stretching. Eccentric and concentric progressive resistive
               exercises further reduced pain and improved perceptions of
               function.",

              preoperative pain neuroscience education (NE) for lumbar
              radiculopathy. OBJECTIVE:To determine if the addition of NE to
              usual preoperative education would result in superior outcomes
              with regard to pain, function, surgical experience, and health
              care utilization postsurgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:One in 4
              patients after lumbar surgery (LS) for radiculopathy experience
              persistent pain and disability, which is nonresponsive to
              perioperative treatments. NE focusing on the neurophysiology of
              pain has been shown to decrease pain and disability in
              populations with chronic low back pain. METHODS:Eligible patients
              scheduled for LS for radiculopathy were randomized to receive
              either preoperative usual care (UC) or a combination of UC plus 1
              session of NE delivered by a physical therapist (verbal
              one-on-one format) and a NE booklet. Sixty-seven patients
              completed the following outcomes prior to LS (baseline), and 1,
              3, 6, and 12 months after LS: low back pain (numeric rating
              scale), leg pain (numeric rating scale), function (Oswestry
              Disability Index), various beliefs and experiences related to LS
              (10-item survey with Likert scale responses), and postoperative
              utilization of health care (utilization of health care
              questionnaire). RESULTS:At 1-year follow-up, there were no
              statistical differences between the experimental and control
              groups with regard to primary outcome measure of low back pain (P
              = 0.183), leg pain (P = 0.075), and function (P = 0.365). In a
              majority of the categories regarding surgical experience, the NE
              group scored significantly better: better prepared for LS (P =
              0.001); preoperative session preparing them for LS (P < 0.001)
              and LS meeting their expectations (P = 0.021). Health care
              utilization post-LS also favored the NE group (P = 0.007)
              resulting in 45\% less health care expenditure compared with the
              control group in the 1-year follow-up period. CONCLUSION:NE
              resulted in significant behavior change. Despite a similar pain
              and functional trajectory during the 1-year trial, patients with
              LS who received NE viewed their surgical experience more
              favorably and used less health care facility in the form of
              medical tests and treatments. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:2.",

  abstract = "[Purpose] This study examined the differences in the activities
              of three parts of the trapezius muscle-the upper trapezius (UT),
              middle trapezius (MT), and lower trapezius (LT)-among three
              different rotation conditions of the shoulders, while subjects
              performed prone horizontal abduction (PHA) at 30°, 60°, 90°, and
              120° of abduction. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects of this
              experimental study were 16 healthy male adults. Surface
              electromyography was used to collect data on the activity of each
              part of the trapezius. A two-way analysis of variance was used to
              compare the activities of each area of the trapezius-the UT, MT,
              and LT-among internal rotation (IR), the neutral position (NP),
              and external rotation (ER) of the shoulders during PHA with
              shoulder abduction of 30°, 60°, 90°, and 120°. [Results] Activity
              of the UT, MT, and LT significantly increased as the shoulder
              abduction angle increased during PHA. There was a significant
              difference only in the activity of the LT, with change in
              shoulder rotation. In addition, the muscle activity of the LT was
              highest during shoulder IR at 120°. [Conclusion] Although
              activity of the LT was the highest during IR at 120 abduction,
              PHA accompanied by ER at an abduction angle of 120° would be
              effective at eliciting high activity in the LT when PHA is
              performed. Nonetheless, at an early stage of rehabilitation, PHA
              accompanied by ER at low abduction angles of 30° and 60° would be
              desirable to elicit low activity of the UT and high activity of
              the LT.",

  abstract  = "STUDY DESIGN: Prospective randomized comparison of 2
               rehabilitation programs. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this
               study were to compare the effectiveness of 2 rehabilitation
               programs for acute hamstring strain by evaluating time needed to
               return to sports and reinjury rate during the first 2 weeks and
               the first year after return to sport. A third objective was to
               investigate the relationship between functional testing
               performance and time to return to sports and reinjury rates
               after return to sport. BACKGROUND: Hamstring muscle strains are
               common in sports and often result in chronic pain, recurrent
               hamstring strains, and reduced sports performance. Current
               rehabilitation programs are primarily developed anecdotally and
               lack support from prospective, randomized research. METHODS AND
               MEASURES: Twenty-four athletes with an acute hamstring strain
               were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 rehabilitation groups. Eleven
               athletes were assigned to a protocol consisting of static
               stretching, isolated progressive hamstring resistance exercise,
               and icing (STST group). Thirteen athletes were assigned to a
               program consisting of progressive agility and trunk
               stabilization exercises and icing (PATS group). The number of
               days for full return to sports, injury recurrence within the
               first 2 weeks, injury recurrence within the first year of
               returning to sports, and lower-extremity functional evaluations
               were collected for all subjects and compared between groups.
               RESULTS: The average (+/- SD) time required to return to sports
               for athletes in the STST group was 37.4 +/- 27.6 days, while the
               average time for athletes in the PATS group was 22.2 +/- 8.3
               days. This difference was not statistically significant (P =
               .2455). In the first 2 weeks after return to sports, reinjury
               rate was significantly greater (P = .00343, Fisher's exact test)
               in the STST group, where 6 of 11 athletes (54.5\%) suffered a
               recurrent hamstring strain after completing the stretching and
               strengthening program, as compared to none of the 13 athletes
               (0\%) in the PATS group. After 1 year of return to sports,
               reinjury rate was significantly greater (P = .0059, Fisher's
               exact test) in the STST group. Seven of 10 athletes (70\%) who
               completed the hamstring stretching and strengthening program, as
               compared to only 1 of the 13 athletes (7.7\%) who completed the
               progressive agility and trunk stabilization program, suffered a
               recurrent hamstring strain during that 1-year period.
               CONCLUSIONS: A rehabilitation program consisting of progressive
               agility and trunk stabilization exercises is more effective than
               a program emphasizing isolated hamstring stretching and
               strengthening in promoting return to sports and preventing
               injury recurrence in athletes suffering an acute hamstring
               strain. Future randomized clinical trials should investigate the
               potential for progressive agility and trunk stabilization
               programs in the prevention of hamstring strain injury during
               sports.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE:The purpose of this prospective case series was to
              describe the outcome of a set of patients with plantar fasciitis
              treated with Graston Instrument Soft Tissue Mobilization
              techniques (GT) and a home stretching program. METHODS:Ten
              patients with a primary report of plantar heel pain completed
              self-report questionnaires including the Global Rating of Change
              Scale (GRC), the Numeric Pain Rating Scale, and the Lower
              Extremity Functional Scale. Patients were treated with GT
              directed to the triceps surae, soleus, plantar fascia, and medial
              calcaneal tubercle. Participants received a maximum of 8
              treatments over a time frame ranging from 3 to 8 weeks at a
              frequency of 1 to 2 sessions per week. Each patient was
              instructed to perform the stretching program at home 3 times
              daily. Patients completed all outcome measures at baseline, sixth
              visit (GRC), and at discharge or the eighth visit. The number of
              successful outcomes on the GRC was examined using a binomial
              test. Dependent t tests were used to examine if a significant
              difference existed in secondary outcome measures of pain and
              function. RESULTS:The subjects had a mean duration of symptoms of
              32.4 weeks (SD, 31.1). Patients were treated for an average of
              6.9 visits (SD, 1.3). There was a statistically significant
              difference between the number of patients who did and did not
              achieve a successful outcome (P = .047). There was also a
              significant improvement from baseline to follow-up for the
              Numeric Pain Rating Scale (P = .002) and Lower Extremity
              Functional Scale (P = .017). CONCLUSIONS:The group of patients
              selected for this case series who were treated with GT and home
              stretching experienced clinically meaningful improvement.",

               psychophysical problem of pain. They are located in the brain
               and spinal cord and are becoming increasingly recognised as
               playing a major role in the generation and maintenance of pain
               and disability associated with neuromusculoskeletal problems.
               Central mechanisms participate in all pain states, acute and
               chronic. They are universally influenced by psychological and
               physical factors, whether or not a specific pathology can be
               identified. Misconceptions are that manual therapy operates on
               peripheral mechanisms without influencing the central ones and
               that when a central problem exists, psychological management is
               preferable. In reality, as key players in the healing process,
               central mechanisms are profoundly affected by manual therapy
               even when it is directed at a peripheral problem. Treatment of
               peripheral mechanisms can be performed through central
               techniques because both peripheral and central mechanisms are
               always part of the same clinical problem. Consequently, manual
               therapy must change its mindset from a peripheral standpoint and
               integrate central mechanisms into clinical practice as a means
               of improving therapeutic efficacy and to prevent the descent of

               factors for cardiovascular disease and premature mortality.
               Early detection and effective management of HTN have
               demonstrated significant reductions in mortality, morbidity
               rate, and health care costs. Furthermore, screening for HTN by
               nonphysician health care providers improves detection rates and
               medical management. As physical therapist practice advances to a
               more independent care model, physical therapists may serve as
               the first point of contact into the health care system, thereby
               necessitating a need for routine blood pressure (BP) monitoring.
               This is especially relevant in the outpatient physical therapist
               practice setting, where there is evidence for elevated BP
               measures among patients, yet omission of routine screening in
               this setting is well documented. Leading physical therapy
               professional organizations include statements in their
               guidelines that suggest that physical therapists have a duty to
               provide a standard of care that protects the safety and
               optimizes the overall health of patients under their care.
               Therefore, it is imperative not only that physical therapists
               include BP examination into routine practice protocols but that
               the knowledge and skills to accurately measure and interpret BP
               at rest and during exercise be integrated into the standard of
               care. The authors suggest that the profession of physical
               therapy proactively embrace their potential to address the
               national and worldwide HTN epidemic through routine assessment
               of BP, appropriate referral for elevated BP measures, and
               exploration of HTN management by physical therapists.",

  abstract = "STUDY DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. OBJECTIVE: To assess the
              effectiveness of manual physical therapy and exercise (MTE) for
              mechanical neck pain with or without unilateral upper extremity
              (UE) symptoms, as compared to a minimal intervention (MIN)
              approach. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Mounting evidence supports
              the use of manual therapy and exercise for mechanical neck pain,
              but no studies have directly assessed its effectiveness for UE
              symptoms. METHODS: A total of 94 patients referred to 3 physical
              therapy clinics with a primary complaint of mechanical neck pain,
              with or without unilateral UE symptoms, were randomized to
              receive MTE or a MIN approach of advice, motion exercise, and
              subtherapeutic ultrasound. Primary outcomes were the neck
              disability index, cervical and UE pain visual analog scales
              (VAS), and patient-perceived global rating of change assessed at
              3-, 6-, and 52-weeks. Secondary measures included treatment
              success rates and post-treatment healthcare utilization. RESULTS:
              The MTE group demonstrated significantly larger reductions in
              short- and long-term neck disability index scores (mean 1-year
              difference -5.1, 95\% confidence intervals (CI) -8.1 to -2.1; P =
              0.001) and short-term cervical VAS scores (mean 6-week difference
              -14.2, 95\% CI -22.7 to -5.6; P = 0.001) as compared to the MIN
              group. The MTE group also demonstrated significant within group
              reductions in short- and long-term UE VAS scores at all time
              periods (mean 1-year difference -16.3, 95\% CI -23.1 to -9.5; P =
              0.000). At 1-year, patient perceived treatment success was
              reported by 62\% (29 of 47) of the MTE group and 32\% (15 of 47)
              of the MIN group (P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: An impairment-based MTE
              program resulted in clinically and statistically significant
              short- and long-term improvements in pain, disability, and
              patient-perceived recovery in patients with mechanical neck pain

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND:The underlying causes of spinal manipulation
               hypoalgesia are largely unknown. The beneficial clinical effects
               were originally theorized to be due to biomechanical changes,
               but recent research has suggested spinal manipulation may have a
               direct neurophysiological effect on pain perception through
               dorsal horn inhibition. This study added to this literature by
               investigating whether spinal manipulation hypoalgesia was: a)
               local to anatomical areas innervated by the lumbar spine; b)
               correlated with psychological variables; c) greater than
               hypoalgesia from physical activity; and d) different for A-delta
               and C-fiber mediated pain perception. METHODS:Asymptomatic
               subjects (n = 60) completed baseline psychological
               questionnaires and underwent thermal quantitative sensory
               testing for A-delta and C-fiber mediated pain perception.
               Subjects were then randomized to ride a stationary bicycle,
               perform lumbar extension exercise, or receive spinal
               manipulation. Quantitative sensory testing was repeated 5
               minutes after the intervention period. Data were analyzed with
               repeated measures ANOVA and post-hoc testing was performed with
               Bonferroni correction, as appropriate. RESULTS:Subjects in the
               three intervention groups did not differ on baseline
               characteristics. Hypoalgesia from spinal manipulation was
               observed in lumbar innervated areas, but not control (cervical
               innervated) areas. Hypoalgesic response was not strongly
               correlated with psychological variables. Spinal manipulation
               hypoalgesia for A-delta fiber mediated pain perception did not
               differ from stationary bicycle and lumbar extension (p > 0.05).
               Spinal manipulation hypoalgesia for C-fiber mediated pain
               perception was greater than stationary bicycle riding (p =
               0.040), but not for lumbar extension (p = 0.105).
               CONCLUSION:Local dorsal horn mediated inhibition of C-fiber
               input is a potential hypoalgesic mechanism of spinal
               manipulation for asymptomatic subjects, but further study is
               required to replicate this finding in subjects with low back
               pain.",

              muscles in 10 cadaveric specimens to understand their functional
              design. Based on our data and previously published joint
              angle-muscle excursion data, sarcomere length operating ranges
              were modeled through all permutations in 75 masculine medial and
              lateral rotation and 75 masculine abduction at the glenohumeral
              joint. Based on physiologic cross-sectional area, the
              subscapularis would have the greatest force-producing capacity,
              followed by the infraspinatus, supraspinatus, and teres minor.
              Based on fiber length, the supraspinatus would operate over the
              widest range of sarcomere lengths. The supraspinatus and
              infraspinatus had relatively long sarcomere lengths in the
              anatomic position, and were under relatively high passive
              tensions at rest, indicating they are responsible for
              glenohumeral resting stability. However, the subscapularis
              contributed passive tension at maximum abduction and lateral
              rotation, indicating it plays a critical role in glenohumeral
              stability in the position of apprehension. These data illustrate
              the exquisite coupling of muscle architecture and joint
              mechanics, which allows the rotator cuff to produce near maximal
              active tensions in the midrange and produce passive tensions in
              the various end-range positions. During surgery relatively small
              changes to rotator cuff muscle length may result in relatively
              large changes in shoulder function.",

              nonspecific low back pain (LBP) the effectiveness of spinal
              high-velocity low-amplitude (HVLA) manipulation compared with the
              nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac and with placebo.
              SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:LBP is an important economical factor
              in all industrialized countries. Few studies have evaluated the
              effectiveness of spinal manipulation in comparison to
              nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or placebo regarding
              satisfaction and function of the patient, off-work time, and
              rescue medication. METHODS:A total of 101 patients with acute LBP
              (for <48 hr) were recruited from 5 outpatient practices,
              exclusion criteria were numerous and strict. The subjects were
              randomized to 3 groups: (1) spinal manipulation and
              placebo-diclofenac; (2) sham manipulation and diclofenac; (3)
              sham manipulation and placebo-diclofenac. Outcomes registered by
              a second and blinded investigator included self-rated physical
              disability, function (SF-12), off-work time, and rescue
              medication between baseline and 12 weeks after randomization.
              RESULTS:Thirty-seven subjects received spinal manipulation, 38
              diclofenac, and 25 no active treatment. The placebo group with a
              high number of dropouts for unsustainable pain was closed
              praecox. Comparing the 2 active arms with the placebo group the
              intervention groups were significantly superior to the control
              group. Ninety subjects were analyzed in the collective intention
              to treat. Comparing the 2 intervention groups, the manipulation
              group was significantly better than the diclofenac group
              (Mann-Whitney test: P = 0.0134). No adverse effects or harm was
              registered. CONCLUSION:In a subgroup of patients with acute
              nonspecific LBP, spinal manipulation was significantly better
              than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac and
              clinically superior to placebo.",

              effective functioning of all involved structures, including the

              extensor tendons in midline and to limit their distal excursion.
              Injury to the sagittal bands or sagittal band attenuation can
              cause instability and ulnar displacement/subluxation of the
              extensor tendons into the valleys between the digits and lead to
              a subsequent loss of active finger extension at the
              metacarpophalangeal joints. Secondary conditions may also
              develop, such as swan-neck deformity, as is frequently observed

               neuroscience education (NE) for pain, disability, anxiety, and
               stress in chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain. DATA
               SOURCES:Systematic searches were conducted on Biomed Central,
               BMJ.com, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, NLM Central Gateway,
               OVID, ProQuest (Digital Dissertations), PsycInfo,
               PubMed/Medline, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. Secondary
               searching (PEARLing) was undertaken, whereby reference lists of
               the selected articles were reviewed for additional references
               not identified in the primary search. STUDY SELECTION:All
               experimental studies including randomized controlled trials
               (RCTs), nonrandomized clinical trials, and case series
               evaluating the effect of NE on pain, disability, anxiety, and
               stress for chronic MSK pain were considered for inclusion.
               Additional limitations: studies published in English, published
               within the last 10 years, and patients older than 18 years. No
               limitations were set on specific outcome measures of pain,
               disability, anxiety, and stress. DATA EXTRACTION:Data were
               extracted using the participants, interventions, comparison, and
               outcomes (PICO) approach. DATA SYNTHESIS:Methodological quality
               was assessed by 2 reviewers using the Critical Review
               Form-Quantitative Studies. This review includes 8 studies
               comprising 6 high-quality RCTs, 1 pseudo-RCT, and 1 comparative
               study involving 401 subjects. Most articles were of good
               quality, with no studies rated as poor or fair. Heterogeneity
               across the studies with respect to participants, interventions
               evaluated, and outcome measures used prevented meta-analyses.
               Narrative synthesis of results, based on effect size,
               established compelling evidence that NE may be effective in
               reducing pain ratings, increasing function, addressing
               catastrophization, and improving movement in chronic MSK pain.
               CONCLUSIONS:For chronic MSK pain disorders, there is compelling
               evidence that an educational strategy addressing neurophysiology
               and neurobiology of pain can have a positive effect on pain,

               the passive lateral flexion was restricted in this position.

               slump test are frequently used for assessment of
               mechanosensitivity of neural tissues. However, there is ongoing
               debate in the literature regarding the contributions of neural
               and non-neural tissues to the elicited symptoms because many
               structures are affected by these tests. Sensitizing manoeuvres
               are limb or spinal movements added to neurodynamic tests, which
               aim to identify the origin of the symptoms by preferentially
               loading or unloading neural structures. A prerequisite for the
               use of sensitizing manoeuvres to identify neural involvement is
               that the addition of sensitizing manoeuvres has no impact on
               pain perception when the origin of the pain is non-neural. In
               this study, experimental muscle pain was induced by injection of
               hypertonic saline in tibialis anterior or soleus in 25
               asymptomatic, naive volunteers. A first experiment investigated
               the impact of hip adduction, abduction, medial and lateral
               rotation in the SLR position. In a second experiment, the
               different stages of the slump test were examined. The intensity
               and area of experimentally induced muscle pain did not increase
               when sensitizing manoeuvres were added to the SLR or throughout
               the successive stages of the slump test. The findings of this
               study lend support to the validity of the use of sensitizing

              randomized. Shoulder proprioception was analyzed for its
              dependence on arm dominance, direction of rotation, and muscle
              fatigue. Subjects detected external rotation after significantly
              less movement than they did internal rotation. Overall, before
              exercise, motion was detected after a mean of 0.92 degrees of
              rotation. After exercise, this threshold to detection of movement
              increased to 1.59 degrees, an increase of 73\%. This significant
              increase occurred with both internal and external rotation. The
              decrease in proprioceptive sense with muscle fatigue may play a
              role in decreasing athletic performance and in fatigue-related
              shoulder dysfunction. It remains to be determined if training can
              lessen this loss in position sense.",

              of the nation's costliest health problems, in both human and
              financial terms. The science behind smoking cessation treatment
              and promotion of treatment is strong; the cost effectiveness of
              smoking cessation treatment is among the highest in all of
              medicine, the time required before a positive return on
              investment is reasonable for employers, and the short-term costs
              of treatments are well estimated and manageable for health plans
              and employers. Armed with this business case, the PBGH
              Negotiating Alliance has expanded health insurance to include
              pharmacotherapy, over the counter or by prescription, and
              behavioral interventions. Because PBGH has been a national

              effect of even small reductions in smoking are striking, and
              unlike other chronic illnesses, nicotine addiction is curable, at
              both individual and societal levels. Thus, if employers make the

  author   = "Hahne, Andrew J and Ford, Jon J and McMeeken, Joan M",
  abstract = "STUDY DESIGN:A systematic review of randomized controlled trials.
              OBJECTIVE:To determine the efficacy and adverse effects of
              conservative treatments for people who have lumbar disc
              herniation with associated radiculopathy (LDHR). SUMMARY OF
              BACKGROUND DATA:Although conservative management is commonly used
              for people who have LDHR, the efficacy and adverse effects of
              conservative treatments for this condition are unclear.
              METHODS:We searched 10 computer databases for trials published in
              English between 1971 and 2008. Trials focusing on people with
              referred leg symptoms and radiologic confirmation of a lumbar
              disc herniation were included if at least 1 group received a
              conservative and noninjection treatment. RESULTS:Eighteen trials
              involving 1671 participants were included. Seven (39\%) trials
              were considered of high quality. Meta-analysis on 2 high-quality
              trials revealed that advice is less effective than
              microdiscectomy surgery at short-term follow-up, but equally
              effective at long-term follow-up. Individual high-quality trials
              provided moderate evidence that stabilization exercises are more
              effective than no treatment, that manipulation is more effective
              than sham manipulation for people with acute symptoms and an
              intact anulus, and that no difference exists among traction,
              laser, and ultrasound. One trial showed some additional benefit
              from adding mechanical traction to medication and electrotherapy
              methods. Adverse events were associated with traction (pain,
              anxiety, lower limb weakness, and fainting) and ibuprofen
              (gastrointestinal events). CONCLUSION:Advice is less effective
              than microdiscectomy in the short term but equally effective in
              the long term for people who have LDHR. Moderate evidence favors
              stabilization exercises over no treatment, manipulation over sham
              manipulation, and the addition of mechanical traction to
              medication and electrotherapy. There was no difference among
              traction, laser, and ultrasound. Adverse events were associated
              with traction and ibuprofen. Additional high-quality trials would
              allow firmer conclusions regarding adverse effects and efficacy.",

  author   = "Cleland, Joshua and Palmer, Jessica",
  abstract = "STUDY DESIGN:Single-case A1-B-A2 design. OBJECTIVE:To determine
              if manual physical therapy, therapeutic exercise, and patient
              education would be an effective management strategy for a patient
              with a disc displacement without reduction of both
              temporomandibular joints. BACKGROUND:A number of conservative
              management strategies have been proposed for the treatment of
              temporomandibular disorders. However, little evidence exists to
              indicate the effectiveness of physical therapy interventions in
              patients with bilateral disc displacement without reduction.
              METHODS AND MEASURES:Phase A1 of the study consisted of a
              baseline condition in which no intervention was initiated. Phase
              B included manual physical therapy, therapeutic exercise, and
              patient education focusing on the temporomandibular joint and
              cervical spine. Phase A2 consisted of withdrawal of the
              intervention. The Steigerwald/Maher disability questionnaire was
              used to collect data relative to function. A visual analog scale
              was used to collect pain data and maximal mouth opening
              measurements were obtained as an indicator of range of motion.
              Visual analysis and the 2 standard deviation band method of
              statistical analysis were used to compare data. RESULTS:Following
              the implementation of the intervention phase, the patient
              demonstrated significant reductions in pain and improvements in
              maximal mouth opening and function as measured by the
              Steigerwald/Maher disability questionnaire. These observed
              improvements were maintained at the time of a 3-month follow-up.
              CONCLUSIONS:The results of our study suggest that manual physical
              therapy, therapeutic exercise, and patient education may have
              been an effective management strategy for a patient with
              bilateral disc displacement without reduction of the
              temporomandibular joints. Further outcome studies in the form of
              randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the clinical
              utility of this treatment approach in a larger population.",

               places considerable reliance on the patient's report of pain.
               Reported pain intensity is assumed to bear a close relationship
               with underlying nociception but research has shown that the
               experience of pain is also influenced by a wide range of
               psychological factors. Firstly, response to pain provocation
               (whether palpation or induction of biomechanical stress) can be
               affected by fear of an adverse outcome (such as pain) and fear
               of injury. Secondly, a patient's global rating of their pain may
               be widely influenced by factors in addition to nociception such
               as distress, fear and mistaken beliefs about the nature of pain
               and likely outcome of treatment. The manual therapist needs,
               therefore, to conduct and understand biomedical assessment
               within a biopsychosocial framework. In appraising the patient's
               response, the therapist may find it helpful to incorporate
               specific assessment of subjectively reported fear or behavioural
               indicators of fear such as guarded movements or behavioural
               signs. Therapists need to understand that in manual therapy,
               they are frequently managing the patient's pain behaviour and

               trial was to examine the usefulness of the addition of specific
               stabilization exercises to a general back and abdominal muscle
               exercise approach for patients with subacute or chronic
               nonspecific back pain by comparing a specific muscle
               stabilization-enhanced general exercise approach with a general
               exercise-only approach. SUBJECTS:Fifty-five patients with
               recurrent, nonspecific back pain (stabilization-enhanced
               exercise group: n=29, general exercise-only group: n=26) and no
               clinical signs suggesting spinal instability were recruited.
               METHODS:Both groups received an 8-week exercise intervention and
               written advice (The Back Book). Outcome was based on
               self-reported pain (Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire),
               disability (Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire), and
               cognitive status (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, Tampa Scale
               of Kinesiophobia, Pain Locus of Control Scale) measured
               immediately before and after intervention and 3 months after the
               end of the intervention period. RESULTS:Outcome measures for
               both groups improved. Furthermore, self-reported disability
               improved more in the general exercise-only group immediately
               after intervention but not at the 3-month follow-up. There were
               generally no differences between the 2 exercise approaches for
               any of the other outcomes. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION:A general
               exercise program reduced disability in the short term to a
               greater extent than a stabilization-enhanced exercise approach
               in patients with recurrent nonspecific low back pain.
               Stabilization exercises do not appear to provide additional
               benefit to patients with subacute or chronic low back pain who
               have no clinical signs suggesting the presence of spinal
               instability.",

              psycho-educational video shown in the Emergency Department
              shortly after the injury would produce follow-up pain reductions
              and reduced medical utilization. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND
              DATA:Chronic pain following a whiplash injury is one example of
              the massive medical/legal problem of chronic muscular pain.
              Approaches using local pain sources (trigger points) have shown
              promise as treatment models for this type of pain. METHODS:1)
              SETTING: Emergency Departments (ED) and urgent care (UC)
              facilities. 2) PATIENTS: 126 patients entering EDs or UCs. 3)
              INTERVENTION: PATIENTS assigned to 12-minute video or care as
              usual. 4) MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Short Form Musculoskelatal
              Function Assessment (SMFA), phone questionnaires assessing:
              narcotics use, ER use, UC use, surgical consultations, etc.
              RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:PATIENTS viewing the video had
              dramatically lower pain ratings at a 1-month follow (6.09 [10.6]
              vs. 21.23 [17.4], P < 0.001) and this pattern held for the 3- and
              6-month follow-up period. Similarly, for 17 of 21 items asked at
              follow-up, the video group showed superior outcomes (chi2 ranged
              from 5 to 35, P < 0.05, all). For example, 4\% of video patients
              were using narcotics at 6 month post ED visit compared with 36\%
              of controls. The brief psycho-educational video had a profound
              effect on subsequent pain and medical utilization.",

  abstract = "The development of valid classification methods to assist the
              physical therapy management of patients with low back pain has
              been recognized as a research priority. There is also growing
              evidence that the use of a classification approach to physical
              therapy results in better clinical outcomes than the use of
              alternative management approaches. In 1995 Delitto and colleagues
              proposed a classification system intended to inform and direct
              the physical therapy management of patients with low back pain.
              The system described 4 classifications of patients with low back
              pain (manipulation, stabilization, specific exercise, and
              traction). Each classification could be identified by a unique
              set of examination criteria, and was associated with an
              intervention strategy believed to result in the best outcomes for
              the patient. The system was based on expert opinion and research
              evidence available at the time. A substantial amount of research
              has emerged in the years since the introduction of this
              classification system, including the development of clinical
              prediction rules, providing new evidence for the examination
              criteria used to place a patient into a classification and for
              the optimal intervention strategies for each classification. New
              evidence should continually be incorporated into existing
              classification systems. The purpose of this clinical commentary
              is to review this classification system, its evolution and

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:Clinical reasoning is essential to
               physical therapist practice. Solid clinical reasoning processes
               may lead to greater understanding of the patient condition,
               early diagnostic hypothesis development, and well-tolerated
               examination and intervention strategies, as well as mitigate the
               risk of diagnostic error. However, the complex and often
               subconscious nature of clinical reasoning can impede the
               development of this skill. Protracted tools have been published
               to help guide self-reflection on clinical reasoning but might
               not be feasible in typical clinical settings. CASE
               DESCRIPTION:This case illustrates how the Systematic Clinical
               Reasoning in Physical Therapy (SCRIPT) tool can be used to guide
               the clinical reasoning process and prompt a physical therapist
               to search the literature to answer a clinical question and
               facilitate formal mentorship sessions in postprofessional
               physical therapist training programs. OUTCOMES:The SCRIPT tool
               enabled the mentee to generate appropriate hypotheses, plan the
               examination, query the literature to answer a clinical question,
               establish a physical therapist diagnosis, and design an
               effective treatment plan. The SCRIPT tool also facilitated the
               mentee's clinical reasoning and provided the mentor insight into
               the mentee's clinical reasoning. The reliability and validity of
               the SCRIPT tool have not been formally studied.
               DISCUSSION:Clinical mentorship is a cornerstone of
               postprofessional training programs and intended to develop
               advanced clinical reasoning skills. However, clinical reasoning
               is often subconscious and, therefore, a challenging skill to
               develop. The use of a tool such as the SCRIPT may facilitate
               developing clinical reasoning skills by providing a systematic
               approach to data gathering and making clinical judgments to
               bring clinical reasoning to the conscious level, facilitate
               self-reflection, and make a mentored physical therapist's
               thought processes explicit to his or her clinical mentor.",

               vigorous exertion can trigger cardiac arrest or sudden death and
               that habitual exercise may diminish this risk. However, the role
               of physical activity in precipitating or preventing sudden death
               has not been assessed prospectively in a large number of
               subjects. METHODS:We used a prospective, nested case-crossover
               design within the Physicians' Health Study to compare the risk
               of sudden death during and up to 30 minutes after an episode of
               vigorous exertion with that during periods of lighter exertion
               or none. We then evaluated whether habitual vigorous exercise
               modified the risk of sudden death that was associated with
               vigorous exertion. In addition, the relation of vigorous
               exercise to the overall risk of sudden death and nonsudden death
               from coronary heart disease was assessed. RESULTS:During 12
               years of follow-up, 122 sudden deaths were confirmed among the
               21,481 male physicians who were initially free of self-reported
               cardiovascular disease and who provided information on their
               habitual level of exercise at base line. The relative risk
               of-sudden death during and up to 30 minutes after vigorous
               exertion was 16.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 10.5 to 27.0;
               P<0.001). However, the absolute risk of sudden death during any
               particular episode of vigorous exertion was extremely low (1
               sudden death per 1.51 million episodes of exertion). Habitual
               vigorous exercise attenuated the relative risk of sudden death
               that was associated with an episode of vigorous exertion (P
               value for trend=0.006). The base-line level of exercise was not
               associated with the overall risk of subsequent sudden death.
               CONCLUSIONS:These prospective data from a study of U.S. male
               physicians suggest that habitual vigorous exercise diminishes
               the risk of sudden death during vigorous exertion.",

              or non-augmented) or non-surgical treatment of an anterior
              cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. The subjective outcome was
              similar between the groups, with no difference regarding activity
              level and knee-injury and osteoarthritis outcome score but with a
              slightly lower Lysholm score for the non-surgically treated
              group. This difference was attributed to more instability
              symptoms. The radiological osteoarthritis (OA) frequency did not
              differ between surgically or non-surgically treated patients, but
              if a meniscectomy was performed, two-thirds of the patients
              showed OA changes regardless of initial treatment of the ACL.
              There were significantly more meniscus injuries in patients
              initially treated non-surgically. One-third of the patients in
              the non-surgically treated group underwent secondary ACL
              reconstruction due to instability problems. In this study, ACL
              repair itself could not reduce the risk of OA nor increase the
              subjective outcome scores. However, one-third of the non-surgical
              treated patients were later ACL reconstructed due to instability.
              The status of the menisci was found to be the most important
              predictor of developing OA. Early ACL repair and also ACL
              reconstruction can reduce the risk of secondary meniscus tears.
              Indirectly this supports the hypothesis that early stabilization
              of the knee after ACL injury is advantageous for the long-term
              outcome.",

               unfavourable outcome in many patients. Information on the costs
               associated with health care use and loss of productivity in
               patients with shoulder pain is very scarce. The objective of
               this study was to determine shoulder pain related costs during
               the 6 months after first consultation in general practice
               METHODS: A prospective cohort study consisting of 587 patients
               with a new episode of shoulder pain was conducted with a
               follow-up period of 6 months. Data on costs were collected by
               means of a cost diary during 6 months. RESULTS: 84\% of the
               patients completed all cost diaries. The mean consumption of
               direct health care and non-health related care was low. During 6
               months after first consultation for shoulder pain, the mean
               total costs a patient generated were 689 euro. Almost 50\% of
               this total concerned indirect costs, caused by sick leave from
               paid work. A small proportion (12\%) of the population generated
               74\% of the total costs. CONCLUSION: The total costs in the 6
               months after first consultation for shoulder pain in primary
               care, mostly generated by a small part of the population, are
               not alarmingly high.",

              challenges do practitioners face in blending clinical reasoning
              with evidence-based practice? In this article, the authors argue
              against basing clinical practice on narrow definitions of
              evidence, relying solely on experimental findings or, even more
              exclusively, on randomized controlled trials. Instead of defining
              best practice narrowly by the strength of the current empirical
              evidence used to guide clinical decisions, it should be defined
              broadly by what is the best information to use to make decisions
              for a given patient in a particular setting. Credible and
              accountable clinical decisions rely on a number of forms of
              knowledge and evidence. This evidence includes findings from
              across the range of research methods, including experimental,
              interpretive, and action research. In nursing, it also includes
              evidence that has arisen from the depth of practice knowledge of
              expert clinical nurses. Professionals, particularly advanced and
              expert clinicians such as critical care nurses, use clinical
              reasoning to guide their practice in the uncertainty of clinical
              practice contexts. This reasoning helps the nurse make judgments
              about the relevance of particular research and clinical evidence

               (TKA) in the Medicare population, little is known about the use
               of postacute physical therapy among those discharged to home.
               Objective:The objectives of this study were to explore factors
               associated with geographic variability in discharge disposition
               and outpatient physical therapy utilization for Medicare
               patients after TKA discharged to home/self-care. Design:The
               design of the study was a retrospective cohort study.
               Methods:Medicare patients with TKA discharged alive from July 1,
               2010, to June 30, 2011, with discharge disposition to
               home/self-care (HSC), home health agency (HHA), inpatient
               rehabilitation facility (IRF), or skilled nursing facility (SNF)
               were selected. Geography was measured with Census region.
               Outpatient physical therapy utilization was calculated from
               Medicare Part B claims. Odds ratios for discharge disposition
               and adjusted means for physical therapy utilization variables by
               Census region were calculated, accounting for county-clustered
               data and adjusting for demographics, clinical, and environmental
               characteristics. Results:There was significant variation with
               discharge destination by Census region among 18,278 patients.
               With discharge disposition analysis, the patients from the West
               region who were discharged home were the referent group. The
               patients from the South and Northeast regions had higher odds
               for discharge to HHAs (adjusted odds ratio [95\% CI = 1.80
               [1.48-2.19] and 2.20 [1.70-2.84]), SNFs (1.34 [1.08-1.66] and
               4.42 [3.38-5.79]), and IRFs (2.36 [1.80-3.09] and 8.83
               [6.41-12.18]). For those discharged to HSC, 40.4\% received
               outpatient physical therapy within 4 weeks. Significant
               differences were found with time to first physical therapy visit
               (Midwest <South <[West = Northeast]) and length of therapy
               episode, but not with the number of therapy visits by geographic
               region. Conclusions:Geographic region was associated with
               discharge setting, postacute physical therapy, and outpatient
               therapy utilization in Medicare beneficiaries after TKA.
               Differences in outcomes of outpatient therapy should be assessed
               to better describe the impact of geographic variation in care.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND:Population-based variations in rates of operations for
              the treatment of lumbar disc herniation and spinal stenosis are
              well known. This variability may occur in part because of
              differences in the threshold at which physicians recommend an
              operation, reflecting uncertainty about the optimum use of an
              operative procedure. To the best of our knowledge, no previous
              reports have indicated whether differences in population-based
              rates of operative treatment are associated with patient
              outcomes. METHODS:The Maine Lumbar Spine Study is an ongoing
              prospective study of 655 patients who had a herniated lumbar disc
              or spinal stenosis. The patients were enrolled by their
              physicians, who provided baseline demographic and
              treatment-related data. The patients completed baseline and
              follow-up questionnaires that focused on symptoms, function,
              satisfaction, and quality of life. Small-area variation analysis
              was used to develop three distinct so-called spine service areas
              in Maine. The outcomes (usually at four years; minimum, two
              years) were compared among these areas, in which a total of 250
              patients had been managed operatively and had answered
              questionnaires. RESULTS:Population-based rates of operative
              treatment derived from statewide data that had been collected
              over five years in the state of Maine ranged from 38 percent
              below to 72 percent above the average rate in the state (a
              greater than fourfold difference). The outcomes for the patients
              who had been managed by surgeons in the lowest-rate area were
              superior to those for the patients in the two higher-rate areas.
              Seventy-nine percent (fifty-seven) of seventy-two patients in the
              lowest-rate area had marked or complete relief of pain in the
              lower extremity compared with 60 percent (eighteen) of thirty
              patients in the highest-rate area. The improvements in the Roland
              disability score (p < or = 0.01), quality of life (p < or =
              0.01), and satisfaction (p < or = 0.05) were significantly
              greater among the patients in the lowest-rate area. The patients
              in the higher-rate areas generally had less severe symptoms and
              findings at baseline than those in the lowest-rate area did.
              CONCLUSIONS:Higher population-based rates of elective spinal
              operations may be associated with inferior outcomes. This
              variability is possibly related to differences in physicians'
              preferences with regard to recommending an operation and in their
              criteria for the selection of patients. Physicians cannot assume
              that their outcomes will be the same as those of others, and
              therefore they need to evaluate their own results.",

              cervical radiculopathy using magnetic resonance imaging.
              OBJECTIVE:The purpose of this study was to evaluate functional
              changes in the cervical intervertebral foramen during the axial
              compression test (ACT), axial distraction test (DT), and Spurling
              test (SST). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:Although alterations of
              the cross-sectional area of the cervical intervertebral foramen
              during flexion/extension and rotation have been reported, there
              are no studies that have measured functional changes in foramen
              cross-sectional area (FCSA) or shape during the simulation of
              clinical tests for cervical radiculopathy. METHODS:23
              participants (12 men, age: 24.52 years) without history of
              significant spinal disorders were studied. The 3-dimensional
              sequence of the magnetic resonance imaging of the foramen was
              performed with a 0.2-T horizontally open unit. Measurements were
              taken of FCSA and foramen shape (ratio of foramen height to
              FCSA). These measurements were conducted under 4 different
              conditions; control-resting in supine, DT-neck in neutral with a
              12 kg distraction force, ACT-neck in neutral with a 7 kg axial
              compression force, SST-the cervical spine was extended (12.79
              degrees ), rotated (63.36 degrees ), and laterally flexed (28.49
              degrees ), in a standardized manner. RESULTS:At all levels except
              for C7-Th1, the FCSA significantly increased (P 0.05) in foramen
              shape between the ACT and SST condition, but only at the C4-C5
              and C5-C6 levels. CONCLUSION:During 3 clinical tests for cervical
              radiculopathy functional, relevant, and changes in the cervical
              intervertebral foramen were evident particularly in the middle
              cervical spine.",

  abstract = "Clinical decision rules are an increasingly common presence in
              the biomedical literature and represent one strategy of enhancing
              clinical-decision making with the goal of improving the
              efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare delivery. In the
              context of rehabilitation research, clinical decision rules have
              been predominantly aimed at classifying patients by predicting
              their treatment response to specific therapies. Traditionally,
              recommendations for developing clinical decision rules propose a
              multistep process (derivation, validation, impact analysis) using
              defined methodology. Research efforts aimed at developing a
              ``diagnosis-based clinical decision rule'' have departed from
              this convention. Recent publications in this line of research
              have used the modified terminology ``diagnosis-based clinical
              decision guide.'' Modifications to terminology and methodology
              surrounding clinical decision rules can make it more difficult
              for clinicians to recognize the level of evidence associated with
              a decision rule and understand how this evidence should be
              implemented to inform patient care. We provide a brief overview
              of clinical decision rule development in the context of the

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND:Pregnancy-related low back pain and pelvic girdle
               pain (LBP/PGP) are common and negatively impact the lives of
               many pregnant women. Several patient-based outcome instruments
               measure treatment effect, but there is no consensus about which
               measure to use with women who have these pain presentations.
               OBJECTIVE:The objective was to compare the responsiveness of 3
               outcome measures in LBP/PGP: Oswestry Disability Index-version
               2.0 (ODI), Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire (PGQ), and 0 to 10
               numerical rating scale for pain severity (NRS); and to estimate
               a minimal important change (MIC) for these measures in
               pregnancy-related LBP/PGP. DESIGN:This was a methodology study
               using data from a pilot randomized controlled trial.
               METHODS:Women (N = 124) with pregnancy-related LBP/PGP were
               recruited to a pilot randomized controlled trial evaluating the
               benefit of adding acupuncture to standard care, of whom 90
               completed an 8-week follow-up. Responsiveness was evaluated by
               examining correlation between change score and the external
               anchor (6-point global perceived effect scale) and by using
               receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. MIC was
               estimated using anchor-based methods. RESULTS:All measures
               showed good responsiveness, with areas under the receiver
               operating characteristic curve ranging from 0.77 to 0.90. The
               estimated MICs were 3.1, 11.0, 9.4, 13.3, and 1.3 for the ODI,
               PGQ-total, PGQ-activity, PGQ-symptoms, and NRS, respectively.
               All the measures, apart from ODI, had MICs larger than the
               measurement error. LIMITATIONS:The lack of an optimal ``gold
               standard'' or external criterion for assessing responsiveness
               and MIC was a limitation of this study. CONCLUSION:All 3 outcome
               measures demonstrated good responsiveness. MICs were derived for
               each instrument. The PGQ at 8 weeks postrandomization was
               identified as an appropriate outcome measure for
               pregnancy-related LBP/PGP because it is specific to these pain
               presentations and assesses both activity limitations and
               symptoms. The NRS is an efficient, shorter alternative.",

              strain of cervical nerve roots C5-C8 during ULNTT with minimal
              disruption of surrounding tissues. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND
              DATA:Clinical examination of neural pathology involving cervical
              nerve roots is difficult because of the transient nature of
              pathologies, such as cervical radiculopathy, entrapment
              neuropathies, and thoracic outlet syndrome. Cadaveric studies
              have demonstrated significant displacement and strain in
              lumbosacral nerve roots during neurodynamic testing of the lower
              extremity. Examination into the biomechanical behaviors of
              cervical nerve roots during ULNTT has not been performed.
              METHODS:Eleven unembalmed cadavers were positioned supine as
              though undergoing ULNTT. Radiolucent markers were implanted into
              cervical nerve roots C5-C8. Posteroanterior fluoroscopic images
              were captured at resting and ULNTT positioning. Images were
              digitized and displacement and strain were calculated.
              RESULTS:ULNTT resulted in significant inferolateral displacement
              (average, 2.16 mm-4.32 mm, P < 0.001) of cervical nerve roots
              C5-C8. There was a significant difference in inferolateral
              displacement between the C5 and C6 nerve roots (3.15 mm vs. 4.32
              mm, P = 0.009). ULNTT resulted in significant strain (average,
              6.80\%-11.87\%, P < 0.001) of cervical nerve roots C5-C8. There
              was a significant difference in strain between the C5 and C6
              nerve roots (6.60\% vs. 11.87\%, P = 0.03). CONCLUSION:ULNTT
              caused significant inferolateral displacement and strain in
              cervical nerve roots C5-C8. These results provide the mechanical
              foundation for the use of ULNTT in clinical evaluation of
              pathology in the cervical region, such as in cervical
              radiculopathy, entrapment neuropathies, and thoracic outlet

              clinical trial was performed. OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the
              association of a patient's expectation for benefit from a
              specific treatment with improved functional outcome. SUMMARY OF
              BACKGROUND DATA:Psychosocial factors, ambiguous diagnoses, and
              lack of a clearly superior treatment have complicated the
              management of patients with chronic low back pain. The authors
              hypothesized that patient expectation for benefit from a specific
              treatment is associated with improved functional outcomes when
              that treatment is administered. METHODS:In a randomized trial,
              135 patients with chronic low back pain who received acupuncture
              or massage were studied. Before randomization, study participants
              were asked to describe their expectations regarding the
              helpfulness of each treatment on a scale of 0 to 10. The primary
              outcome was level of function at 10 weeks as measured by the
              modified Roland Disability scale. RESULTS:After adjustment for
              baseline characteristics, improved function was observed for 86\%
              of the participants with higher expectations for the treatment
              they received, as compared with 68\% of those with lower
              expectations (P = 0.01). Furthermore, patients who expected
              greater benefit from massage than from acupuncture were more
              likely to experience better outcomes with massage than with
              acupuncture, and vice versa (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS:The results
              of this study suggest that patient expectations may influence
              clinical outcome independently of the treatment itself. In
              contrast, general optimism about treatment, divorced from a
              specific treatment, is not strongly associated with outcome.
              These results may have important implications for clinical trial
              design and recruitment, and may help to explain the apparent
              success of some conventional and alternative therapies in trials
              that do not control for patient expectations. The findings also
              may be important for therapy choices made in the clinical

               proposed as performance-based outcome measures following
               anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, limited reports
               of their measurement properties exist. The purpose of this study
               was to investigate the reliability and longitudinal validity of
               data obtained from hop tests during rehabilitation after ACL
               reconstruction. SUBJECTS:Forty-two patients, 15 to 45 years of
               age, who had undergone ACL reconstruction participated in the
               study. METHODS AND MEASURES:The study design was prospective and
               observational with repeated measures. The subjects performed a
               series of 4 hop tests on 3 separate occasions within the 16th
               week following surgery and on a fourth occasion 6 weeks later.
               The tests were a single hop for distance, a 6-m timed hop, a
               triple hop for distance, and crossover hops for distance.
               Performance on the ACL-reconstructed limb was expressed as a
               percentage of the performance on the nonoperative limb, termed
               the ``limb symmetry index.'' Subjects also completed the Lower
               Extremity Functional Scale and a global rating of change
               questionnaire. RESULTS:Intraclass correlation coefficients for
               limb symmetry index values ranged from .82 to .93. Standard
               errors of measurement were 3.04\% to 5.59\%. Minimal detectable
               changes, at the 90\% confidence level, were 7.05\% to 12.96\%.
               Changes in hop test scores on the operative limb were
               statistically greater than changes on the nonoperative limb.
               Pearson correlations (r) between change in hop performances and
               self-reported measures ranged from .26 to .58. DISCUSSION AND
               CONCLUSION:The results show that the described series of hop
               tests provide a reliable and valid performance-based outcome
               measure for patients undergoing rehabilitation following ACL
               reconstruction. These findings support the use and facilitate
               the interpretation of hop tests for research and clinical

              research on accuracy of individual clinical diagnostic signs and
              tests for the presence of temporomandibular disorder (TMD), and
              for the subclassifications affiliated with TMD.
              BACKGROUND:Diagnosis of TMD through clinical diagnostic measures
              has been reported in many studies; however, few of these studies
              have identified individual clinical tests or signs that can aid
              in the diagnosis of TMD or differentiate between the
              subclassifications of TMD. METHODS:Preferred Reporting Items for
              Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were
              followed for this review. Computerized and hand searches were
              completed to locate articles on the diagnostic accuracy of
              clinical tests and signs. To be considered for review, the study
              required (1) an assessment of individual clinical measures of
              TMD, (2) a report of the diagnostic accuracy of these measures,
              and (3) an acceptable reference standard for comparison. Quality
              assessment of studies of diagnostic accuracy (QUADAS) scores were
              completed on each selected article. Sensitivity and specificity
              and negative and positive likelihood ratios were calculated for
              each diagnostic test described. RESULTS:The search strategy
              identified 131 potential articles, which were narrowed down to 7
              that met the criteria for this review. After assessment using the
              QUADAS score, 3 of the 7 articles were of high quality. All 7
              studies used tests to differentiate subclassifications of TMD.
              The 7 studies included (1) diagnostic tests/signs of joint
              sounds, (2) joint movements, or (3) clinically oriented pain
              measures. There were no studies that investigated TMD versus a
              competing, non-TMD condition. CONCLUSION:Only 3 studies presented
              in this literature review were of high quality. Because all of
              the included studies assessed diagnostic accuracy among
              subclassifications of individuals suspected of having TMD, the
              ability of any of these tests to distinguish between patients
              with TMD versus patients without TMD remains unknown. Because of
              the lack of clear findings indicating compelling evidence for
              clinical diagnosis of TMD, and because of the low quality of most
              of these studies, the data are insufficient to support or reject
              these tests. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:Diagnosis, level 2a-.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND:Few studies have investigated or identified common
               clinical tests and measures as being associated with progression
               of hip osteoarthritis (OA); fewer still are longitudinal studies
               exploring prognostic variables associated with long-term outcome
               following physical therapy treatment. OBJECTIVE:The purpose of
               this study was to determine a set of prognostic factors that
               maximize the accuracy of identifying patients with hip
               osteoarthritis (OA) likely to demonstrate a favorable response
               to physical therapy intervention. DESIGN:This was a prognostic
               study. METHODS:Ninety-one patients with a clinical diagnosis of
               hip OA were analyzed to determine which clinical measures, when
               clustered together, were most predictive of a favorable response
               to physical therapy intervention. Responders were determined
               based on OMERACT-OARSI response criteria, which included percent
               and absolute changes in pain, function, and global rating of
               change over 1 year. These data served as the reference standard
               for determining the predictive validity of baseline clinical
               examination variables. Using multivariate regression analyses
               and calculations for sensitivity, specificity, and positive and
               negative likelihood ratios, a cluster was identified.
               RESULTS:Five baseline variables (unilateral hip pain, age of
               $\leq$58 years, pain of $\geq$6/10 on a numeric pain rating
               scale, 40-m self-paced walk test time of $\leq$25.9 seconds, and
               duration of symptoms of $\leq$1 year) were retained in the final
               model. Failure to exhibit a condition of 1 of the 5 predictor
               variables decreased the posttest probability of responding
               favorably to physical therapy intervention from 32\% to <1\%
               (negative likelihood ratio=0.00, 95\% confidence
               interval=0.00-0.70). Having at least 2 out of 5 predictor
               variables at baseline increased the posttest probability of
               success with physical therapy intervention from 32\% to 65\%
               (positive likelihood ratio=3.99, 95\% confidence
               interval=2.66-4.48), and having 3 or more of 5 predictor
               variables increased the posttest probability of success to 99\%
               or higher. A comparison with a control group that did not
               receive physical therapy further substantiated the cluster.
               LIMITATIONS:The small sample size and the number of variables
               entered into the logistic regression model may have resulted in
               spurious findings. This study must be validated in replication
               studies before it can be considered for use in clinical
               practice. CONCLUSIONS:This study completed the first step in the
               development of a preliminary cluster of baseline variables that
               identify patients with hip OA as positive responders to physical
               therapy intervention.",

              treatment approach for piriformis syndrome using a hip muscle
              strengthening program with movement reeducation.
              BACKGROUND:Interventions for piriformis syndrome typically
              consist of stretching and/or soft tissue massage to the
              piriformis muscle. The premise underlying this approach is that a
              shortening or ``spasm'' of the piriformis is responsible for the
              compression placed upon the sciatic nerve. CASE DESCRIPTION:The
              patient was a 30-year-old male with right buttock and posterior
              thigh pain for 2 years. Clinical findings upon examination
              included reproduction of symptoms with palpation and stretching
              of the piriformis. Movement analysis during a single-limb
              step-down revealed excessive hip adduction and internal rotation,
              which reproduced his symptoms. Strength assessment revealed
              weakness of the right hip abductor and external rotator muscles.
              The patient's treatment was limited to hip-strengthening
              exercises and movement reeducation to correct the excessive hip
              adduction and internal rotation during functional tasks.
              OUTCOMES:Following the intervention, the patient reported 0/10
              pain with all activities. The initial Lower Extremity Functional
              Scale questionnaire score of 65/80 improved to 80/80. Lower
              extremity kinematics for peak hip adduction and internal rotation
              improved from 15.9 degrees and 12.8 degrees to 5.8 degrees and
              5.9 degrees, respectively, during a step-down task.
              DISCUSSION:This case highlights an alternative view of the
              pathomechanics of piriformis syndrome (overstretching as opposed
              to overshortening) and illustrates the need for functional
              movement analysis as part of the examination of these patients.

  abstract = "STUDY DESIGN:Case report. BACKGROUND:Differential diagnosis for
              patients with radial wrist pain requires consideration of
              systemic disease, referred pain to the radial aspect of the
              wrist, and local dysfunction. The list of possible local
              dysfunctions should include De Quervain syndrome, as well as
              entrapment neuropathy of the superficial radial nerve. CASE
              DESCRIPTION:The patient was a 57-year-old man with right radial
              wrist pain of 6 months' duration. The referral diagnosis was De
              Quervain syndrome, but a previous course of electrophysical
              agents-based physical therapy management had been unsuccessful.
              The physical examination ruled out the cervical, shoulder, elbow,
              and wrist joints as possible sources of pain. In this case, the
              diagnosis of entrapment neuropathy of the superficial radial
              nerve, rather than De Quervain syndrome, was primarily based on
              the symptom provocation resulting from a modified radial bias
              upper limb nerve tension test. Based on this diagnosis, treatment
              consisted of active and passive exercises using neurodynamic
              techniques. OUTCOMES:After 1 treatment session, the patient noted
              changes with regard to current pain intensity and function that
              exceeded the minimal clinically important difference and the
              minimal detectable change, respectively. After only 2 treatment
              sessions, the patient reported a complete resolution of symptoms
              and a full return to work. DISCUSSION:This case report critically
              evaluates the diagnostic process for patients with radial wrist
              pain and suggests neuropathy of the superficial sensory branch of
              the radial nerve as a differential diagnostic option. LEVEL OF

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND:Traction is commonly used for the treatment of low
               back pain (LBP), predominately with nerve root involvement;
               however its benefits remain to be established. The aim of this
               study was to test the feasibility of a pragmatic randomized
               controlled trial to compare the difference between two treatment
               protocols (manual therapy, exercise and advice, with or without
               traction) in the management of acute/sub acute LBP with 'nerve
               root' involvement. METHODS:30 LBP patients with nerve root pain
               were recruited and randomly assigned to one of two treatment
               groups. Primary outcome measures were the: McGill pain
               questionnaire, Roland Morris disability questionnaire, and the
               SF36 Questionnaire; recorded at baseline, discharge, 3 and 6
               months post-discharge. RESULTS:27 patients completed treatment
               with a loss of another four patients at follow up. Intention to
               treat analysis demonstrated an improvement in all outcomes at
               follow up points but there appeared to be little difference
               between the groups. CONCLUSION:This study has shown that a trial
               recruiting patients with 'nerve root' problems is feasible.
               Further research based upon a fully powered trial is required to
               ascertain if the addition of traction has any benefit in the

               Objective:The purpose of this study is to identify correlates of
               physical therapy utilization among adults with symptomatic knee
               OA. Design:The design consisted of secondary analysis using
               baseline data from a randomized controlled trial of 350 adults
               with physician-diagnosed symptomatic knee OA. Methods:Patients
               completed baseline surveys regarding demographics, pain,
               function, medical history, and prior physical therapy
               utilization for symptomatic knee OA. Multivariable logistic
               regression identified correlates of physical therapy
               utilization, with models adjusted for body mass index and age.
               Interactions of race and sex with all other characteristics were
               evaluated. Results:One hundred and eighty-one patients (52\%)
               reported prior physical therapy utilization. Factors
               independently associated with increased odds of physical therapy
               utilization were female sex (odds ratio [OR] = 3.06, 95\% CI =
               1.58-5.93), bachelor degree or higher degree (OR = 2.44, 95\% CI
               = 1.15-5.16), prior knee injury (OR = 1.86, 95\% CI =
               1.08-3.19), and duration of knee OA symptoms (OR = 2.16, 95\% CI
               = 1.09-4.29 for >5-10 years; OR = 2.11, 95\% CI = 1.10-4.04 for
               >10 years). Whites who had received a joint injection were >3
               times as likely to have utilized physical therapy (OR = 3.69,
               95\% CI = 1.94-7.01); this relationship did not exist for
               non-whites who had received joint injections. Limitations:A
               sample enrolled in an exercise study may limit generalizability.
               Self-report of physical therapy may misclassify utilization. It
               cannot be determined whether lack of utilization resulted from
               lack of referral or from patients choosing not to attend
               physical therapy. Conclusion:Physical therapy is underutilized
               to manage symptomatic knee OA. Women and those with a bachelor
               degree or higher degree, prior knee injury, and longer duration
               of knee OA symptoms were more likely to have used therapy
               previously. Differences by race in the link between joint
               injection and physical therapy utilization may reflect a reduced
               likelihood of referral and decreased use of health interventions
               for symptomatic knee OA among non-whites, or both.",

  abstract = "STUDY DESIGN:The present study was designed to characterize the
              effect of phospholipase A2 on the discharge of perispinal sensory
              nerves in the anesthetized New Zealand white rabbit.
              OBJECTIVES:To examine the effects of phospholipase A2 on the
              neural response of somatosensory neurons innervating the lumbar
              facet joint and surrounding tissues. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND
              DATA:An irritating component of disc tissue may be phospholipase
              A2, which has been found at extraordinary high levels in
              herniated and painful discs. Phospholipase A2 has been shown to
              be inflammatory, but its effect on nerve response has never been
              shown. METHODS:Surgically isolated facet joint capsules from
              rabbits were investigated by means of electrophysiologic and
              histologic techniques. Phospholipase A2 was injected into the
              characterized nerve receptive field, and responses were evaluated
              over time with varying doses. RESULTS:The injection of
              phospholipase A2 into the nerve receptive fields produced
              neurotoxicity with a 1500-U dose, sensitization of the nerves and
              recruitment of ``silent units'' with a 750-U dose, and no
              electrophysiologic effect with a 400-U dose. The tissues injected
              with phospholipase A2 and control solutions were examined
              histologically using a hematoxylin and eosin staining technique.
              In all three doses, the inflammatory changes were observed as
              soon as 2 hours after the injections. In control subjects, no
              changes were observed. CONCLUSIONS:After phospholipase A2
              injection, the discharge rate of the units showed dose and time
              dependent patterns. Regardless of the different doses, histologic
              changes were observed as soon as 2 hours after the phospholipase
              A2 injections.",

              around clinical practice needs. DESIGN:A within-subject,
              without-control, experimental, pre-test post-test study.
              SETTING:Clinical and educational facilities of Doncaster and
              Bassetlaw Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and locality-based
              outpatient facilities. Participants were 37 specialist
              musculoskeletal outpatient physiotherapists (band 6 and 7),
              working for Doncaster and Bassetlaw Hospitals NHS Foundation
              Trust. INTERVENTION:Participants completed three separate modules
              of in-service education through an academic year, based on
              learning outcomes identified from observation and performance
              rating of their clinical competencies. Each module lasted 7
              hours, with supporting clinical assistance sessions and
              self-directed learning time. The primary outcome measure was a
              (participant) performance rating (from novice to expert) of 20
              clinical competencies scored by experienced clinical educators
              before and after completion of the in-service education
              programme. A secondary, qualitative outcome measure (a
              purpose-made, semi-structured questionnaire) given after the
              programme explored participants' experiences and perceptions of
              the in-service education programme. RESULTS:Seven competencies
              were identified as the focus of the programme because their
              performance ratings were the lowest. All seven of these
              competencies improved following the programme. Communication
              scores improved by 6\%, clinical reasoning by 4\%, functional
              analysis of movement by 6\%, use of research in practice by 4\%,
              and critical appraisal of evidence by 4.6\%. Performance of
              structural differentiation and the range of manual handling
              skills demonstrated were the only competencies to show a
              statistically significant improvement of 14.6\% and 12\%,
              respectively (p$\leq$0.025(. Thematic analysis of the
              questionnaires revealed that 96\% of respondents felt that their
              practice had changed positively over the year because of the
              programme. CONCLUSIONS:Providing a structured and bespoke
              in-service education programme over an academic year may help to
              improve the rating of clinical competencies and give participants
              the perception that their clinical practice has changed because
              of the programme.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE:To describe the examination and intervention strategy
              utilized in the differential diagnosis and treatment of a patient
              with subcalcaneal heel pain. BACKGROUND:The patient was a
              44-year-old man with an 8-month history of left subcalcaneal heel
              pain. He presented with a chief complaint of limited standing and
              walking tolerance secondary to pain in the left heel. He had not
              responded to previous treatments of rest, anti-inflammatory
              medication, cortisone injections, and exercise prescription.
              MATERIALS AND METHODS:The patient's subcalcaneal heel pain was
              reproduced utilizing the straight leg raise (SLR) in combination
              with ankle dorsiflexion and eversion to sensitize the tibial
              nerve. These findings suggested a neurogenic component to the
              dysfunction. Because restricted ankle dorsiflexion, excessive
              pronation, and posterior tibialis weakness were also found,
              mechanical dysfunctions also likely contributed to the etiology
              of heel pain. The patient was treated for 10 visits over a period
              of 1 month. Treatment consisted of active and passive motions
              aimed at restoring pain-free soft-tissue motion along the course
              of the tibial nerve. In addition, low-dye taping and therapeutic
              exercises were utilized to control excessive pronation and reduce
              stress on the plantar structures of the foot. RESULTS:The
              patient's SLR increased from 42 degrees to 54 degrees and became
              pain-free. Dorsiflexion range of motion increased from 3 degrees
              to 8 degrees in the left ankle, and left posterior tibialis
              strength was normalized. Over a period of 1 month the patient's
              symptoms were resolved, and his standing and walking tolerance
              was fully restored. CONCLUSION:Assessment and potential
              contribution of neural dysfunction should be considered in
              patients with subcalcaneal heel pain.",

              guidance regarding whether older patients should receive early
              imaging for low back pain, in the absence of clinical
              indications. The study assesses the implications of early imaging
              by evaluating its association with downstream utilization in an
              elderly population. METHODS:Patients were included if they had a
              Medicare Advantage plan, had claims-based evidence of low back
              pain in 2014, and lacked conditions justifying early imaging. The
              outcomes examined were short-term, nonchronic, and chronic opioid
              use, steroid injections, and spinal surgery in the following 730
              days, and persistent low back pain at 180 to 365 days. Morphine
              dose equivalents of opioid use was used as a measure of
              intensity. Logistic and $\gamma$ regressions were used to assess
              the association between imaging in the first 6 weeks and the
              outcomes. RESULTS:Among the 57,293 patients meeting inclusion
              criteria, the mean age was 71.2, and 26,606 (46.4\%) received
              early imaging. Early imaging was associated with increased

              steroid injections (OR, 2.55; 95\% CI, 2.28 to 2.85) and spinal
              surgery (OR, 3.40; 95\% CI, 2.97 to 3.90). Patients that received

              1.09; 95\% CI, 1.05 to 1.14) and used significantly more morphine
              dose equivalents if they had nonchronic opioid use.

               low back pain. The importance of fear-avoidance beliefs for
               individuals with acute low back pain has not been explored.
               Seventy-eight subjects with work-related low back pain of less
               than 3 weeks'duration were studied. Measurements of pain
               intensity, physical impairment, disability, nonorganic signs and
               symptoms, and depression were taken at the initial evaluation.
               Fear-avoidance beliefs were measured with the work and physical
               activity subscales of the Fear-avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire.
               Disability and work status were re-assessed after 4 weeks of
               physical therapy. Patterns of correlation between fear-avoidance
               beliefs and other concurrently-measured variables were similar
               to those reported in patients with chronic low back pain.
               Fear-avoidance beliefs did not explain a significant amount of
               the variability in initial disability levels after controlling
               for pain intensity and physical impairment. Fear-avoidance
               beliefs about work were significant predictors of 4-week
               disability and work status even after controlling for initial
               levels of pain intensity, physical impairment, and disability,
               and the type of therapy received. Fear-avoidance beliefs are
               present in patients with acute low back pain, and may be an
               important factor in explaining the transition from acute to
               chronic conditions. Screening for fear-avoidance beliefs may be
               useful for identifying patients at risk of prolonged disability

  abstract = "STUDY DESIGN:Descriptive survey. OBJECTIVE:Describe the
              availability of thrust joint manipulation clinical educational
              opportunities for physical therapy professional degree students.
              BACKGROUND:In the United States, most of the faculty teaching
              manual therapy content in physical therapy programs believe that
              the best way for their students to develop thrust joint
              manipulation skills is to receive additional training during
              clinical education experiences. There are no data that describe
              the availability of such training opportunities. METHODS AND
              MEASURES:Seventy-three physical therapy programs that include
              thrust joint manipulation in their curricula were divided into 5
              geographic regions. Of these programs, 27\% (total, n = 20) were
              randomly selected per region to participate. Program academic
              coordinators of clinical education (ACCEs) identified their
              clinical instructors working in outpatient orthopaedic settings.
              ACCEs and clinical instructors were surveyed regarding thrust
              joint manipulation clinical education opportunities for students.
              RESULTS:Survey return rates were 100\% for ACCEs and 67.4\% for
              clinical instructors. Of ACCEs, 70\% were unsure which sites
              employed clinical instructors trained in thrust joint
              manipulation and 85\% did not consider whether thrust joint
              manipulation training was provided when scheduling the
              experience. The ACCEs who did consider availability cited lack of
              qualified instructors as the number-one barrier to finding sites
              that offered thrust joint manipulation. Of clinical instructors,
              30\% provide thrust joint manipulation training including
              lecture/theory, technique demonstration, practice on ``normals,''
              and direct patient care supervision. Clinical instructors who did
              not teach thrust joint manipulation cited reasons that included
              the belief that it is not an entry-level skill (57\%), lack of
              qualified staff (53\%), liability concerns (46\%), and students
              not being academically prepared (41\%). CONCLUSIONS:Results
              suggest that the availability and scope of thrust joint
              manipulation clinical educational opportunities are limited, vary
              considerably, and are not considered when selecting clinical
              education sites for students. Potential obstacles to offering
              thrust joint manipulation training were identified, which
              suggested the need for resources, including clinical education
              curricula and philosophical guidelines for clinical instructors.",

              degrees or 30 degrees achieves higher posterior and anterior IVS
              when using the SCTD. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:To our knowledge,
              research using a 0 degrees rope angle and the SCTD has not been
              documented. METHODS:A convenience sample of 15 females and 5
              males, with no history of cervical dysfunction, trauma, or pain,
              participated in the study. Static mechanical cervical traction,
              using the SCTD at a 0 degrees rope angle, was applied for 2
              minutes using 11.34 kg (25 lb) of force. A cross-table lateral
              cervical spine radiograph was obtained before traction and again
              at 2 minutes of traction. Two weeks later, the subjects underwent
              the same procedure with the rope angle set at 30 degrees .
              RESULTS:A 0 degrees rope angle produced a significant mean
              difference in anterior IVS at all cervical segments as compared
              to a 30 degrees rope angle. Traction measurements comparing
              posterior IVS at 0 degrees and 30 degrees were not statistically
              significant. However, the posterior IVS increased significantly
              at a 0 degrees rope angle, with the exception of C2-C3.
              CONCLUSIONS:The research findings may have treatment implications
              when applying cervical traction with the SCTD. Further research
              using subjects with cervical nerve root compression will need to
              be conducted to substantiate clinical outcomes.",

              evaluated administrative efficiency and psychometric adequacy of
              a computerized adaptive test (CAT) for patients with lumbar spine
              impairments seeking rehabilitation in outpatient therapy clinics.
              SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:CATs promise efficient outcomes data
              collection in clinical applications with little loss of
              measurement precision compared to paper and pencil surveys. The
              lumbar CAT has been developed and simulated and is currently used
              routinely in therapy clinics. The CAT has not been assessed for
              administrative efficiency, and the outcomes measures estimated
              using the CAT have not been assessed using prospective data
              collection for validity, sensitivity to change, or
              responsiveness. METHODS:Data from 17,439 patients with lumbar
              spine impairments receiving outpatient rehabilitation in 377
              clinics in 30 states (United States) were analyzed. We evaluated
              efficiency of routine CAT administration and assessed construct
              validity, sensitivity to change, and responsiveness of CAT
              measures of lumbar functional status (FS). RESULTS:On average,
              patients took less than 2 minutes (standard deviation <1 minute)
              to answer 7 CAT items (standard deviation, 3), which produced
              precise estimates of FS that adequately covered the content range
              with negligible floor and ceiling effects. Patients who were
              older had more chronic symptoms, had more surgeries, had more
              comorbidities, and did not exercise before receiving
              rehabilitation reported worse discharge FS. A total of 66\% of
              patients obtained statistically significant change (95\%
              confidence interval minimal detectable change) at discharge.
              Change of 5 FS units (scale, 0-100) represented minimal
              clinically important improvement, which 70\% of patients
              obtained. Minimal detectable change and minimal clinically
              important improvement were associated with intake FS.
              CONCLUSION:We concluded the lumbar CAT administration was
              efficient, and CAT FS measures were precise, valid, sensitive,
              and responsive, supporting lumbar CAT use in clinical and
              research applications.",

               men, 12 women; age range, 50-84y) with hip osteoarthritis.
               INTERVENTIONS:On 2 separate occasions, at least 1 week apart,
               isometric torque measurements were obtained from the hip
               rotators, flexors, abductors, and extensors. Passive ROMs in hip
               rotation, flexion, abduction, and extension were also
               determined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:Relative reliability was
               estimated using the intraclass correlation coefficient, model
               2,2 (ICC(2,2)). Absolute reliability was estimated using the
               coefficient of variation (CV) and the standard error (SE) of
               measurement. RESULTS:For measurements of muscle strength,
               ICC(2,2) ranged from .84 to .97, and the CV ranged from 8\% to
               15.7\%. Hip extensors and internal and external rotators showed
               high ICC(2,2) (>.96) and low CV (<9.8\%); hip abductors showed
               the lowest ICC(2,2) (.84) and the highest CV (15.7\%). For ROM
               measurements, ICC(2,2) ranged from .86 to .97 and SE ranged from
               3.1 degrees to 4.7 degrees . Hip flexion ROM showed the highest
               ICC(2,2) (.97) and an SE of 3.5 degrees ; hip extension ROM
               showed the lowest ICC(2,2) (.86) and the highest SE (4.7 degrees

              Background Deficits in ankle proprioceptive acuity have been
              reported in persons with functional instability of the ankle.
              Passive stiffness has been proposed as a possible mechanism
              underlying proprioceptive acuity. Objective To compare
              proprioceptive acuity and passive ankle stiffness in persons with
              and without functional ankle instability, and to assess the
              influence of passive joint stiffness on proprioceptive acuity in
              persons with functional ankle instability. Methods A sample of 18
              subjects with and 18 without complaints of functional ankle
              instability following lateral ankle sprain participated. An
              isokinetic dynamometer was used to compare motion perception
              threshold, passive position sense, and passive ankle stiffness
              between groups. To evaluate the influence of passive stiffness on
              proprioceptive acuity, individuals in the lateral functional
              ankle instability group were divided into 2 subgroups: ``high''
              and ``low'' passive ankle stiffness. Results The functional ankle
              instability group exhibited increased motion perception threshold
              when compared with the corresponding limb of the control group.
              Between-group differences were not found for passive position
              sense and passive ankle stiffness. Those in the functional ankle
              instability group with higher passive ankle stiffness had smaller
              motion perception thresholds than those with lower passive ankle
              stiffness. Conclusion Unlike motion perception threshold, passive
              position sense is not affected by the presence of functional
              ankle instability. Passive ankle stiffness appears to influence
              proprioceptive acuity in persons with functional ankle

               conditions for which patients seek physical therapy in the
               United States. The American Physical Therapy Association
               categorizes direct access to physical therapist services into 3
               levels: limited, provisional, and unrestricted. OBJECTIVE:The
               objective of this study was to evaluate the association of level
               of access to physical therapist services with LBP-related health
               care utilization and costs. DESIGN:This was a retrospective
               cohort study of patients with new-onset LBP between 2008 and
               2013; data were from OptumLabs Data Warehouse. METHODS:We
               identified 59,670 individuals who were 18 years old or older,
               who had new-onset LBP, and who had commercial or Medicare
               Advantage insurance through a private health plan. We examined 2
               samples. The first was health care utilization among individuals
               who saw a physical therapist first in states with either
               unrestricted access or provisional access. The second was
               LBP-related costs among individuals who saw either a physical
               therapist or a primary care physician first. RESULTS:Individuals
               who saw a physical therapist first in states with provisional
               access had significantly higher measures of health care
               utilization within 30 days, including plain imaging and
               frequency of physician visits, than individuals who saw a
               physical therapist first in states with unrestricted access.
               Compared with individuals who saw a primary care physician
               first, pooled across provisional-access and unrestricted-access
               states, those who saw a physical therapist first in
               provisional-access states had 25\% higher relative costs at 30
               days and 32\% higher relative costs at 90 days, whereas those
               who saw a physical therapist first in unrestricted-access states
               had 13\% lower costs at 30 days and 32\% lower costs at 90 days.
               LIMITATIONS:This was a claims-based study with limited

               reliability using 2 experienced clinicians performing 3
               palpation procedures over the lumbar facet joints and sacroiliac
               joints. METHODS:The sample consisted of 39 patients with low
               back pain who had a recent history of low back pain. Two doctors
               of chiropractic independently examined each of these patients in
               the prone position with 3 different procedures: (1) springing
               palpation for pain provocation, (2) springing palpation for
               segmental mobility testing, and (3) the prone instability test.
               The doctors were blinded to each other's findings and the
               patient's clinical status, and performed the examinations on the
               same day. Standard and adjusted kappa values were calculated for
               each test. RESULTS:The kappa values for palpation of segmental
               motion restriction were poor (range, -.20 to .17) and in many
               cases less than chance observation (negative kappa values). The
               prone instability test showed reasonable reliability (kappa =
               .54), and palpation for segmental pain provocation also showed
               fair to good reliability (kappa range, .21 to .73).
               CONCLUSIONS:Palpation methods that are used to provoke pain
               responses are more reliable than palpation methods in which the
               clinician purports to find segmental motion restriction. The
               prone instability test shows good reliability.",

  abstract  = "STUDY DESIGN:Literature review, expert panel, and a workshop
               during the ``VIII International Forum on Primary Care Research
               on Low Back Pain'' (Amsterdam, June 2006). OBJECTIVE:To develop
               practical guidance regarding the minimal important change (MIC)
               on frequently used measures of pain and functional status for
               low back pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:Empirical studies have
               tried to determine meaningful changes for back pain, using
               different methodologies. This has led to confusion about what
               change is clinically important for commonly used back pain
               outcome measures. METHODS:This study covered the Visual Analogue
               Scale (0-100) and the Numerical Rating Scale (0-10) for pain and
               for function, the Roland Disability Questionnaire (0-24), the
               Oswestry Disability Index (0-100), and the Quebec Back Pain
               Disability Questionnaire (0-100). The literature was reviewed
               for empirical evidence. Additionally, experts and participants
               of the VIII International Forum on Primary Care Research on Low
               Back Pain were consulted to develop international consensus on
               clinical interpretation. RESULTS:There was wide variation in
               study design and the methods used to estimate MICs, and in
               values found for MIC, where MIC is the improvement in clinical
               status of an individual patient. However, after discussion among
               experts and workshop participants a reasonable consensus was
               achieved. Proposed MIC values are: 15 for the Visual Analogue
               Scale, 2 for the Numerical Rating Scale, 5 for the Roland
               Disability Questionnaire, 10 for the Oswestry Disability Index,
               and 20 for the QBDQ. When the baseline score is taken into
               account, a 30\% improvement was considered a useful threshold
               for identifying clinically meaningful improvement on each of
               these measures. CONCLUSION:For a range of commonly used back
               pain outcome measures, a 30\% change from baseline may be
               considered clinically meaningful improvement when comparing
               before and after measures for individual patients. It is hoped
               that these proposals facilitate the use of these measures in
               clinical practice and the comparability of future studies. The
               proposed MIC values are not the final answer but offer a common
               starting point for future research.",

              is labelled a science even though physicians have the good sense
              not to practise it that way. Rather than thinking like scientists
              - or how we think scientists think - physicians are engaged in
              analogical, interpretive reasoning that resembles Aristotle's
              phronesis, or practical reasoning, more closely than episteme, or
              scientific reasoning. In medicine, phronesis is clinical
              judgment; and while it depends on both a fund of information and
              extensive experience, somehow it is not quite teachable. This
              practical, clinical rationality relies on case narrative for
              teaching and learning about illness and disease, for recording
              and communicating about patient care and, inevitably, for
              thinking about and remembering the details, as well as the
              overarching rules of practice. At the same time, ``anecdotal''
              remains the most pejorative word in medicine, and the tension
              between the justifiable caution this disdain expresses and the
              pervasive narrative structure of medical knowledge is
              characteristic of clinical knowing generally: a tug-of-war
              between apparent irreconcilables that can be settled only by an
              appeal to the circumstances of the clinical situation. Practical
              rationality in the clinical encounter is characterized by a
              productive circulation between the particular details of the
              patient's presentation and general information about disease
              stored as a taxonomy of cases. Evidence-based medicine can
              improve this negotiation between general knowledge and the
              patient's particulars, but it cannot replace it. In a scientific
              era, clinical judgment remains the quintessential intellectual
              strength of the clinician. Why, then, do we not teach the
              epistemology of medicine? Understanding the mis-description of
              physicians' thinking - and the accompanying claim that medicine
              is, in itself, a science - could mitigate the misplaced
              perfectionism that makes mistakes in medicine personal and

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND:There is an increasing recognition of the importance
               of using a conceptual framework covering the full range of
               relevant health domains and outcome measures addressed by
               physical therapy modalities in patients with chronic low back
               pain (CLBP). However, little is known about what outcome domains
               have been measured and through what measures in physical therapy
               research. OBJECTIVE:The purpose of this review was to synthesize
               outcome domains, instruments, and cutoff values reported in
               published randomized controlled trials and their compliance with
               the original Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information
               System (PROMIS) framework. DATA SOURCES:Embase, MEDLINE,
               Cochrane Library, and Physiotherapy Evidence Database electronic
               databases were systematically searched from January 2008 to
               April 2019. STUDY SELECTION:Randomized controlled trials that
               compared physical therapy with any other intervention for adults
               with CLBP were included. DATA EXTRACTION:Study characteristics,
               outcome domains, instruments, and cutoff values were extracted
               by 2 reviewers. The PROMIS framework was used for domain
               categorization. DATA SYNTHESIS:One hundred ninety-five studies
               were included, with 52 outcome domains and 45 cutoff values
               identified from 182 instruments reported. Only 14 of 195 studies
               assessed all PROMIS health core areas, whereas the PROMIS
               physical health core area was assessed in all included studies.
               Pain intensity and disability were the most frequently used
               domains. LIMITATIONS:Only studies for which full texts were
               available in English were included. CONCLUSIONS:This review
               identified a poor overlap between the PROMIS framework and
               outcome domains used to define the effectiveness of physical
               therapy in adults with CLBP. This finding suggests that other
               potential benefits resulting from physical therapy modalities
               are not being measured. Furthermore, a large diversity in the
               outcome domains and instruments was found.",

               Productivity Across Settings in an Academic Medical Center",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND:Clinical education is an integral component of
               physical therapy education. Both benefits and barriers exist in
               clinical education, but 1 commonly stated barrier includes the
               perception that students have a negative impact on clinical
               instructor productivity. OBJECTIVE:The purposes of this study
               were to evaluate the productivity of physical therapist clinical
               instructors in an academic medical center before, during, and
               after clinical education experiences, determine if there are
               differences in productivity during clinical education
               experiences across settings, and compare clinical instructor
               productivity with that of therapists who did not have a student
               during the same time frames. DESIGN:A retrospective design
               examined productivity across 3 years in acute care, inpatient
               rehabilitation, outpatient orthopedics, and outpatient
               neurology. Mean daily productivity was computed, normalized to
               an 8-hour day, and averaged for each week of the year. Data were
               analyzed using a repeated-measures ANOVA. Post-hoc comparisons
               were made within each setting to compare therapists with a
               student to those without. The Bonferonni-correction was used to
               control for multiple comparisons. RESULTS:Clinical instructor
               productivity was significantly increased in outpatient
               orthopedics and inpatient rehabilitation, and approached
               significance in outpatient neurology, but was not significant in
               acute care. The presence of a student made clinical instructors
               more productive but had no effect on the productivity of other
               therapists in that setting during the same time frame.
               LIMITATIONS:We studied only 1 academic medical center and could
               not account for clinical instructor factors such as years of
               experience or student factors such as year in their program.
               CONCLUSIONS:Our results indicate that having a student increases
               productivity of therapists in various settings. Future studies
               should examine the impact of clinical instructor experience and
               student characteristics and should expand to other settings.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE:It is often observed that different rehabilitation
              practitioners carrying out the same intervention can have a quite
              different impact on outcome. The relationship or connection
              between the practitioner and patient, referred to here as the
              therapeutic alliance (TA), is receiving growing attention as
              potentially contributing to the disparate response to treatment
              observed. In this paper, we discuss what we currently know about
              the TA in rehabilitation and its impact on engagement (and what
              do we not know) and consider the ramifications of not knowing.
              KEY MESSAGES:The TA is increasingly identified as an important
              determinant of engagement in, and health outcome following,
              rehabilitation. However, research identifying its core components
              is limited, with very little exploring howpractitioners might
              develop a more positive TA with patients. Further, what we do
              know/understand is limited by inadequate measurement tools.
              Research aiming to better understand the key ingredients of the
              TA that contribute to outcome and its role in rehabilitation is
              urgently required. CONCLUSIONS:Arguably, if we fail to advance
              knowledge in this field and seek answers to some of the questions
              we have raised, we may fail to tap into the true potential of the
              TA as a covariate of rehabilitation outcome.",

              diagnosis. The findings of the physical examination usually
              corroborate the thoughts generated by the medical history.
              However, it is not uncommon for the physician to note
              discrepancies between the history and the physical examination.
              METHODS:Two physicians provided a list of diseases they have
              encountered in which there is occasionally discordance between
              the data retrieved from the patient's medical history and the
              findings of the physical examination. To verify the data from
              knowledge and experience, we resorted to two main medical
              textbooks and relevant articles from PubMed. RESULTS:We
              identified 25 diseases where a discordance between history and
              physical examination may frequently be observed. These diseases
              cover a wide spectrum of systems (i.e., neurological,
              cardiological, respiratory, and gastrointestinal). DISCUSSION:A
              variety of diseases are associated with a discordance between the
              findings one might expect based on the medical history and the
              actual findings of the physical examination. Physicians need to
              be aware of this paradox, as misdiagnosis can be detrimental in
              some of these diseases. We acknowledge that this is just a
              sample, and not an exhaustive list, of all diseases with such a

               and all controlled trials of the efficacy of spinal manipulation
               were analyzed. Fifty-eight articles, including 25 controlled
               trials, were retrieved. DATA ANALYSIS: Data on the use and
               complications of spinal manipulation were summarized. Controlled
               trials of efficacy were critically appraised for study quality.
               Data from nine studies were combined using the confidence
               profile method of meta-analysis to estimate the effect of spinal
               manipulation on patients' pain and functional outcomes. RESULTS
               OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Chiropractors provide most of the
               manipulative therapy used in the United States for patients with
               low-back pain. Serious complications of lumbar manipulation,
               including paraplegia and death, have been reported. Although the
               occurrence rate of these complications is unknown, it is
               probably low. For patients with uncomplicated, acute low-back
               pain, the difference in probability of recovery at 3 weeks
               favoring treatment with spinal manipulation is 0.17 (for
               example, increase in recovery from 50\% to 67\%; 95\%
               probability limits of estimate, 0.07 to 0.28). For patients with
               low-back pain and sciatic nerve irritation, the difference in
               probabilities of recovery at 4 weeks is 0.098 (probability
               limits, -0.016 to 0.209). CONCLUSIONS: Spinal manipulation is of
               short-term benefit in some patients, particularly those with
               uncomplicated, acute low-back pain. Data are insufficient
               concerning the efficacy of spinal manipulation for chronic
               low-back pain.",

  abstract = "STUDY DESIGN:Retrospective investigation of muscle changes in
              patients suffering from chronic whiplash-associated disorders
              (WAD). OBJECTIVES:To quantitatively compare the presence of
              muscle alterations (fatty infiltrate [MFI] and cross-sectional
              area [CSA]) in the anterior musculature of the cervical spine in
              a cohort of chronic whiplash patients (WAD II) and healthy
              control subjects across muscle and cervical segmental level.
              SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:Magnetic resonance imaging can be
              regarded as the gold standard for muscle imaging. There is little
              knowledge about in vivo features of anterior neck muscles in
              patients suffering from chronic WAD and how muscle structure
              differs across the factors of muscle, vertebral level, age,
              self-reported pain and disability, body mass index, and duration
              of symptoms. METHODS:Reliable magnetic resonance imaging measures
              for MFI and CSA were performed for the anterior cervical muscles
              bilaterally in 109 female subjects (78 WAD, 31 healthy control;
              18-45 years, 3 months to 3 years postinjury). The measures were
              performed on all subjects for the longus capitis and colli and
              the sternocleidomastoid muscles. RESULTS:The WAD subjects had
              significantly larger MFI and CSA for the anterior muscles
              compared to healthy control subjects (all P < 0.0001). In
              addition, the amount of MFI varied by both cervical level and
              muscle, with the longus capitis/colli having the largest amount
              of fatty infiltrates at the C2-C3 level (P < 0.0001). MFI was
              inversely related to age, self-reported pain/disability, and body
              mass index but directly proportional to duration of symptoms.
              CONCLUSION:There is significantly greater MFI and CSA in the
              anterior neck muscles, especially in the deeper longus
              capitis/colli muscles, in subjects with chronic WAD when compared
              to healthy controls. Future studies are required to investigate
              the relationships between muscular morphometry and symptoms in
              patients suffering from acute and chronic WAD.",

              perseverance and passion for long-term goals, grit accounted for
              an average of 4\% of the variance in success outcomes, including
              educational attainment among 2 samples of adults (N=1,545 and
              N=690), grade point average among Ivy League undergraduates

              Grit nonetheless demonstrated incremental predictive validity of
              success measures over and beyond IQ and conscientiousness.

              between the use of open-ended questions and the amount of
              information obtained from patients during the medical interview.
              This study examines this relationship using a relatively large
              sample size under more standardized conditions than in previous
              studies. The Japanese Group for Research on the Medical Interview
              undertook this research in 2002-2003. A total of 1,527 medical
              students conducted medical interviews with standardized patients,
              and 1,220 met the inclusion criteria for this study. The
              interview was limited to five minutes. Evaluators (medical school
              faculty physicians) evaluated the use of open-ended questions
              during the medical interview. The reliability of the evaluation
              sheet was also examined. The amount of information obtained was
              measured through the medical interview evaluation sheet. The use
              of open-ended questions was positively related to the amount of
              information elicited from the patients (F = 41.0, p < 0.0001).
              This study provides data to support the hypothesis regarding the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that SLAP (superior
              labrum anterior posterior) lesions are a distinct clinical
              entity. The goals of this study were to define the prevalence,
              associated pathological findings, and clinical features of the
              different types of SLAP lesions with use of a common
              classification system. METHODS: Five hundred and forty-four
              patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy for a variety of
              diagnoses were prospectively included in this consecutive case
              series. SLAP lesions were grouped with use of the Snyder
              classification. Demographic data, clinical data, and arthroscopic
              findings in the groups with SLAP lesions were compared with those
              in a control group with no SLAP lesion. RESULTS: Of 544 shoulder
              arthroscopy procedures, 139 (26\%) demonstrated a SLAP lesion.
              One hundred and three (74\%) of the SLAP lesions were Type I,
              twenty-nine (21\%) were Type II, one (0.7\%) was Type III, and
              six (4\%) were Type IV. Most (123) of the SLAP lesions were found
              to be associated with other intra-articular lesions. Multivariate
              analysis revealed that a positive Speed test and a supraspinatus
              tear were significantly associated with Type-I lesions (p = 0.012
              and p = 0.001, respectively). The findings associated with
              Type-II lesions differed according to the patient's age: Type-II
              lesions in patients who were forty years of age or younger were
              associated only with a Bankart lesion, whereas those in patients
              older than forty years of age were associated with a
              supraspinatus tear and osteoarthritis of the humeral head.
              Type-III and Type-IV lesions were associated with a high-demand
              occupation and a Bankart lesion. CONCLUSIONS: This study
              demonstrated that the prevalence, associated pathological
              findings, and clinical features of the different types of SLAP
              lesions vary with the patient population that is studied. Also,
              the clinical features and pathological findings associated with
              the different types of SLAP lesions often overlap. Isolated SLAP
              lesions with no associated pathological findings are uncommon,
              and care must be taken when ascribing symptoms to a SLAP lesion
              when other lesions are present. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic

               only and PA plus cognitive-behavioral therapy for pain (CBT-P)
               among older adult veterans with CLBP. Design:This study was a
               pilot randomized trial comparing a 12-week telephone-supported
               PA-only intervention group (PA group) or PA plus CBT-P
               intervention group (PA + CBT-P group) and a wait-list control
               group (WL group). Setting:The study setting was the Durham
               Veterans Affairs Health Care System. Participants:The study
               participants were 60 older adults with CLBP. Interventions:The
               PA intervention included stretching, strengthening, and aerobic
               activities; CBT-P covered activity pacing, relaxation
               techniques, and cognitive restructuring.
               Measurements:Feasibility measures included enrollment and
               completion metrics; acceptability was measured by completed
               phone calls. Primary outcomes included the Timed ``Up \& Go''
               Test and the PROMIS Health Assessment Questionnaire. Generalized
               linear mixed models were used to estimate changes within and
               between groups. Effect sizes were calculated with the Cohen d.
               Adverse effects were measured by self-report. Results:The mean
               participant age was 70.3 years; 53\% were not white, and 93\%
               were men. Eighty-three percent of participants completed the
               study, and the mean number of completed phone calls was 10 (of
               13). Compared with the results for the WL group, small to medium
               treatment effects were found for the intervention groups in the
               Timed ``Up \& Go'' Test (PA group: -2.94 [95\% CI = -6.24 to
               0.35], effect size = -0.28; PA + CBT-P group: -3.26 [95\% CI =
               -6.69 to 0.18], effect size = -0.31) and the PROMIS Health
               Assessment Questionnaire (PA group: -6.11 [95\% CI = -12.85 to
               0.64], effect size = -0.64; PA + CBT-P group: -4.10 [95\% CI =
               -11.69 to 3.48], effect size = -0.43). Small treatment effects
               favored PA over PA + CBT-P. No adverse effects were noted.
               Limitations:This was a pilot study, and a larger study is needed
               to verify the results. Conclusions:This pilot trial demonstrated
               that home-based telephone-supported PA interventions were
               feasible, acceptable, and safe for older adult veterans. The

               outcome measures that comprise a standardized activity) are
               useful for assessing functioning in patients with low back pain.
               PURPOSE:The purpose of this study was to systematically review
               the level of evidence for the reliability, validity, and
               responsiveness of physical capacity tasks. DATA SOURCES:MEDLINE,
               CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and relevant
               reference lists were used as data sources. STUDY SELECTION:Two
               authors independently selected articles addressing the
               reliability, validity, and responsiveness of physical capacity
               tasks, and a third author resolved discrepancies. DATA
               EXTRACTION AND QUALITY ASSESSMENT:One author performed data
               extraction, and a second author independently checked the data
               extraction for accuracy. Two authors independently assessed the
               methodological quality with the Consensus-Based Standards for
               the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) 4-point
               checklist, and a third author resolved discrepancies. DATA
               SYNTHESIS AND ANALYSIS:Data synthesis was performed by all
               authors to determine the level of evidence per measurement
               property per physical capacity task. The 5-repetition
               sit-to-stand, 5-minute walk, 50-ft (∼15.3-m) walk, Progressive
               Isoinertial Lifting Evaluation, and Timed ``Up \& Go'' tasks
               displayed moderate to strong evidence for positive ratings of
               both reliability and construct validity. The 1-minute
               stair-climbing, 5-repetition sit-to-stand, shuttle walking, and
               Timed ``Up \& Go'' tasks showed limited evidence for positive
               ratings of responsiveness. LIMITATIONS:The COSMIN 4-point
               checklist was originally developed for patient-reported outcome
               measures and not physical capacity tasks. CONCLUSIONS:The
               5-repetition sit-to-stand, 50-ft walk, 5-minute walk,
               Progressive Isoinertial Lifting Evaluation, Timed ``Up \& Go,''
               and 1-minute stair-climbing tasks are promising tests for the
               measurement of functioning in patients with chronic low back
               pain. However, more research on the measurement error and
               responsiveness of these tasks is needed to be able to fully
               recommend them as outcome measures in research and clinical
               practice.",

               One hundred and three clinical experts (31 Pain consultants, 72

               were asked to suggest clinical indicators of three separate

               re-rate their level of agreement/disagreement (Round 3) with
               those clinical indicators. Consensus was defined by a >or=80\%
               level of agreement. Sixty-two (Response rate, 60\%), 60 (58\%)

  abstract = "Employers can choose from lots of tools when they want to
              encourage employees to work together toward a new corporate goal.
              One of the rarest managerial skills is the ability to understand
              which tools will work in a given situation and which will
              misfire. Cooperation tools fall into four major categories:
              power, management, leadership, and culture. Choosing the right
              tool, say the authors, requires assessing the organization along
              two critical dimensions: the extent to which people agree on what
              they want and the extent to which they agree on cause and effect,
              or how to get what they want. The authors plot on a matrix where
              various organizations fall along these two dimensions. Employees
              represented in the lower-left quadrant of the model, for example,
              disagree strongly both about what they want and on what actions
              will produce which results. Those in the upper-right quadrant
              agree on both dimensions. Different quadrants call for different
              tools. When employees share little consensus on either dimension,
              for instance, the only methods that will elicit cooperation are
              ``power tools'' such as fiat, force, and threats. Yugoslavia's
              Josip Broz Tito wielded such devices effectively. So did Jamie
              Dimon, current CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, during the bank's
              integration with Bank One. For employees who agree on what they
              want but not on how to get it--think of Microsoft in
              1995--leadership tools, such as vision statements, are more
              appropriate. Some leaders are blessed with an instinct for
              choosing the right tools--Continental Airlines' Gordon Bethune,
              General Electric's Jack Welch, and IBM's Lou Gerstner are all
              examples. Others can use this framework to help select the most
              appropriate tools for their circumstances.",

               manipulation technique based on the presence or absence of an
               audible pop despite the lack of evidence suggesting that this
               pop is associated with improved outcomes. The purpose of this
               study was to determine the relationship between the number of
               audible pops with thoracic spinal manipulation and improvement
               in pain and function in patients with mechanical neck pain. In
               this prospective cohort study, 78 patients referred to physical
               therapy with mechanical neck pain underwent a standardized
               examination and thoracic spine manipulation treatment protocol.
               All patients were treated with a total of 6 thrust manipulation
               techniques directed to the thoracic spine followed by a basic
               cervical range of motion exercise. The treating clinician
               recorded the presence or absence of a pop during each
               manipulation. Outcomes were assessed at a 2-4 day follow-up with
               an 11-point numeric pain rating (NPRS), the Neck Disability
               Index, the patient Global Rating of Change (GROC), and
               measurements of cervical range of motion (CROM). The
               relationship between the number of pops and change scores for
               pain, disability, and CROM was first examined using Pearson
               correlation coefficients. Individuals were then categorized as
               having received 3 pops. Repeated measures analyses of variance
               were used to examine whether achievement of >3 pops resulted in
               improved outcome. Seventy-eight patients with a mean age of 42
               (SD 11.3) years participated in the study. Pearson correlation
               coefficients revealed no significant correlation existed between
               the number of pops and outcomes with the exception of 3 of the 6
               CROM measurements, which were inversely related. There was no
               significant interaction for group X time for any of the
               dependent measures (P>0.05). The odds ratio for patients
               experiencing dramatic improvement was in favor of the group
               experiencing </=3 pops but this was not clinically meaningful
               (1.3: 95\% CI 0.46, 3.7). The results of this analysis provide
               preliminary evidence for the hypothesis that there is no
               relationship between the number of audible pops during thoracic
               spine thrust manipulation and clinically meaningful improvements
               in pain, disability, or CROM in patients with mechanical neck
               pain. Additionally, a greater number of audible pops experienced
               was not associated with a dramatic improvement with manipulation
               treatment.",

              short-term effects of upper cervical and upper thoracic
              high-velocity low-amplitude (HVLA) thrust manipulation to
              nonthrust mobilization in patients with neck pain.
              BACKGROUND:Although upper cervical and upper thoracic HVLA thrust
              manipulation and nonthrust mobilization are common interventions
              for the management of neck pain, no studies have directly
              compared the effects of both upper cervical and upper thoracic
              HVLA thrust manipulation to nonthrust mobilization in patients
              with neck pain. METHODS:Patients completed the Neck Disability
              Index, the numeric pain rating scale, the flexion-rotation test
              for measurement of C1-2 passive rotation range of motion, and the
              craniocervical flexion test for measurement of deep cervical
              flexor motor performance. Following the baseline evaluation,
              patients were randomized to receive either HVLA thrust
              manipulation or nonthrust mobilization to the upper cervical
              (C1-2) and upper thoracic (T1-2) spines. Patients were reexamined
              48-hours after the initial examination and again completed the
              outcome measures. The effects of treatment on disability, pain,
              C1-2 passive rotation range of motion, and motor performance of
              the deep cervical flexors were examined with a 2-by-2 mixed-model
              analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS:One hundred seven patients
              satisfied the eligibility criteria, agreed to participate, and
              were randomized into the HVLA thrust manipulation (n = 56) and
              nonthrust mobilization (n = 51) groups. The 2-by-2 ANOVA
              demonstrated that patients with mechanical neck pain who received
              the combination of upper cervical and upper thoracic HVLA thrust
              manipulation experienced significantly (P<.001) greater
              reductions in disability (50.5\%) and pain (58.5\%) than those of
              the nonthrust mobilization group (12.8\% and 12.6\%,
              respectively) following treatment. In addition, the HVLA thrust
              manipulation group had significantly (P<.001) greater improvement
              in both passive C1-2 rotation range of motion and motor
              performance of the deep cervical flexor muscles as compared to
              the group that received nonthrust mobilization. The number needed
              to treat to avoid an unsuccessful outcome was 1.8 and 2.3 at
              48-hour follow-up, using the global rating of change and Neck
              Disability Index cut scores, respectively. CONCLUSION:The
              combination of upper cervical and upper thoracic HVLA thrust
              manipulation is appreciably more effective in the short term than
              nonthrust mobilization in patients with mechanical neck pain.

              pressure on the median nerve as it travels through the carpal
