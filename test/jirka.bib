              increase in the concentration of H+ in ocean surface waters since

              benthic ecosystems at shallow coastal sites where volcanic CO2

              pH (8.1--8.2) to lowered pH (mean 7.8--7.9, minimum 7.4--7.5),
              typical rocky shore communities with abundant calcareous

              validation of predictions that these important groups of
              organisms are susceptible to elevated amounts of p CO2. Sea-grass
              production was highest in an area at mean pH 7.6 (1,827 muatm p

              suite of organisms that are resilient to naturally high
              concentrations of p CO2 and indicate that ocean acidification may
              benefit highly invasive non-native algal species. Our results
              provide the first in situ insights into how shallow water marine

               focuses upon the various processes by which organisms direct the

               the current state of knowledge regarding the major approaches to
               mineralization that organisms have developed over the course of
               Earth history. By exploring the complexities that underlie the

               how compositions and structures of biominerals are mediated (or

              climate change. Since the 1960s about 90\% of the excess heat
              added to the Earth's climate system has been stored in the
              oceans1, 2. The ocean's dominant role over the atmosphere, land,
              or cryosphere comes from its high heat capacity and ability to
              remove heat from the sea surface by currents and mixing. The
              longest interval over which instrumental records of subsurface
              global-scale temperature can be compared is the 135 years between
              the voyage of HMS Challenger3 (1872--1876) and the modern data
              set of the Argo Programme4 (2004--2010). Argo's unprecedented
              global coverage permits its comparison with any earlier
              measurements. This, the first global-scale comparison of
              Challenger and modern data, shows spatial mean warming at the
              surface of 0.59 °C$\pm$0.12, consistent with previous estimates5
              of globally averaged sea surface temperature increase. Below the
              surface the mean warming decreases to 0.39 °C$\pm$0.18 at 366 m
              (200 fathoms) and 0.12 °C$\pm$0.07 at 914 m (500 fathoms). The
              0.33 °C$\pm$0.14 average temperature difference from 0 to 700 m
              is twice the value observed globally in that depth range over the
              past 50 years6, implying a centennial timescale for the present

              of the Challenger expedition and the modern Argo Programme and

  abstract = "Global-scale deteriorations in coral reef health have caused
              major shifts in species composition. One projected consequence is
              a lowering of reef carbonate production rates, potentially
              impairing reef growth, compromising ecosystem functionality and
              ultimately leading to net reef erosion. Here, using measures of
              gross and net carbonate production and erosion from 19 Caribbean
              reefs, we show that contemporary carbonate production rates are
              now substantially below historical (mid- to late-Holocene)
              values. On average, current production rates are reduced by at
              least 50\%, and 37\% of surveyed sites were net erosional.
              Calculated accretion rates (mm year(-1)) for shallow fore-reef
              habitats are also close to an order of magnitude lower than
              Holocene averages. A live coral cover threshold of ~10\% appears
              critical to maintaining positive production states. Below this
              ecological threshold carbonate budgets typically become net
              negative and threaten reef accretion. Collectively, these data
              suggest that recent ecological declines are now suppressing
              Caribbean reef growth potential.",

              phylogenetic identification of individual cells by NanoSIMS
              imaging. To overcome the natural fluorine and bromine
              backgrounds, we modified the current catalyzed reporter
              deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique by
              using halogen-containing fluorescently labeled tyramides as
              substrates for the enzymatic tyramide deposition. Thereby, we

              demography of the Caribbean sea fan coral, Gorgonia ventalina .
              The innate coral immune defenses can be measured as constitutive
              levels of immune proteins (peroxidase [POX], prophenoloxidase
              [PPO], lysozyme-like activity [LYS], exochitinase [EXOC]),
              antioxidant (superoxide dismutase [SOD]), and antimicrobial
              (antibacterial [AB] and antifungal [AF]) activity. Therefore,
              variations in these parameters across a geographic region could
              provide clues to the role of environment in disease. This study
              examined healthy sea fans collected in July 2005 from six
              offshore sites in the Florida Keys lying between 24.569°N and
              25.220°N, a distance of ~145 km. Contrary to expectations, small
              (15 cm) in the protein-based levels of activity in any of the
              measured parameters. However, there were significant differences
              in many of the parameters among sites, and Molasses Reef and Looe
              Key Reef were the most different in POX, PPO, SOD, and AF
              activity. This suggests that there are potential site-specific
              environmental factors that shape the immune physiology of
              colonies. Several proxies of environmental stress were also
              regressed against levels of the immune parameters. The proxies
              included 10 year averages of benthic community composition, 5
              year averages of water quality, and historic aspergillosis
              disease prevalence and severity. Generality about environmental
              drivers was limited by assaying only six sites, but several
              patterns did emerge. SOD, EXOC, and AF activity were all
              correlated with percent bare substrate cover, suggesting that
              certain immune components may be activated in low coral
              environments. LYS and EXOC activity were positively correlated
              with dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), one proxy of water
              quality. There were no relationships between any of the measured
              immune parameters and previous disease prevalence and severity.
              This study is a first step in evaluating levels of within- and
              between-site variation in coral immunity and investigating
              possible environmental drivers.",

              continued global warming, bleaching events are predicted to

              we show that the coral host has a significant role in recovery

              algae in hospite. This assumption was tested with 15 species of
              scleractinian corals, using pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM)
              chlorophyll a (chl a) fluorescence to compare maximum quantum
              yields (Fv/Fm) of photosystem II (PSII) in Symbiodinium in
              hospite and after isolation in seawater. FIS from Montipora spp.
              exhibited rapid and dramatic decreases (by up to >95\%) in PSII
              activity within 30 min of isolation. In contrast, PSII activities
              of FIS from 8 other coral species decreased by only 5 to 21\%
              after >4 h in seawater. To investigate possible reasons for this
              variation, the variation in Symbiodinium genetic type (ITS-2
              types), transmission modes and several physiological indices were
              considered. The rapid loss of PSII activity in FIS from Montipora
              spp. was not correlated with Symbiodinium ITS-2 type, the mode of
              symbiont transmission, or ionic regulation capability, nor could
              consistent chemical effects in host extracts be demonstrated.
              PSII inactivation was correlated with increased levels of

              skeletonized phyla first appearing in the fossil record at this
              time. The appearance of disparate molluscan forms during this
              period leaves open the possibility that shells evolved
              independently and in parallel in at least some groups. To test
              this proposition and gain insight into the evolution of
              structural genes that contribute to shell fabrication, we
              compared genes expressed in nacre (mother-of-pearl) forming cells
              in the mantle of the bivalve Pinctada maxima and the gastropod
              Haliotis asinina. Despite both species having highly lustrous
              nacre, we find extensive differences in these expressed gene
              sets. Following the removal of housekeeping genes, less than 10\%
              of all gene clusters are shared between these molluscs, with some
              being conserved biomineralization genes that are also found in
              deuterostomes. These differences extend to secreted proteins that
              may localize to the organic shell matrix, with less than 15\% of
              this secretome being shared. Despite these differences, H.
              asinina and P. maxima both secrete proteins with repetitive
              low-complexity domains (RLCDs). Pinctada maxima RLCD proteins-for
              example, the shematrins-are predominated by silk/fibroin-like
              domains, which are absent from the H. asinina data set.
              Comparisons of shematrin genes across three species of Pinctada
              indicate that this gene family has undergone extensive divergent
              evolution within pearl oysters. We also detect fundamental
              bivalve-gastropod differences in extracellular matrix proteins
              involved in mollusc-shell formation. Pinctada maxima expresses a
              chitin synthase at high levels and several chitin deacetylation
              genes, whereas only one protein involved in chitin interactions
              is present in the H. asinina data set, suggesting that the
              organic matrix on which calcification proceeds differs
              fundamentally between these species. Large-scale differences in
              genes expressed in nacre-forming cells of Pinctada and Haliotis
              are compatible with the hypothesis that gastropod and bivalve
              nacre is the result of convergent evolution. The expression of
              novel biomineralizing RLCD proteins in each of these two molluscs
              and, interestingly, sea urchins suggests that the evolution of
              such structural proteins has occurred independently multiple
              times in the Metazoa.",

              reefs is strongly biased by two factors: geological history and
              research intensity. These biases are sufficiently strong to cast
              doubts on the biological meaning of the recorded raw pattern.
              Without adjustment it is hard or impossible to identify factors
              potentially controlling the waxing and waning of this important
              ecosystem through time. Although it is impossible to completely
              compensate for the biases, I demonstrate herein that
              spatiotemporal heterogeneities of the biases can largely be
              evened out by: (1) omitting oceanic reef sites and reef sites
              only known from subsurface exploration; (2) standardizing for
              economic factors known to affect research intensity; and (3)
              adjusting for sedimentary cycling processes. The resulting curves
              of fossil reef abundance and volume appear quite different from
              the original ones but neither is the overall volatility reduced,
              nor are patterns of waxing and waning of the time series
              significantly altered. Thus, although the differences are
              sufficiently strong to call for new tests of potential extrinsic
              controls on Phanerozoic reef proliferation, the raw curves
              correctly reflect the basic timing of major reef blooms and
              declines.",

              carcinoma cells were exposed to CO(2)-insufflation in 5 different
              pressure groups: 6 mmHg, 9 mmHg, 12 mmHg, 15 mmHg and control
              group, respectively for 1 h. Expression of E-cadherin, ICAM-1,

              CO(2)-insufflation using flow cytometry. The adhesion and
              invasion capacity of SW1116 cells before and after exposure to
              CO(2)-insufflation was detected by cell adhesion/invasion assay

              nodules, visceral metastases and survival of the mice were
              recorded in each group. RESULTS: The expression of E-cadherin,
              ICAM-1, CD44 and E-selectin in SW1116 cells were changed
              significantly following exposure to CO(2) insufflation at
              different pressures (P < 0.05). The expression of E-cadherin,
              CD44 and ICAM-1 decreased with increasing CO(2)-insufflation
              pressure. The adhesive/invasive cells also decreased gradually
              with increasing pressure as determined by the adhesion/invasion
              assay. In animal experiments, the number of abdominal cavity
              tumor nodules in the 15 mmHg group was also significantly lower
              than that in the 6 mmHg group (29.7 $\pm$ 9.91 vs 41.7 $\pm$
              14.90, P = 0.046). However, the survival in each group was not

              temporary change in the adhesion and invasion capacity of cancer
              cells in vitro. Higher CO(2)-insufflation pressure inhibited
              adhesion, invasion and metastatic potential in vitro and in vivo,

              and Grunwald, Dev Biol 135:158-171, 1989; Lagunowich et al., J
              Neurosci Res 32:202-208, 1992), and that this down-regulation is
              due to multiple factors, including decreased mRNA levels and
              turnover apparently mediated by endogenous metalloproteolytic
              activity (Roark et al., Development 114:973-984, 1992). In the
              present study, we describe metabolic studies which provide direct
              biochemical evidence for turnover of 130-kDa N-cadherin in
              embryonic retina tissues, yielding a soluble 90-kDa N-terminal
              fragment. We demonstrate that this form of N-cadherin, which we
              refer to as NCAD90, accumulates in vivo during development. We
              further demonstrate that purified NCAD90, obtained from embryonic
              vitreous humor, retains biological function and promotes cell
              adhesion and neurite growth in a dose-dependent fashion among
              chick embryo neural retina cells when present in a
              substrate-bound form. The morphology of retinal cells and
              neurites grown on a substrate of NCAD90 differs strikingly from
              that seen on a laminin substrate, in a manner similar to that
              described for intact 130-kDa N-cadherin. We conclude that
              proteolysis of N-cadherin at the cell surface during embryonic
              retinal histogenesis is an endogenous mechanism for regulating
              N-cadherin expression which generates a novel and functional form
              of the protein. The results further indicate that an intact
              cytoplasmic domain is not essential for all cadherin functions.",

              the magnesium and strontium incorporation into benthic
              foraminiferal calcite under laboratory conditions. For this
              purpose individuals of the shallow-water species Heterostegina
              depressa (precipitating high-Mg calcite, symbiont-bearing) and
              Ammonia tepida (low-Mg calcite, symbiont-barren) were cultured in
              media under a range of [Ca2+], but similar Mg/Ca ratios. Trace
              element/Ca ratios of newly formed calcite were analysed with
              Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry
              (LA-ICP-MS) and normalized to the seawater elemental composition
              using the equation DTE=(TE/Cacalcite)/(TE/Caseawater). The
              culturing study shows that DMg of A. tepida significantly
              decreases with increasing $\Omega$ at a gradient of
              −4.3$\times$10−5 per $\Omega$ unit. The DSr value of A. tepida
              does not change with $\Omega$, suggesting that fossil Sr/Ca in
              this species may be a potential tool to reconstruct past
              variations in seawater Sr/Ca. Conversely, DMg of H. depressa
              shows only a minor decrease with increasing $\Omega$, while DSr
              increases considerably with $\Omega$ at a gradient of 0.009 per
              $\Omega$ unit. The different responses to seawater chemistry of
              the two species may be explained by a difference in the
              calcification pathway that is, at the same time, responsible for
              the variation in the total Mg incorporation between the two
              species. Since the Mg/Ca ratio in H. depressa is 50--100 times
              higher than that of A. tepida, it is suggested that the latter
              exhibits a mechanism that decreases the Mg/Ca ratio of the
              calcification fluid, while the high-Mg calcite forming species
              may not have this physiological tool. If the dependency of Mg
              incorporation on seawater [Ca2+] is also valid for deep-sea
              benthic foraminifera typically used for paleostudies, the higher
              Ca concentrations in the past may potentially bias temperature
              reconstructions to a considerable degree. For instance, 25 Myr
              ago Mg/Ca ratios in A. tepida would have been 0.2 mmol/mol lower
              than today, due to the 1.5 times higher [Ca2+] of seawater, which
              in turn would lead to a temperature underestimation of more than
              2 °C.",

              depend to calcify their skeletons1, 2. Using boron isotope
              systematics3, we show how scleractinian corals up-regulate pH at
              their site of calcification such that internal changes are
              approximately one-half of those in ambient seawater. This
              species-dependent pH-buffering capacity enables aragonitic corals
              to raise the saturation state of their calcifying medium, thereby
              increasing calcification rates at little additional energy cost.
              Using a model of pH regulation combined with abiotic
              calcification, we show that the enhanced kinetics of
              calcification owing to higher temperatures has the potential to
              counter the effects of ocean acidification. Up-regulation of pH,
              however, is not ubiquitous among calcifying organisms; those
              lacking this ability are likely to undergo severe declines in
              calcification as CO2 levels increase. The capacity to up-regulate
              pH is thus central to the resilience of calcifiers to ocean
              acidification, although the fate of zooxanthellate corals
              ultimately depends on the ability of both the photosymbionts and

              carbonate in the form of aragonite. The mineral deposition occurs

              discussion to what extent the calcification occurs under
              biological or environmental control. Hence, the shape, size and
              organization of skeletal crystals from the cellular level through
              the colony architecture, were attributed to factors as diverse as
              mineral supersaturation levels and organic mediation of crystal
              growth. The skeleton contains an intra-skeletal organic matrix (
              OM) of which only the water soluble component was chemically and
              physically characterized. In this work that OM from the skeleton
              of the Balanophyllia europaea, a solitary scleractinian coral
              endemic to the Mediterranean Sea, is studied in vitro with the
              aim of understanding its role in the mineralization of calcium

              effect is enhanced by their co-presence. The role of magnesium
              ions is also affected by the presence of the OM components. Thus,
              in vitro, OM influences calcium carbonate crystal morphology,
              aggregation and polymorphism as a function of its composition and
              of the content of magnesium ions in the precipitation media. This
              research, although does not resolve the controversy between
              environmental or biological control on the deposition of calcium
              carbonate in corals, sheds a light on the role of OM, which
              appears mediated by the presence of magnesium ions.",

              linear extension of skeletons remains unchanged. Inspection of
              the microstructure of skeletons and measurements of pH at the
              site of calcification indicate that dissolution is not
              responsible for changes in skeletal porosity. Instead, changes
              occur by enlargement of corallite-calyxes and thinning of
              associated skeletal elements, constituting a modification in
              skeleton architecture. We also detect increases in the organic
              matrix protein content of skeletons formed under lower pH.
              Overall, our study reveals that seawater acidification not only
              causes decreases in calcification, but can also cause
              morphological change of the coral skeleton to a more porous and
              potentially fragile phenotype.",

              calcification, threatening coral reef growth. Predicting how
              corals respond to CO2 requires a better understanding of how
              calcification is controlled. Here we show how spatial variations
              in the pH of the internal calcifying fluid (pHcf) in coral
              (Stylophora pistillata) colonies correlates with differential
              sensitivity of calcification to acidification. Coral apexes had
              the highest pHcf and experienced the smallest changes in pHcf in
              response to acidification. Lateral growth was associated with
              lower pHcf and greater changes with acidification. Calcification
              showed a pattern similar to pHcf, with lateral growth being more
              strongly affected by acidification than apical. Regulation of
              pHcf is therefore spatially variable within a coral and critical
              to determining the sensitivity of calcification to ocean
              acidification.",

  abstract = "Biominerals contain both inorganic and organic components.
              Organic components are collectively termed the organic matrix,
              and this matrix has been reported to play a crucial role in
              mineralization. Several matrix proteins have been characterized
              in vertebrates, but only a few in invertebrates, primarily in
              Molluscs and Echinoderms. Methods classically used to extract
              organic matrix proteins eliminate potential low molecular weight
              matrix components, since cut-offs ranging from 3.5 to 10 kDa are
              used to desalt matrix extracts. Consequently, the presence of
              such components remains unknown and these are never subjected to
              further analyses. In the present study, we have used
              microcolonies from the Scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata
              to study newly synthesized matrix components by labelling them
              with C-14-labelled amino acids. Radioactive matrix components
              were investigated by a method in which both total organic matrix
              and fractions of matrix below and above 5 kDa were analyzed.
              Using this method and SDS-PAGE analyses, we were able to detect
              the presence of low molecular mass matrix components (< 3.5 kDa),
              but no free amino acids in the skeletal organic matrix. Since
              more than 98\% of the C-14-labelled amino acids were incorporated
              into low molecular weight molecules, these probably form the bulk
              of newly synthesized organic matrix components. Our results
              suggest that these low molecular weight components may be
              peptides, which can be involved in the regulation of coral
              skeleton mineralization. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights

              Montastrea annularis (Ellis and Solander) and Siderastrea siderea
              (Ellis and Solander) during July and August 1991. P. porites and

              characterised by different water quality affecting light
              transmission, and at depths of down to 30 m on a barrier reef on
              the west coast of the island. m. annularis contained, on average,
              29\% of dry weight as lipid, and there were no significant
              differences in lipid levels between corals sampled on either

              taken from a single massive colony of S. siderea at 3 m on a
              fringing reef and at 13, 20 and 30 m depth on the barrier reef.
              Values for lipid ranged from 26 to 35\% of dry tissue weight. P.
              porites from 3 and 6 m depth on both fringing reefs contained the
              same amount of lipid (~11\% of dry tissue weight). However, at 13

              total lipid, wax ester and triglyceride content, and fatty acid
              composition. M. annularis contained about 32\% of dry weight as
              total lipid, whereas much lower values of between 11 and 17\%
              were recorded for the other four species. It is concluded that
              there is greater variation in coral total lipid than hitherto
              thought. The total lipid contained a substantial proportion of
              wax ester (22 to 49\%) and triglyceride (18 to 37\%). The storage
              lipids (wax esters and triglycerides) accounted for between 6 and
              20\% of the dry weight and between 46 and 73\% of the total
              lipid. Variation in lipid content between species could not be
              attributed to geographical location, but the low values for total
              lipid in Red Sea corals may in part be due to environmental
              factors as these samples were collected in winter. All corals
              analysed contained high levels of saturated fatty acids, the most
              abundant fatty acids being 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1n-9. Marked
              differences were observed in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)
              content between species, with comparatively low levels of 10 and
              11\% of fatty acids being recorded in M. annularis and G.
              retiformis, respectively. The values for the other species ranged
              between 21 and 37\%. Fatty acid composition may vary according to
              the proportions of fatty acids obtained from diet, algal
              photosynthesis and synthesis by the animal tissues.",

              of scleractinian corals and hence the recovery of degraded coral
              reefs. It is therefore important to explore how the warmer and
              more acidic oceanic conditions predicted for the future could
              affect these processes. This study used controlled culture to
              investigate the effects of a 1†$\infty$C increase in temperature
              and a 0.2-0.25†unit decrease in pH on the settlement and survival
              of planulae and the growth of primary polyps in the Tropical
              Eastern Pacific coral Porites panamensis. We found that primary
              polyp growth was reduced only marginally by more acidic seawater
              but the combined effect of high temperature and lowered pH caused
              a significant reduction in growth of primary polyps by almost a
              third. Elevated temperature was found to significantly reduce the
              amount of zooxanthellae in primary polyps, and when combined with
              lowered pH resulted in a significant reduction in biomass of
              primary polyps. However, survival and settlement of planula
              larvae were unaffected by increased temperature, lowered acidity
              or the combination of both. These results indicate that in future
              scenarios of increased temperature and oceanic acidity coral
              planulae will be able to disperse and settle successfully but
              primary polyp growth may be hampered. The recovery of reefs may
              therefore be impeded by global change even if local stressors are

              accretion of coral reefs yet little is known about its effect on
              coral photophysiology. This study investigated the effect of
              increasing CO2 on photosynthetic capacity and photoprotection in
              Acropora formosa. The photoprotective role of photorespiration
              within dinoflagellates (genus Symbiodinium) has largely been
              overlooked due to focus on the presence of a carbon-concentrating
              mechanism despite the evolutionary persistence of a Form II
              Rubisco. The photorespiratory fixation of oxygen produces
              phosphoglycolate that would otherwise inhibit carbon fixation
              though the Calvin cycle if it were not converted to glycolate by
              phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PGPase). Glycolate is then either
              excreted or dealt with by enzymes in the photorespiratory
              glycolate and/or glycerate pathways adding to the pool of carbon
              fixed in photosynthesis. We found that CO2 enrichment led to
              enhanced photoacclimation (increased chlorophyll a per cell) to
              the subsaturating light levels. Light-enhanced dark respiration
              per cell and xanthophyll de-epoxidation increased, with resultant
              decreases in photosynthetic capacity (Pnmax) per chlorophyll. The
              conservative CO2 emission scenario (A1B; 600--790 ppm) led to a
              38\% increase in the Pnmax per cell whereas the
              `business-as-usual' scenario (A1F1; 1160--1500 ppm) led to a 45\%
              reduction in PGPase expression and no change in Pnmax per cell.
              These findings support an important functional role for PGPase in
              dinoflagellates that is potentially compromised under CO2
              enrichment.",

              electron microscopic level had shown that the initial phase of
              calcification occurred in close association with organic
              substances secreted by calicoblastic cells. The possibility was
              thereby proposed that certain organic substances induce formation
              of calcium carbonate crystals, presumably functioning as
              templates for nucleation. In search for such a molecule,
              biochemical and molecular analyses were initiated on protein
              components of the organic matrix extracted from the calcified
              exoskeleton of the hermatypic coral, Galaxea fascicularis and the
              ahermatype, Tubastrea aurea. In SDS-PAGE analyses of the
              extracts, one major protein and a few other minor bands were
              detected in each of the two species. A cDNA encoding the major
              protein (named galaxin) in G. fascicularis was cloned and its
              primary structure was deduced. It consisted mostly of tandem
              repeats of a unit sequence of about 30 residues, and its sequence
              did not exhibit significant similarity to known proteins.
              Preliminary characterization of the T. aurea proteins showed that
              two proteins bound Ca2+, and suggested that the major protein of
              46 kDa was not homologous to galaxin.",

              double-loop (`loop-in-a-loop') stabilized by two highly conserved
              disulfide bridges located at the bases of the loops, as well as a
              set of conserved hydrophobic and polar interactions. The second
              loop, called the long loop region, is structurally and
              evolutionarily flexible, and is involved in Ca2+-dependent
              carbohydrate binding and interaction with other ligands. This
              loop is completely absent in a subset of CTLDs, which we refer to
              as compact CTLDs; these include the Link/PTR domain and bacterial
              CTLDs. CTLD-containing proteins (CTLDcps) were originally
              classified into seven groups based on their overall domain

              completely sequenced genomes have added 10 new groups to the
              classification, and shown that it is applicable only to
              vertebrate CTLDcps; despite the abundance of CTLDcps in the
              invertebrate genomes studied, the domain architectures of these
              proteins do not match those of the vertebrate groups.
              Ca2+-dependent carbohydrate binding is the most common CTLD

              (CAs) were examined in intact cells by measuring 18 O exchange
              from doubly labelled CO 2 ( 13 C 18 O 18 O) to water and by using

              algae were found to be significantly different in their modes of

              actively transport both HCO inf3 sup- and CO 2 from the external
              medium, while Coccomyxa clearly favoured CO 2 as a substrate.
              Both algae were found to possess external as well as internal
              CAs, but the relative amounts of these as well as their overall
              significance for the functioning of photosynthesis differed. In
              Coccomyxa , the internal CA activity was significantly higher
              than in Chlamydomonas and also predominated over the external
              activity. In Chlamydomonas , both transport and fixation of DIC
              were severely inhibited by ethoxyzolamide, an inhibitor of
              external and internal CAs as well as the DIC-transporting system,
              while this inhibitor only caused a minor inhibition of
              photosynthesis in Coccomyxa . These results thus give strong
              support for earlier indirect observations of the absence of a CO
              2 concentrating mechanism in Coccomyxa . In addition, Coccomyxa
              was found to possess a Rubisco with a higher carboxylation
              efficiency than Chlamydomonas , having a K m (CO 2 ) of 12 +3 µM
              CO 2 and a CO 2 /O 2 specificity factor ( S c/o ) of 83 +2, and
              it may hence be concluded that the absence of the CO 2

              efficient Rubisco in this alga.",

              corymbosa and Leptastraea purpurea) by combining mapping of
              skeletal ultrastructural patterns by SEM and in situ analysis by
              Raman microspectroscopy. The two elementary ultrastructural
              features typical of scleractinian corals, the centers of
              calcification and the sets of aragonite fibers, have been
              characterized in the uppermost parts (i.e. the ``living zone'')
              of both coral colonies. Diagenetic features affecting the
              skeleton itself and also represented by fibrous diagenetic
              cements have been analyzed in the oldest basal parts of each
              colony. All Raman spectra display several vibrational bands
              typical of aragonite (but no calcite). Additionally, several
              Raman bands indicate the presence of organic compounds, some of
              which likely characterize proteinous components, and provide the
              first in situ chemical record of the skeletal organic matrices.
              Tentative assignments to CH, CH2, CH3, NH2, CHO, CNC, and SO
              groups are proposed. In the ``living zone,'' some of these bands
              are different in the two coral species. In Raman spectra measured
              in the oldest skeletal parts of both colonies, these bands
              decrease markedly in number and diversity or even disappear,
              indicating that significant decay of intraskeletal organic
              matrices does occur in just a few years. Therefore, early
              diagenesis in these skeletons results from the interaction
              between the degradation of organic matrices and the diagenetic
              processes affecting the skeletal aragonite submicron-size
              crystals.",

              (west) of Barbados to study the effects of eutrophication
              processes upon the scleractinian coral assemblages. The structure
              of scleractinian coral communities was studied along an
              eutrophication gradient with a quantitative sampling method (line
              transect) in terms of species composition, zonation and diversity
              patterns. On the basis of these data the fringing reefs were
              divided into three ecological zones: back reef, reef flat, and
              spur and groove. Statistically discernible and biologically
              significant differences in scleractinian coral community
              structure, benthic algal cover and Diadema antillarum Philippi
              densities were recorded among the seven fringing reefs. High
              correlations between environmental variables and biotic patterns
              indicate that the effects of eutrophication processes (nutrient
              enrichment, sedimentation, turbidity, toxicity and bacterial
              activity) were directly and/or indirectly affecting the community
              structure of scleractinian coral assemblages. In general, species
              diversity was most sensitive in delineating among-reef, and
              among-zone, differences, which were attributed to intensification
              of eutrophication processes. Porites astreoides Lamarck, P.
              porites (Pallas), Siderastrea radians (Pallas), and Agaricia

              Meandrina meandrites (Linnaeus)] indicate that eutrophication
              processes may adversely affect these species. It is suggested
              that sediment rejection abilities, combined with feeding and
              reproductive strategies, are the primary biological processes of
              scleractinian corals through which eutrophication processes

              monitor water at both the surface and benthos. Our reference
              station, 500 m from the CO2 vent, had no noticeable vent
              influence. It had a naturally high and stable benthic pH (mean
              8.16, inter-quartile range (IQ): 8.14--8.18) fluctuating with
              diel periodicity, presumably driven by community photosynthesis
              and respiration. A principal component analysis (PCA) revealed
              that the pH of this station was well constrained by
              meteorological parameters. In contrast, a station positioned
              within the vent zone, had a low and very variable benthic mean pH
              of 7.11 (IQ: 6.91--7.62) with large pH fluctuations not well
              constrained by a PCA. Any stations positioned within 20 m of the

              pH fluctuations making them unsuitable representatives to predict
              future changes to a shallow coastal environment. Between these
              extremes, we identified a benthic area with a lower pH of 7.84

              variability. Our results indicate that a range of pH environments
              maybe commonplace near CO2 vents due to their characteristic
              acidification of benthic water over a wide area. Such
              environments could become invaluable natural laboratories for

              many sites exist in which two of the same amino acids and one of

              same two or three glutamic and/or aspartic amino acids are found

              aspartic and glutamic acid, respectively. Fourth, several sites

              are present in close proximity to the same two or three amino
              acids of opposite charge (glutamic acid and lysine or arginine
              residues or aspartic acid and lysine or arginine residues).
              Fifth, there are several sites where hydroxylysine contributes
              charged groups in place of one of the three lysine or arginine
              residues common in adjacent collagen helices. The strikingly
              repetitive and close nature of these specific charged groups in

              receptors and subsequently activate intracellular signaling
              pathways. Our data indeed show that the presence of extracellular
              DMP1 triggers focal adhesion point formation in human mesenchymal
              stem cells and osteoblast-like cells. We determine that DMP1 acts
              via interaction with $\alpha$v$\beta$3 integrin and stimulates
              phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase. Further biochemical
              characterization confirms the activation of downstream effectors
              of the MAPK pathways, namely ERK and JNK, after DMP1 treatment.
              This activation is specifically inhibitable and can also be
              blocked by the addition of anti-$\alpha$v$\beta$3 integrin
              antibody. Furthermore, we show that extracellular treatment with
              DMP1 stimulates the translocation of phosphorylated JNK to the

              activation by phosphorylated c-Jun. The evidence presented here

              Amelogenin, the major extracellular matrix protein of dental

              cooperative interactions with forming mineral phase. Using

              Corals therefore appear to allow increases in symbiont density
              when symbiosis is advantageous during the warm season, followed
              by a net reduction during the cold season when zooxanthellae may

              free of contamination by other oocyte proteins. It was determined
              that each zona pellucida contains 4.8 ng of protein, which
              represents 80\% or more of the dry weight of the zona pellucida
              and about 17\% of the oocyte's total protein. Electrophoretic
              analyses of as few as five isolated zonae pellucidae treated with
              diazotized [125I]iodosulfanilic acid revealed the presence of
              only three radiolabeled proteins, designated ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3.
              The same three proteins were identified by Coomassie blue
              staining when large numbers of isolated zonae pellucidae
              (approximately 750) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel
              electrophoresis. These three proteins migrate as broad bands on
              SDS-polyacrylamide gels, consistent with their being
              glycoproteins, with apparent molecular weights of 200,000 (ZP1),
              120,000 (ZP2), and 83,000 (ZP3). The same proteins were
              radiolabeled when intact oocytes were treated with diazotized
              [125I]iodosulfanilic acid, a reagent which does not penetrate the
              oocyte's plasma membrane, or when isolated zonae pellucidae were
              treated with 3H-labeled 1-dimethylaminonaphthalene-5-sulfonyl
              chloride. Results of amino acid analysis and high-resolution
              two-dimensional electrophoresis of the individual proteins
              suggest that each protein represents a unique polypeptide chain.
              The proteins ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3 represent about 36, 47, and 17\%,
              respectively, of the total protein of the zona pellucida. In the

              apparent molecular weight of 130,000, suggesting that it exists
              as an oligomer, stabilized by disulfide bonds, in the unreduced
              state. The results of these experiments are discussed in terms of
              the properties of the zona pellucida before and after

              contain 33 introns that interrupt the coding region (exons) at

              differ, and many introns contain repetitive DNA elements. The
              introns in these two genes that have apparently arisen by
              duplication have diverged extensively by events that include
              deletions, insertions, and probably duplications. Rapid
              evolutionary change involving rearrangements and the presence of
              repeated DNA suggests that the bulk of the sequences within
              introns may not have any specific function.",

              function of bone forming cells during osteogenesis. Here, the
              evidence that N-cadherin is an important regulator of osteoblast
              differentiation and osteogenesis is reviewed. Osteoblasts express
              a limited number of cadherins, including the classic N-cadherin.
              The expression profile of N-cadherin in osteoblasts during bone
              formation in vivo and in vitro suggests a role of this molecule
              in osteogenesis. Functional studies using neutralizing antibodies
              or antisense oligonucleotides indicate that N-cadherin is
              involved in the control the expression of osteoblast marker gene
              expression and differentiation. Cleavage of N-cadherin during
              osteoblast apoptosis also suggests a role of
              N-cadherin-mediated-cell--cell adhesion in osteoblast survival.
              Hormonal and local factors that regulate osteoblast function also
              regulate N-cadherin expression and subsequent cell--cell adhesion
              associated with osteoblast differentiation or survival. Signaling
              mechanisms involved in N-cadherin-mediated cell--cell adhesion
              and osteoblast gene expression have also been identified.
              Alterations of N-cadherin expression are associated with abnormal
              osteoblast differentiation and osteogenesis in pathological
              conditions. These findings indicate that N-cadherin plays a role

              adhesion on contact with the materials is of crucial importance.
              The proteins involved in osteoblast adhesion are described in
              this review (extracellular matrix proteins, cytoskeletal
              proteins, integrins, cadherins, etc.). During osteoblast/material
              interactions, their expression is modified according to the

  abstract = "Many organisms produce complex, hierarchically structured,
              inorganic materials via protein-influenced crystal growth---a
              process known as biomineralization. Understanding this process
              would shed light on hard-tissue formation and guide efforts to
              develop biomaterials. We created and tested a computational
              method to design protein-biomineralization systems. The algorithm
              folds a protein from a fully extended structure and
              simultaneously optimizes the fold, orientation, and sequence of
              the protein adsorbed to a crystal surface. We used the algorithm
              to design peptides (16 residues) to modify calcite (CaCO3)
              crystallization. We chemically synthesized six peptides that were
              predicted to bind different states of a calcite growth plane. All
              six peptides dramatically affected calcite crystal growth (as
              observed by scanning electron microscopy), and the effects were
              dependent on the targeted state of the \{001\} growth plane.
              Additionally, we synthesized and assayed scrambled variants of
              all six designed peptides to distinguish cases where sequence
              composition determines the interactions versus cases where
              sequence order (and presumably structure) plays a role. Scrambled
              variants of negatively charged peptides also had dramatic effects
              on calcite crystallization; in contrast, scrambled variants of
              positively charged peptides had a variable effect on
              crystallization, ranging from dramatic to mild. Special emphasis
              is often placed on acidic protein residues in calcified tissue

              role for basic residues as well. In particular, this work

              Bay, Hawaii, the effect of various potential organic substrates
              on growth in vitro was assessed in Erdschreiber seawater medium
              (ES) supplemented with organic compounds. Zooxanthellae
              maintained at 5 to 7 µE m -2 s -1 (below compensation irradiance)
              grew heterotrophically when supplied with 100 µ M glycerol,
              glycolate, acetate, malate, or propionate, and grew in darkness
              on 100 µ M propionate. Zooxanthellae exposed to irradiance below
              compensation were able to utilize carbon sources in the
              unsupplemented ES medium for slow growth, but generally the
              growth rate of cultured zooxanthellae was a function of
              incubation irradiance. Zooxanthellae incubated for 10 wk in
              unsupplemented ES at 5 to 7 µE m -2 s -1 were capable of growth
              at this low irradiance, but were also capable of net
              photosynthetic oxygen production at higher irradiances. This
              suggests that zooxanthellae can be photoautotrophic or

              mitosis ( t d ) is made on the basis of growth rate of cultured

              intensify in response to continued anthropogenic disturbance from
              coastal development, pollution, and climate change. In response
              to these stresses, reef-building corals may exhibit bleaching,
              which marks the breakdown in symbiosis between coral and
              zooxanthellae. Mass coral bleaching due to elevated water
              temperature can devastate coral reefs on a large geographical
              scale. In order to understand the molecular and cellular basis of
              bleaching in corals, we have measured gene expression changes
              associated with thermal stress and bleaching using a
              complementary DNA microarray containing 1310 genes of the
              Caribbean coral Montastraea faveolata. In a first experiment, we

              cytoskeletal organization, cell death, calcification, metabolism,

              adhesion changes, decreased calcification, and the initiation of

              the effects of elevated CO2 on coral calcification without the

              millepora, using as reference a novel comprehensive transcriptome
              assembly developed for this study. Gene ontology analysis of this

              formation and growth. Thus, characterization of acidic proteins
              in the insoluble organic matrix is an important first step toward
              linking function to individual proteins in alcyonarian coral.
              Analysis of proteinaceous components in the soluble and insoluble
              matrix fractions of Sinularia polydactyla indicates that aspartic
              acid composes about 61\% of the insoluble and 29\% of the soluble
              matrix fractions. Using an in vitro assay, we show that matrix
              proteins induced formation of amorphous CaCO3 precipitates prior
              to their transformation into the calcitic crystalline form. The
              crystalline form of CaCO3 in the sclerites was also identified by
              X-ray diffraction, revealing calcitic polymorphisms with a strong
              (104) reflection. The structure of alcyonarian organic matrices
              containing aspartate-rich proteins and polysaccharides was
              assessed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR).
              Calcium-binding analysis of components in the insoluble matrix
              fraction indicated that a protein of 109 kD can bind Ca2+, which
              is important for sclerite formation. An assay for carbonic
              anhydrase (CA) enzyme, which is believed to play an important
              role in the process of biocalcification revealed novel activity.
              These results strongly suggest that the aspartic acid-rich

              document extremely high caspase-specific activity and expression
              of immunoreactive proteins to human caspase 8 antisera, both of
              which were induced by salt stress and death and were abolished by
              in vivo addition of a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor. Caspase
              inhibition severely impaired cell growth under low and high salt
              stress, demonstrating a critical role in the cellular stress
              response. In silico analysis of the H. volcanii proteome
              identified a subset of 18 potential target proteins containing a
              signature tetrapeptide caspase cleavage motif (IETD), some with
              putative roles in allosteric regulation, signal transduction,

              manipulative studies, high-throughput transcriptomic data
              combined with bioinformatics methods provide a powerful approach
              to obtain initial insights into the function of unknown genes. In
              this study, we report the identification and characterization of
              a novel family of putatively secreted, small, cysteine-rich
              proteins herein named Small Cysteine-Rich Proteins (SCRiPs).
              Their discovery in expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries from
              the coral Montastraea faveolata required the performance of an
              iterative search strategy based on BLAST and Hidden-Markov-Model
              algorithms. While a discernible homolog could neither be
              identified in the genome of the sea anemone Nematostella
              vectensis, nor in a large EST dataset from the symbiotic sea
              anemone Aiptasia pallida, we identified SCRiP sequences in
              multiple scleractinian coral species. Therefore, we postulate
              that this gene family is an example of lineage-specific gene
              expansion in reef-building corals. Previously published gene
              expression microarray data suggest that a sub-group of SCRiPs is
              highly responsive to thermal stress. Furthermore, data from
              microarray experiments investigating developmental gene
              expression in the coral Acropora millepora suggest that different
              SCRiPs may play distinct roles in the development of corals. The
              function of these proteins remains to be elucidated, but our
              results from in silico, transcriptomic, and phylogenetic analyses
              provide initial insights into the evolution of SCRiPs, a novel,

              The identification of proteins with a cystine knot structure is
              difficult by commonly used pairwise alignments because the
              sequence homology among these proteins is low. Taking advantage
              of complete genome sequences in diverse organisms, we used a
              complementary approach of pattern searches and pairwise
              alignments to screen the predicted protein sequences of five
              model species (human, fly, worm, slime mold, and yeast) and
              retrieved proteins with low sequence homology but containing a
              typical cystine knot signature. Sequence comparison between
              proteins known to have a cystine knot three-dimensional structure
              (transforming growth factor-$\beta$, glycoprotein hormone, and
              platelet-derived growth factor subfamily members) identified new

  abstract = "BACKGROUND:Motivated by the precarious state of the world's coral
              reefs, there is currently a keen interest in coral
              transcriptomics. By identifying changes in coral gene expression
              that are triggered by particular environmental stressors, we can
              begin to characterize coral stress responses at the molecular
              level, which should lead to the development of more powerful
              diagnostic tools for evaluating the health of corals in the
              field. Furthermore, the identification of genetic variants that
              are more or less resilient in the face of particular stressors
              will help us to develop more reliable prognoses for particular
              coral populations. Toward this end, we performed deep mRNA
              sequencing of the cauliflower coral, Pocillopora damicornis, a
              geographically widespread Indo-Pacific species that exhibits a
              great diversity of colony forms and is able to thrive in habitats
              subject to a wide range of human impacts. Importantly, P.
              damicornis is particularly amenable to laboratory culture. We
              collected specimens from three geographically isolated Hawaiian
              populations subjected to qualitatively different levels of human
              impact. We isolated RNA from colony fragments (``nubbins'')
              exposed to four environmental stressors (heat, desiccation,
              peroxide, and hypo-saline conditions) or control conditions. The
              RNA was pooled and sequenced using the 454 platform. Description.
              Both the raw reads (n = 1,116,551) and the assembled contigs (n =
              70,786; mean length = 836 nucleotides) were deposited in a new
              publicly available relational database called PocilloporaBase
              (www.PocilloporaBase.org). Using BLASTX, 47.2\% of the contigs
              were found to match a sequence in the NCBI database at an E-value
              threshold of [less than or equal to].001; 93.6\% of those contigs
              with matches in the NCBI database appear to be of metazoan origin
              and 2.3\% bacterial origin, while most of the remaining 4.1\%
              match to other eukaryotes, including algae and
              amoebae.CONCLUSIONS:P. damicornis now joins the handful of coral
              species for which extensive transcriptomic data are publicly
              available. Through PocilloporaBase (www.PocilloporaBase.org), one
              can obtain assembled contigs and raw reads and query the data

  author   = "Weber, Jon N",
  abstract = "Two thousand and twenty well-characterized coral specimens from
              17 localities have been analyzed for Sr. Seventy-three genera and
              subgenera, mostly hermatypic scleractinians, are represented. For
              some genera, specimens living in surface reef environments are
              compared with those from 18.3 m depths on the same reefs. Growth
              rates for some species have also been measured at these depths at
              one of the sampling sites. Skeletal strontium for a given genus
              decreases with increasing water temperature, a relationship which
              previously eluded detection. Aragonite deposited by corals living
              on the reef at a depth of 18.3 m contains more strontium than the
              skeletal aragonite of the same coral genera from shallow-water,
              surface environments. Quantitative treatment of the data for
              Acropora, one of the most abundant and widely distributed of the
              reef-building corals, suggests that the observed strontium
              variations may reflect variations in the rate of skeletal
              calcification, rather than direct dependence upon temperature or
              water depth. There is evidence for `species effects', apparently
              unrelated to growth rate differences, in that certain coral
              genera are consistently enriched or depleted in skeletal
              strontium content relative to other genera living in the same
              reef environments under identical ambient conditions.
              Temperature, salinity, water depth, seawater composition, and/or
              other such parameters may in part determine the levels of trace
              element concentration in carbonates deposited by corals and other
              marine invertebrates, but it would appear that these variables
              more directly affect physiological processes which in turn

              coral Acropora sp. for the purpose of evaluating temperature
              proxies for paleoceanographic applications. In the first
              experiment, corals were cultivated under three light levels (100,
              200, 400 $\mu$mol photons m−2 s−1) and constant temperature (27
              °C). In the second experiment, corals were cultivated at five
              temperatures (21, 23, 25, 27, 29 °C) and constant light (400
              $\mu$mol photons m−2 s−1). Increasing the water temperature from
              21 to 29 °C, induced a 5.7-fold increase in the rate of
              calcification, which induced a 30\% increase in the Mg/Ca ratio.
              In contrast, by increasing the light level by a factor of 4, the
              rate of calcification was increased only by a factor of 1.7, with
              a corresponding 9\% increase in the Mg/Ca ratio. Thus, the
              relative change in the calcification rate in the two experiments
              (5.7 vs. 1.7) scales with the corresponding relative change in
              Mg/Ca ratio (30\% vs. 9\%). We conclude that there is a strong
              biological control on the incorporation of Mg. For Sr/Ca, good
              correlations were also observed with water temperature and the
              calcification rate induced by temperature changes. However, in
              sharp contrast with the Mg/Ca ratio, a temperature-induced
              5.7-fold increase in the calcification rate only induced a 4.5\%
              change (decrease) in the Sr/Ca ratio. An important finding for
              paleoceanographic applications is that the Sr/Ca ratio did not
              appear to be sensitive to changes in the light level, or to
              changes in calcification rate induced by changes in the light
              level. Thus, in this study, water temperature was found to be the
              dominant parameter controlling the skeletal Sr/Ca ratio.",

              It is unclear how the main body axis of Cnidaria, the sister
              group to the Bilateria, is related to the two body axes of
              Bilateria. The conserved antagonism between two secreted factors,
              BMP2/4 (Dpp in Drosophila) and its antagonist Chordin (Short

              could therefore provide important insight into the evolutionary
              origin of bilaterian axes. Here, we cloned and characterized two

              along both the oral--aboral body axis and along an axis
              perpendicular to this one, the directive axis. Unexpectedly,
              NvDpp and NvChordin show complex and overlapping expression on
              the same side of the embryo, whereas NvGDF5-like and NvGremlin
              are both expressed on the opposite side. Yet, the two pairs of
              ligands and antagonists only partially overlap, suggesting
              complex gradients of BMP activity along the directive axis but
              also along the oral--aboral axis. We conclude that a molecular
              interaction between BMP-like molecules and their secreted
              antagonists was already employed in the common ancestor of
              Cnidaria and Bilateria to create axial asymmetries, but that
              there is no simple relationship between the oral--aboral body
              axis of Nematostella and one particular body axis of Bilateria.",

              coccolithophores, calcite precipitation. Even in cultures where
              pCO2 or pH is maintained constant, other chemical parameters
              change substantially at high cell densities. Experimentally we

              represent the basis of the marine food web. This diverse group of
              organisms drives important biogeochemical cycles, exporting
              massive amounts of carbon to deep waters and sediments, and
              strongly influencing ocean--atmosphere gas exchanges.
              Anthropogenic climate change will result in significant
              alterations in the marine environment over the next 100 yr and
              beyond. The increase in atmospheric CO2 has already caused
              significantly higher aquatic CO2 concentrations and lower pH
              values (`ocean acidification') than in pre-industrial times.
              Rising temperatures will also impact surface ocean
              stratification, which in turn will affect the surface-water light
              regime and nutrient input from deeper layers. Phytoplankton will
              be affected by these environmental changes in many ways. In this
              article we assess the possible responses of different

              simulate future ocean acidification, and allude to common

              the use of buffers. In addition to guidelines for CO2
              perturbation experiments, we argue that it is essential to look
              at multiple environmental factors in combination with CO2, to aim
              for process-understanding rather than correlation, and to assess
              a wider diversity of phytoplankton species both in laboratory and

  title    = "The Ecological Evolution of Reefs",
  author   = "Wood, Rachel",
  abstract = "Many groups of extinct and extant organisms have aggregated to
              form reefs for over 3.5 billion yr (Ga). Most of these
              communities, however, grew under ecological and environmental
              controls profoundly different from those that govern modern coral
              reefs. Not only has the global distribution of reefs varied
              considerably through geological time--determined largely by sea
              level, and latitudinal temperature/saturation gradients--but more
              importantly the trophic demands of reef-building organisms have
              changed, as has the degree of biological disturbance faced by
              sessile biota in shallow marine environments. Reefs
              differentiated into open surface and cryptic communities as soon
              as open frameworks developed in the Proterozoic, some 1.9 million
              yr ago (mya) and diverse and complex ecosystems were established
              by the early Cambrian (∼ 520 mya). Calcified heterotrophs were
              conspicuous in reefs during the Paleozoic and early Mesozoic, but
              considerable rigidity was imparted to these often otherwise
              fragile communities both by indirect microbial processes that
              induced the formation of carbonate and by rapid early
              cementation. While photosymbiosis was probably acquired by
              scleractinian corals early in their history (∼ 210 mya), this
              does not appear to have immediately conferred a superior
              reef-building ability. Large, modular corals and coralline algae
              showed notable powers of regeneration after partial mortality but
              poor ability to compete with macroalgae for limited substrate in
              the absence of intense herbivory; they did not rise to prominence
              in reef communities until the early to mid-Cenozoic. This may be
              related to the appearance at this time of major predator groups
              such as echinoids, limpets, and particularly fish that are
              capable of rapid algal denudation and excavation. The existence
              of this reciprocal relationship is corroborated by the
              observation that branching corals, which appear to flourish
              because and not in spite of breakage, show a particularly
              dramatic increase in diversity coincident with the increase in
              predation pressure from the late Mesozoic onwards.",

              extracellular proteins secreted by the calcifying epithelial
              cells of the mantle. These proteins remain occluded within the
              recently formed biominerals. To date, many shell proteins have
              been retrieved, but only a few of them, such as nacreins, have
              clearly identified functions. In this particular case, by
              combining molecular biology and biochemical approaches, we
              performed the molecular characterization of a novel protein that
              we named Upsalin, associated with the nacreous shell of the
              freshwater mussel Unio pictorum. The full sequence of the upsalin
              transcript was obtained by RT-PCR and 5′/3′ RACE, and the
              expression pattern of the transcript was studied by PCR and qPCR.
              Upsalin is a 12 kDa protein with a basic theoretical pI. The
              presence of Upsalin in the shell was demonstrated by extraction
              of the acetic-acid-soluble nacre matrix, purification of a shell
              protein fraction by mono-dimensional preparative SDS-PAGE, and by
              submitting this fraction, after trypsic digestion, to
              nano-LC-MS/MS. In vitro experiments with the purified protein
              showed that it interferes poorly with the precipitation of
              calcium carbonate. Homology searches also could not affiliate
              Upsalin to any other protein of known function, leaving open the
              question of its exact role in shell formation. An antibody raised
              against an immunogenic peptide of Upsalin was found to be
              specific to this protein and was subsequently assayed for
              immunogold localization of the target protein in the shell,
              revealing the ubiquitous presence of Upsalin in the nacreous and
              prismatic layers. Recently, with the application of
              high-throughput proteomic studies to shells, the number of
              candidate proteins without clear functions has been increasing
              exponentially. The Upsalin example highlights the crucial need,
              for the scientific community dealing with biomineralization in
              general, to dedicate the coming years to designing experimental
              approaches, such as gene silencing, that focus on the functions

              differences in specific proteins synthesized by the
              dinoflagellate in the two different growth states. The dimeric,
              14 kDa form of the peripheral membrane peridinin-chlorophyll a

              These results demonstrate that there are major changes in the
              populations of proteins synthesized by Symbiodinium sp. in
              response to the conditions in hospite. Such changes may reflect a
              developmental switch that tailors the physiology of the alga to

              uniform at the regional or global scale2. Here we show the first

              sediment dissolution in Florida Bay",
  author   = "Yates, Kimberlyk and Halley, Robertb",
  abstract = "Water quality and criculation in Florida Bay (a shallow,
              subtropical estuary in south Florida) are highly dependent upon
              the development and evolution of carbonate mud banks distributed
              throughout the Bay. Predicting the effect of natural and
              anthropogenic perturbations on carbonate sedimentation requires
              an understanding of annual, seasonal, and daily variations in the
              biogenic and inorganic processes affecting carbonate sediment
              precipitation and dissolution. In this study, net calcification
              rates were measured over diurnal cycles on 27 d during summer and
              winter from 1999 to 2003 on mud banks and four representative
              substrate types located within basins between mud banks.
              Substrate types that were measured in basins include seagrass
              beds of sparse and intermediate densityThalassia sp., mud bottom,
              and hard bottom communities. Changes in total alkalinity were
              used as a proxy for calcification and dissolution. On 22 d
              (81\%), diurnal variation in rates of net calcification was
              observed. The highest rates of net carbonate sediment production
              (or lowest rates of net dissolution) generally occurred during
              daylight hours and ranged from 2.900 to −0.410 g CaCO3 m−2d−1.
              The lowest rates of carbonate sediment production (or net
              sediment dissolution) occurred at night and ranged from 0.210 to
              −1.900 g CaCO3 m−2 night−1. During typical diurnal cycles,
              dissolution during the night consumed an average of 29\% of
              sediment produced during the day on banks and 68\% of sediment
              produced during the day in basins. Net sediment dissolution also
              occurred during daylight, but only when there was total cloud
              cover, high turbidity, or hypersalinity. Diurnal variation in
              calcification and dissolution in surface waters and surface
              sediments of Florida Bay is linked to cycling of carbon dioxide
              through photosynthesis and respiration. Estimation of long-term
              sediment accumulation rates from diurnal rates of carbonate
              sediment production measured in this study indicates an overall
              average accumulation rate for Florida Bay of 8.7 cm 1000 yr−1 and
              suggests that sediment dissolution plays a more important role
              than sediment transport in loss of sediment from Florida Bay.",

              difficulty calcifying, leading to production of weaker skeletons
              and greater vulnerability to erosion. Alternatively, it has been
              suggested that there will be no significant impact on coral reef
              ecosystems because any changes in saturation state and pH will be
              restored by dissolution of metastable carbonate minerals. To
              resolve this controversy, we employ a physical-biogeochemical box
              model representative of the shallow-water ocean environment.
              Numerical simulations demonstrate that the carbonate saturation
              state of surface waters could significantly decrease and hamper
              the biogenic production of CaCO3 during the twenty-first century.
              Similarly, the average saturation state of marine pore waters
              could decline significantly, inducing dissolution of metastable
              carbonate phases within the pore-water--sediment system. Such
              dissolution could buffer the carbon chemistry of the pore waters,

              Symbiodinum. These dinoflagellates translocate a large part of
              the photosynthetically fixed carbon to the host, which in turn
              uses it for its own needs. Assessing the carbon budget in coral
              tissue is a central question in reef studies that still vexes
              ecophysiologists. The amount of carbon fixed by the symbiotic
              association can be determined by measuring the rate of
              photosynthesis, but the amount of carbon translocated by the
              symbionts to the host and the fate of this carbon are more
              difficult to assess. In the present study, we propose a novel
              approach to calculate the budget of autotrophic carbon in the
              tissue of scleractinian corals, based on a new model and
              measurements made with the stable isotope 13C. Colonies of the
              scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata were incubated in H13CO
              --3-enriched seawater, after which the fate of 13C was followed
              in the symbionts, the coral tissue and the released particulate
              organic carbon (i.e. mucus). Results obtained showed that after
              15 min, ca. 60\% of the carbon fixed was already translocated to
              the host, and after 48 h, this value reached 78\%. However, ca.
              48\% of the photosynthetically fixed carbon was respired by the
              symbiotic association, and 28\% was released as dissolved organic
              carbon. This is different from other coral species, where <1\% of
              the total organic carbon released is from newly fixed carbon.
              Only 23\% of the initially fixed carbon was retained in the
              symbionts and coral tissue after 48 h. Results show that our
              13C-based model could successfully trace the carbon flow from the

              lost from the symbiotic association.",

              during embryonic development of Pomacea canaliculata from an
              embryo without a shell (stage II) to an embryo with a fully
              formed shell (stage III) to understand the roles that proteins
              play in critical developmental events, such as the formation of
              shell, operculum and heart, and the differentiation of head and
              foot. To analyze protein expression during development, we used
              2-DE to detect, MS to analyze, and de novo peptide sequencing
              followed by MS-BLAST to identify the proteins. The de novo
              cross-species protein identification method was adopted because
              of a lack of genomic and proteomic data in the whole class of
              Gastropoda. 2-DE detected approximately 700 protein spots. Among
              the 125 spots that were abundant, 52\% were identified, a marked
              improvement over the conventional direct MS-BLAST method. These
              proteins function in perivitelline fluid utilization, shell
              formation, protein synthesis and folding, and cell cycle and cell
              fate determination, providing evidence to support that this
              embryonic period is a period of dynamic protein synthesis and
              metabolism. The data shall provide a basis for further studies of
              how gastropod embryos respond to natural and human-induced

              this observation, we found that matrix mineralization of MC3T3-E1

              cells of the mantle. These proteins remain occluded within the
              recently formed biominerals. To date, many shell proteins have
              been retrieved, but only a few of them, such as nacreins, have
              clearly identified functions. In this particular case, by
              combining molecular biology and biochemical approaches, we
              performed the molecular characterization of a novel protein that
              we named Upsalin, associated with the nacreous shell of the
              freshwater mussel Unio pictorum. The full sequence of the upsalin
              transcript was obtained by RT-PCR and 5′/3′ RACE, and the
              expression pattern of the transcript was studied by PCR and qPCR.
              Upsalin is a 12 kDa protein with a basic theoretical pI. The
              presence of Upsalin in the shell was demonstrated by extraction
              of the acetic-acid-soluble nacre matrix, purification of a shell
              protein fraction by mono-dimensional preparative SDS-PAGE, and by
              submitting this fraction, after trypsic digestion, to
              nano-LC-MS/MS. In vitro experiments with the purified protein
              showed that it interferes poorly with the precipitation of
              calcium carbonate. Homology searches also could not affiliate
              Upsalin to any other protein of known function, leaving open the
              question of its exact role in shell formation. An antibody raised
              against an immunogenic peptide of Upsalin was found to be
              specific to this protein and was subsequently assayed for
              immunogold localization of the target protein in the shell,
              revealing the ubiquitous presence of Upsalin in the nacreous and
              prismatic layers. Recently, with the application of
              high-throughput proteomic studies to shells, the number of
              candidate proteins without clear functions has been increasing
              exponentially. The Upsalin example highlights the crucial need,
              for the scientific community dealing with biomineralization in
              general, to dedicate the coming years to designing experimental
              approaches, such as gene silencing, that focus on the functions

              the microtubule spindle during mitosis, though molecular evidence
              corroborating its existence has been elusive. In Drosophila, we
              have cloned and characterized a novel nuclear protein, skeletor,
              that we propose is part of a macromolecular complex forming such
              a spindle matrix. Skeletor antibody staining shows that skeletor
              is associated with the chromosomes at interphase, but
              redistributes into a true fusiform spindle structure at prophase,
              which precedes microtubule spindle formation. During metaphase,
              the spindle, defined by skeletor antibody labeling, and the
              microtubule spindles are coaligned. We find that the
              skeletor-defined spindle maintains its fusiform spindle structure
              from end to end across the metaphase plate during anaphase when
              the chromosomes segregate. Consequently, the properties of the
              skeletor-defined spindle make it an ideal substrate for providing
              structural support stabilizing microtubules and counterbalancing
              force production. Furthermore, skeletor metaphase spindles
              persist in the absence of microtubule spindles, strongly implying
              that the existence of the skeletor-defined spindle does not
              require polymerized microtubules. Thus, the identification and
              characterization of skeletor represents the first direct

  abstract = "Phylogenetic trees from multiple genes can be obtained in two
              fundamentally different ways. In one, gene sequences are
              concatenated into a super-gene alignment, which is then analyzed
              to generate the species tree. In the other, phylogenies are
              inferred separately from each gene, and a consensus of these gene
              phylogenies is used to represent the species tree. Here, we have
              compared these two approaches by means of computer simulation,
              using 448 parameter sets, including evolutionary rate, sequence
              length, base composition, and transition/transversion rate bias.
              In these simulations, we emphasized a worst-case scenario
              analysis in which 100 replicate datasets for each evolutionary
              parameter set (gene) were generated, and the replicate dataset
              that produced a tree topology showing the largest number of
              phylogenetic errors was selected to represent that parameter set.
              Both randomly selected and worst-case replicates were utilized to
              compare the consensus and concatenation approaches primarily
              using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method. We find that the
              concatenation approach yields more accurate trees, even when the
              sequences concatenated have evolved with very different
              substitution patterns and no attempts are made to accommodate
              these differences while inferring phylogenies. These results
              appear to hold true for parsimony and likelihood methods as well.
              The concatenation approach shows >95\% accuracy with only 10
              genes. However, this gain in accuracy is sometimes accompanied by
              reinforcement of certain systematic biases, resulting in
              spuriously high bootstrap support for incorrect partitions,
              whether we employ site, gene, or a combined bootstrap resampling
              approach. Therefore, it will be prudent to report the number of
              individual genes supporting an inferred clade in the concatenated
              sequence tree, in addition to the bootstrap support. J. Exp.

  abstract = "High quality carbonate chemistry measurements are required in
              order to fully understand the dynamics of the oceanic carbonate
              system. Seawater pH data with good spatial and temporal coverage
              are particularly critical to apprehend ocean acidification
              phenomena and their consequences. There is a growing need for
              autonomous in situ instruments that measure pH on remote
              platforms. Our aim is to develop an accurate and precise
              autonomous in situ pH sensor for long term deployment on remote
              platforms. The widely used spectrophotometric pH technique is
              capable of the required high-quality measurements. We report a
              key step towards the miniaturization of a colorimetric pH sensor
              with the successful implementation of a simple microfluidic
              design with low reagent consumption. The system is particularly
              adapted to shipboard deployment: high quality data was obtained
              over a period of more than a month during a shipboard deployment
              in northwest European shelf waters, and less than 30 mL of
              indicator was consumed. The system featured a short term
              precision of 0.001 pH (n = 20) and an accuracy within the range
              of a certified Tris buffer (0.004 pH). The quality of the pH
              system measurements have been checked using various approaches:
              measurements of certified Tris buffer, measurement of certified
              seawater for DIC and TA, comparison of measured pH against
              calculated pH from pCO2, DIC and TA during the cruise in
              northwest European shelf waters. All showed that our measurements
              were of high quality. The measurements were made close to in situ
              temperature (+0.2 ̊C) in a sampling chamber which had a
              continuous flow of the ship's underway seawater supply. The
              optical set up was robust and relatively small due to the use of
              an USB mini-spectrometer, a custom made polymeric flow cell and
              an LED light source. The use of a three wavelength LED with
              detection that integrated power across the whole of each LED
              output spectrum indicated that low wavelength resolution
              detectors can be used instead of the current USB mini
              spectrophotometer. Artefacts due to the polychromatic light
              source and inhomogeneity in the absorption cell are shown to have
              a negligible impact on the data quality. The next step in the
              miniaturization of the sensor will be the incorporation of a
              photodiode as detector to replace the spectrophotometer.",

  abstract = "Epithelial-mesenchyme transitions (EMTs) are familiar to all
              scholars of development. Each animal system utilizes an EMT to
              produce mesenchyme cells. In vertebrates, for example, there are
              a number of EMTs that shape the embryo. Early, entry of epiblast
              cells into the primitive streak is followed by the emergence of
              mesoderm via an EMT process. The departure of neural crest cells
              from the margin of the neural folds is an EMT process, and the
              delamination of cells from the endomesoderm to form the
              supporting mesenchyme of the lung, liver, and pancreas are EMTs.
              EMTs are observed in Drosophila following invagination of the
              ventral furrow, and even in Cnidarians, which have only two germ
              layers, yet mesoglial and stem cells delaminate from the
              epithelia and occupy the matrix between the ectoderm and
              endoderm. This review will focus on a classic example of an EMT,
              which occurs in the sea urchin embryo. The primary mesenchyme
              cells (PMCs) ingress from the vegetal plate of this embryo
              precociously and in advance of archenteron invagination. Because
              ingression is precisely timed, the PMC lineage precisely known,
              and the embryo easily observed and manipulated, much has been
              learned about how the ingression of PMCs works in the sea urchin.
              Though the focus of this review is the sea urchin PMCs, there is
              evidence that all EMTs share many common features at both
              cellular and molecular levels, and many of these mechanisms are
              also shown to be involved in tumor progression, especially

              regulated by cell-cell interactions, the molecular basis of which
              are unknown. The Notch intercellular signaling pathway mediates
              the specification of numerous cell fates in both invertebrate and
              vertebrate development. To gain insights into mechanisms
              underlying the diversification of vegetal plate cell types, we
              have identified and made antibodies to a sea urchin homolog of
              Notch (LvNotch). We show that in the early blastula embryo,
              LvNotch is absent from the vegetal pole and concentrated in
              basolateral membranes of cells in the animal half of the embryo.
              However, in the mesenchyme blastula embryo LvNotch shifts
              strikingly in subcellular localization into a ring of cells which
              surround the central vegetal plate. This ring of LvNotch
              delineates a boundary between the presumptive secondary mesoderm
              and presumptive endoderm, and has an asymmetric bias towards the
              dorsal side of the vegetal plate. Experimental perturbations and
              quantitative analysis of LvNotch expression demonstrate that the
              mesenchyme blastula vegetal plate contains both animal/vegetal
              and dorsoventral molecular organization even before this
              territory invaginates to form the archenteron. Furthermore, these
              experiments suggest roles for the Notch pathway in secondary
              mesoderm and endoderm lineage segregation, and in the
              establishment of dorsoventral polarity in the endoderm. Finally,
              the specific and differential subcellular expression of LvNotch
              in apical and basolateral membrane domains provides compelling
              evidence that changes in membrane domain localization of LvNotch

              asymmetries seen along the animal--vegetal axis in the sea urchin
              embryo. Nuclear $\beta$-catenin activates a vegetal signaling
              cascade that mediates micromere specification and specification
              of the endomesoderm in the remaining cells of the vegetal half of
              the embryo. Only a few potential target genes of nuclear
              $\beta$-catenin have been functionally analyzed in the sea urchin
              embryo. Here, we show that SpWnt8, a Wnt8 homolog from
              Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, is zygotically activated
              specifically in 16-cell-stage micromeres in a nuclear
              $\beta$-catenin-dependent manner, and its expression remains
              restricted to the micromeres until the 60-cell stage. At the late
              60-cell stage nuclear $\beta$-catenin-dependent SpWnt8 expression
              expands to the veg2 cell tier. SpWnt8 is the only signaling
              molecule thus far identified with expression localized to the
              16--60-cell stage micromeres and the veg2 tier. Overexpression of
              SpWnt8 by mRNA microinjection produced embryos with multiple
              invagination sites and showed that, consistent with its
              localization, SpWnt8 is a strong inducer of endoderm. Blocking
              SpWnt8 function using SpWnt8 morpholino antisense
              oligonucleotides produced embryos that formed micromeres that
              could transmit the early endomesoderm-inducing signal, but these
              cells failed to differentiate as primary mesenchyme cells.
              SpWnt8-morpholino embryos also did not form endoderm, or
              secondary mesenchyme-derived pigment and muscle cells, indicating
              a role for SpWnt8 in gastrulation and in the differentiation of
              endomesodermal lineages. These results establish SpWnt8 as a

              undergoing some significant conceptual changes. The concept of
              low genetic diversity among symbiotic microalgae and high
              diversity among animal hosts has been challenged, and shown to be
              inaccurate. An increasingly high taxonomic diversity of
              microalgae are now recognized as forming symbioses with a high
              diversity of invertebrates, in marine and freshwater habitats, in
              benthic and pelagic communities. Information from a wide range of
              sources indicates that there is symbiont-host specificity in
              these symbioses at the species level, a realization that is
              completely in agreement with the patterns observed in other
              mutualistic and in parasitic symbioses. There has been a general
              misunderstanding that the less restrictive specificity observed
              under laboratory conditions is equivalent to that occurring in
              the natural environment. The mechanism of selectivity underlying
              the expressed specificity of microalgal-invertebrate symbioses is
              unknown, but evidence supporting the concept of molecular
              signalling between symbionts and hosts is rapidly accumulating.
              Such molecular ''cross-talk'' between symbionts and hosts has now
              been documented in bacteria-legume symbioses, and has also been
              implicated in interactions between plants and bacterial
              pathogens. Many aspects of the physiology, biochemistry and
              ecology of microalgal-invertebrate symbioses are better
              appreciated with the realization that functional diversity
              probably parallels genetic (taxonomic) diversity, and many of the
              apparently controversial aspects of the biology of
              microalgal-invertebrate symbioses can be reconciled by embracing
              this idea. Based on recent new evidence on the structure and
              composition of the photosynthetic apparatus of symbiotic
              dinoflagellates, it is apparent that some of the paradigms of
              functional, and ultimately, ecological aspects of the symbioses
              involving these algae will have to be modified. Of the various
              subdisciplines of the field, the most controversial, and indeed
              confusing, is that pertaining to the acquisition and utilization
              of nitrogen and phosphorus. I have attempted to review the
              various aspects of microalgal-invertebrate symbioses pertaining
              to their taxonomy, genetic diversity and evolution, morphology,
              biochemistry and physiology, as concisely as possible. As I
              believe that the field lacks an overall general theory that would
              guide future research directions, I conclude the article with a
              speculative discourse which hopefully may serve as a focal point.
              I believe that most of the ideas expressed, though not always
              supported by tangible evidence, are cast in the form of
              potentially testable hypotheses",

  abstract = "Some invertebrates have enlisted autotrophic unicellular algae to
              provide a competitive metabolic advantage in nutritionally
              demanding habitats. These symbioses exist primarily but not
              exclusively in shallow tropical oceanic waters where clear water
              and low nutrient levels provide maximal advantage to the
              association. Mostly, the endosymbiotic algae are localized in
              host cells surrounded by a host-derived membrane (symbiosome).
              This anatomy has required adaptation of the host biochemistry to
              allow transport of the normally excreted inorganic nutrients
              (CO2, NH3 and PO43−) to the alga. In return, the symbiont
              supplies photosynthetic products to the host to meet its energy
              demands. Most attention has focused on the metabolism of CO2 and
              nitrogen sources. Carbon-concentrating mechanisms are a feature
              of all algae, but the products exported to the host following
              photosynthetic CO2 fixation vary. Identification of the stimulus
              for release of algal photosynthate in hospite remains elusive.
              Nitrogen assimilation within the symbiosis is an essential
              element in the host's control over the alga. Recent studies have
              concentrated on cnidarians because of the impact of global
              climate change resulting in coral bleaching. The loss of the
              algal symbiont and its metabolic contribution to the host has the

              reef-building species, Montastrea faveolata and Montastrea
              franksi, were sampled over a depth gradient from 1 to 17 m during
              this period of elevated temperature and contained lower densities
              of symbiotic dinoflagellates in deeper corals than seen in
              previous ``nonbleaching'' years. Fluorescence analysis by
              pulse-amplitude modulation fluorometry revealed severe damage to
              photosystem II (PSII) in remaining symbionts within the corals,
              with greater damage indicated at deeper depths. Dinoflagellates
              with the greatest loss in PSII activity also showed a significant
              decline in the D1 reaction center protein of PSII, as measured by
              immunoblot analysis. Laboratory experiments on the
              temperature-sensitive species Montastrea annularis, as well as
              temperature-sensitive and temperature-tolerant cultured symbiotic
              dinoflagellates, confirmed the temperature-dependent loss of PSII
              activity and concomitant decrease in D1 reaction center protein
              seen in symbionts collected from corals naturally bleached on the
              reef. In addition, variation in PSII repair was detected,
              indicating that perturbation of PSII protein turnover rates
              during photoinhibition at elevated temperatures underlies the
              physiological collapse of symbionts in corals susceptible to
              heat-induced bleaching.",

              deep-water species but are thought to be threatened by ocean
              acidification due to oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2.
              Knowledge of the severity of this threat is hampered by our
              limited understanding of the distribution and habitat
              requirements of these corals. Here we estimate the global
              acidification threat to these organisms using a global database
              of cold-water stony coral records and a species distribution
              modelling approach. We parameterised the models using present-day
              environmental data, and then replaced these data with future
              projections of ocean chemistry from the year 2099. We found
              suitable coral habitat to be very heterogeneously distributed,
              being concentrated in the northern North Atlantic and around New
              Zealand. Projected changes in ocean chemistry induced a
              pronounced reduction in habitat suitability in the North
              Atlantic, and a low-to-moderate impact elsewhere under both the
              IPCC IS92a and S650 scenarios. Seamount summits are impacted by
              these changes, but consistently provide more suitable habitat
              than the surrounding seafloor, with around 98\% of seamount
              summits having higher suitability in both future scenarios; this
              is because they lie in shallower waters with a higher aragonite
              saturation state. These results suggest that
              anthropogenic-induced changes in ocean chemistry are likely to
              severely impact cold-water stony coral habitat in the deep-sea of
              the North Atlantic, and that impacts will be less severe
              elsewhere. We predict that coral communities on the summits and
              upper slopes of seamounts will be less susceptible to ocean
              acidification during this century than those on the surrounding
              seafloor, and thus that seamounts may serve as temporary refugia.",

  title    = "The evolution of modern corals and their early history",
  author   = "Stanley, George D",
  abstract = "Scleractinians are a group of calcified anthozoan corals, many of
              which populate shallow-water tropical to subtropical reefs. Most
              of these corals calcify rapidly and their success on reefs is
              related to a symbiotic association with zooxanthellae. These
              one-celled algal symbionts live in the endodermal tissues of
              their coral host and are thought responsible for promoting rapid
              calcification. The evolutionary significance of this symbiosis
              and the implications it holds for explaining the success of
              corals is of paramount importance. Scleractinia stands out as one
              of the few orders of calcified metazoans that arose in Triassic
              time, long after a greater proliferation of calcified metazoan
              orders in the Paleozoic. The origin of this coral group, so
              important in reefs of today, has remained an unsolved problem in
              paleontology. The idea that Scleractinia evolved from older
              Paleozoic rugose corals that somehow survived the Permian mass
              extinction persists among some schools of thought. Paleozoic
              scleractiniamorphs also have been presented as possible
              ancestors. The paleontological record shows the first appearance
              of fossils currently classified within the order Scleractinia to
              be in the Middle Triassic. These earliest Scleractinia provide a
              picture of unexpectedly robust taxonomic diversity and high
              colony integration. Results from molecular biology support a
              polyphyletic evolution for living Scleractinia and the molecular
              clock, calibrated against the fossil record, suggests that two
              major groups of ancestors could extend back to late Paleozoic
              time. The idea that Scleractinia were derived from soft-bodied,
              ``anemone-like'' ancestors that survived the Permian mass
              extinction, has become a widely considered hypothesis. The
              14-million year Mesozoic coral gap stands as a fundamental
              obstacle to verification of many of these ideas. However, this
              obstacle is not a barrier for derivation of scleractinians from
              anemone-like, soft-bodied ancestors. The hypothesis of the
              ephemeral, ``naked coral'', presents the greatest potential for
              solution of the enigma of the origin of scleractinians. It states
              that different groups of soft-bodied, unrelated ``anemone-like''
              anthozoans gave rise to various calcified scleractinian-like
              corals through aragonitic biomineralization. Although there is
              evidence for this phenomenon being more universal in the
              mid-Triassic interval, following a lengthy Early Triassic
              post-extinction perturbation, it appears to have occurred at
              least three other times prior to this interval. This idea
              suggests that, because of ephemeral characteristics, the skeleton
              does not represent a clade of zoantharian evolution but instead
              represents a grade of organization. In the fossil record,
              skeletons may have appeared and disappeared at different times as
              some clades reverted to soft-bodied existence and these phenomena
              could account for notable gaps in the taxonomic and fossil
              record. A fuller understanding and possible solution to the
              problem of the origin of modern corals may be forthcoming.
              However, it will require synthesis of diverse kinds of data and
              an integration of findings from paleobiology, stratigraphy,
              molecular biology, carbonate geochemistry, biochemistry and

              increase in PCO2, prospects for marine biota are of concern.
              Calcifying species may find it difficult to produce their
              skeleton because ocean acidification decreases calcium carbonate
              saturation and accompanying hypercapnia suppresses metabolism.
              However, this may be buffered by enhanced growth and metabolism
              due to warming. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined the
              interactive effects of near-future ocean warming and increased
              acidification/PCO2 on larval development in the tropical sea
              urchin Tripneustes gratilla. Larvae were reared in multifactorial
              experiments in flow-through conditions in all combinations of
              three temperature and three pH/PCO2 treatments. Experiments were
              placed in the setting of projected near future conditions for SE
              Australia, a global change hot spot. Increased acidity/PCO2 and
              decreased carbonate mineral saturation significantly reduced
              larval growth resulting in decreased skeletal length. Increased
              temperature (+3°C) stimulated growth, producing significantly
              bigger larvae across all pH/PCO2 treatments up to a thermal
              threshold (+6°C). Increased acidity (-0.3-0.5 pH units) and
              hypercapnia significantly reduced larval calcification. A +3°C
              warming diminished the negative effects of acidification and
              hypercapnia on larval growth. Conclusions and Significance This
              study of the effects of ocean warming and CO2 driven
              acidification on development and calcification of marine
              invertebrate larvae reared in experimental conditions from the
              outset of development (fertilization) shows the positive and
              negative effects of these stressors. In simultaneous exposure to
              stressors the dwarfing effects of acidification were dominant.
              Reduction in size of sea urchin larvae in a high PCO2 ocean would

              CO2 gas. Targeting expression of ∼1000 genes involved in several
              biological processes, this study captured changes in gene
              expression patterns that characterize the transcriptomic response
              to CO2-driven seawater acidification of developing sea urchin
              larvae. In response to both elevated CO2 scenarios, larvae
              underwent broad scale decreases in gene expression in four major
              cellular processes: biomineralization, cellular stress response,
              metabolism and apoptosis. This study underscores that
              physiological processes beyond calcification are impacted
              greatly, suggesting that overall physiological capacity and not
              just a singular focus on biomineralization processes is essential
              for forecasting the impact of future CO2 conditions on marine
              organisms. Conducted on targeted and vulnerable species,
              genomics-based studies, such as the one highlighted here, have
              the potential to identify potential `weak links' in physiological
              function that may ultimately determine an organism's capacity to
              tolerate future ocean conditions.",

              cause is mandatory adherence to historical monographs that lack
              essential information of all sorts, and also to type specimens,
              if they exist at all, that are commonly unrecognizable fragments
              or are uncharacteristic of the species they are believed to
              represent. Historical problems, including incorrect subsequent
              type species designations, also create uncertainty for many
              well-established genera. The advent of in situ studies in the
              1970s revealed these issues; now molecular technology is again
              changing the taxonomic landscape. The competing methodologies
              involved must be seen in context if they are to avoid becoming an
              additional basis for continuing nomenclatorial instability. To
              prevent this happening, the International Commission on
              Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) will need to focus on rules that
              consolidate well-established nomenclature and allow for the
              designation of new type specimens that are unambiguous, and which
              include both skeletal material and soft tissue for molecular
              study. Taxonomic and biogeographic findings have now become
              linked, with molecular methodologies providing the capacity to
              re-visit past taxonomic decisions, and to extend both taxonomy
              and biogeography into the realm of evolutionary theory. It is
              proposed that most species will ultimately be seen as operational
              taxonomic units that are human rather than natural constructs,
              which in consequence will always have fuzzy morphological,
              genetic, and distribution boundaries. The pathway ahead calls for
              the integration of morphological and molecular taxonomies, and

              carbon dioxide (CO2), is potentially a major threat to coral
              reefs and other marine ecosystems. However, our understanding of
              how natural short-term diurnal CO2 variability in coral reefs
              influences longer term anthropogenic ocean acidification remains
              unclear. Here, we combine observed natural carbonate chemistry
              variability with future carbonate chemistry predictions for a
              coral reef flat in the Great Barrier Reef based on the RCP8.5 CO2
              emissions scenario. Rather than observing a linear increase in
              reef flat partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in concert with rising
              atmospheric concentrations, the inclusion of in situ diurnal
              variability results in a highly nonlinear threefold amplification
              of the pCO2 signal by the end of the century. This significant
              nonlinear amplification of diurnal pCO2 variability occurs as a
              result of combining natural diurnal biological CO2 metabolism
              with long-term decreases in seawater buffer capacity, which
              occurs via increasing anthropogenic CO2 absorption by the ocean.
              Under the same benthic community composition, the amplification
              in the variability in pCO2 is likely to lead to exposure to mean
              maximum daily pCO2 levels of ca. 2100 $\mu$atm, with corrosive
              conditions with respect to aragonite by end-century at our study
              site. Minimum pCO2 levels will become lower relative to the mean
              offshore value (ca. threefold increase in the difference between
              offshore and minimum reef flat pCO2) by end-century, leading to a
              further increase in the pCO2 range that organisms are exposed to.
              The biological consequences of short-term exposure to these
              extreme CO2 conditions, coupled with elevated long-term mean CO2
              conditions are currently unknown and future laboratory
              experiments will need to incorporate natural variability to test
              this. The amplification of pCO2 that we describe here is not

  abstract = "Extensive use of fossil fuels is leading to increasing CO2
              concentrations in the atmosphere and causes changes in the
              carbonate chemistry of the oceans which represents a major sink
              for anthropogenic CO2. As a result, the oceans' surface pH is
              expected to decrease by ca. 0.4 units by the year 2100, a major
              change with potentially negative consequences for some marine
              species. Because of their carbonate skeleton, sea urchins and
              their larval stages are regarded as likely to be one of the more
              sensitive taxa. In order to investigate sensitivity of
              pre-feeding (2 days post-fertilization) and feeding (4 and 7 days
              post-fertilization) pluteus larvae, we raised Strongylocentrotus
              purpuratus embryos in control (pH 8.1 and pCO2 41 Pa e.g. 399
              $\mu$atm) and CO2 acidified seawater with pH of 7.7 (pCO2 134 Pa
              e.g. 1318 $\mu$atm) and investigated growth, calcification and
              survival. At three time points (day 2, day 4 and day 7
              post-fertilization), we measured the expression of 26
              representative genes important for metabolism, calcification and
              ion regulation using RT-qPCR. After one week of development, we
              observed a significant difference in growth. Maximum differences
              in size were detected at day 4 (ca. 10\% reduction in body
              length). A comparison of gene expression patterns using PCA and
              ANOSIM clearly distinguished between the different age groups
              (two-way ANOSIM: Global R = 1) while acidification effects were
              less pronounced (Global R = 0.518). Significant differences in
              gene expression patterns (ANOSIM R = 0.938, SIMPER: 4.3\%
              difference) were also detected at day 4 leading to the hypothesis
              that differences between CO2 treatments could reflect patterns of
              expression seen in control experiments of a younger larva and
              thus a developmental artifact rather than a direct CO2 effect. We
              found an up regulation of metabolic genes (between 10\%and 20\%
              in ATP-synthase, citrate synthase, pyruvate kinase and thiolase
              at day 4) and down regulation of calcification related genes
              (between 23\% and 36\% in msp130, SM30B, and SM50 at day 4). Ion
              regulation was mainly impacted by up regulation of Na+/K+-ATPase
              at day 4 (15\%) and down regulation of NHE3 at day 4 (45\%). We
              conclude that in studies in which a stressor induces an
              alteration in the speed of development, it is crucial to employ
              experimental designs with a high time resolution in order to
              correct for developmental artifacts. This helps prevent
              misinterpretation of stressor effects on organism physiology.",

              the concentration of total ammonia in the extrapallial fluid of
              the giant clam Tridacna squamosa. We also aimed to elucidate
              indirectly whether movements of ammonia and/or protons (H+)
              occurred between the extrapallial fluid and the outer mantle
              epithelium. The pH of the extrapallial fluid of T. squamosa
              exposed to 12 h of light was significantly higher than that of
              clams exposed to 12 h of darkness. Conversely, the total ammonia
              concentration in the extrapallial fluid of the former was
              significantly lower than that of the latter. In addition, the
              glutamine content in the mantle adjacent to the extrapallial
              fluid of clams exposed to 12 h of light was significantly greater
              than that of clams exposed to 12 h of darkness. These results
              suggest that in the extrapallial fluid of T. squamosa exposed to
              light, NH3 combined with H+ as $\mathrm\{NH\}\,^\{+\}_\{4\}$ and
              that $\mathrm\{NH\}\,^\{+\}_\{4\}$ was transported into the
              mantle and used as a substrate for glutamine formation. Injection
              of NH4Cl into the extrapallial fluid led to an instantaneous
              increase in the total ammonia concentration therein, but the
              total ammonia concentration decreased subsequently and returned
              to the control value within 1 h. This is in support of the
              proposition that $\mathrm\{NH\}\,^\{+\}_\{4\}$ could be
              transported from the extrapallial fluid to the mantle. Injection
              of HCl into the extrapallial fluid led to an instantaneous
              decrease in the pH of the extrapallial fluid. However, there was
              a significant increase in pH within 1 h in light or darkness,
              achieving a partial recovery toward the control pH value. The
              increase in pH within this 1‐h period in light or darkness was
              accompanied by a significant decrease in the total ammonia
              concentration in the extrapallial fluid, which supports the
              proposition that H+ could be transported in combination with NH3
              as $\mathrm\{NH\}\,^\{+\}_\{4\}$ . Therefore, our results prompt
              a reexamination of the previous proposition that the removal of

              studied by using the lateral skeleton preparative (LSP) assay,
              viz., a coral nubbin attached to a glass coverslip glued to the
              bottom of a Petri dish. Observations on tissue and skeletal
              growth were made by polarized microscopy and by using vital
              staining. The horizontal distal tissue edges developed thin
              transparent extensions of ectodermal and calicoblastic layers
              only. Four stages (I-IV) of skeletogenesis were observed at these
              edges, underneath the newly developed tissue. In stage I, a thin
              clear layer of coral tissue advanced 3--40 $\mu$m beyond the
              existing LSP peripheral zone, revealing no sign of spiculae
              deposition. At stage II, primary fusiform crystals (1 $\mu$m
              each) were deposited, forming a primary discontinuous skeletal
              front 5--30 $\mu$m away from the previously deposited skeleton.
              During stage III, needle-like crystals appeared, covering the
              primary fusiform crystals. Stage IV involved further lengthening
              of the needle-like crystals, a process that resulted in occlusion
              of the spaces between adjacent crystals. Calcification stages
              I-III developed within hours, whereas stage IV was completed in
              several days to weeks. Two basic skeletal structures,
              ``scattered'' and ``laminar'' skeletons, were formed, integrating
              the growth patterns of the needle-like crystals. High variation
              was recorded in the expression of the four calcification stages,
              either between different locations along a single LSP or between
              different preparations observed at the same diurnal time. All
              four skeletogenesis stages took place during both day and night

              which crystallization occurs; (iv) the polymorph distribution is
              determined by SOM concentration. Thus, through the use of the

              intracellular vesicles, chromosomes, and messenger RNA--protein
              complexes through the cytoplasm of nearly all eukaryotic cells,
              using actin filaments and microtubules as their tracks. A
              prominent theme in these motors is allostery, or communications
              that occur across the enzyme at several nanometer distances.
              Chemical events occurring in the motor's active site, for
              instance, are coordinated with tight binding of the motor to the
              track along which it moves, and then its subsequent release, and
              with mechanical elements that amplify small movements occurring
              near the active site. In the 1980s, researchers used quantitative
              in vitro motility assays, sensitive to single molecules, to study
              two of the three major classes of motor enzymes: the
              microtubule-based kinesin family and the actin-based myosin
              family. In the 1990s, investigators solved the crystal structures

              molecular motor, is a complex that processively moves along
              microtubules in the opposite direction to kinesin 1. Although
              single molecule assays have been applied to dynein, detailed
              structural information on this mammoth machine has remained

              possibly causing a shift from pro-oxidant NADH-producing to

              Changes in cytoskeletal and actin-binding proteins in response to
              several stressors, including ROS, suggest that both are important
              structural and functional elements in responding to stress.
              Disruption of protein homeostasis, e.g., increased abundance of
              molecular chaperones, was severe in response to acute heat

  abstract = "Ocean acidification and warming are expected to threaten the
              persistence of tropical coral reef ecosystems. As coral reefs
              face multiple stressors, the distribution and abundance of corals
              will depend on the successful dispersal and settlement of coral
              larvae under changing environmental conditions. To explore this
              scenario, we used metabolic rate, at holobiont and molecular
              levels, as an index for assessing the physiological plasticity of
              Pocillopora damicornis larvae from this site to conditions of
              ocean acidity and warming. Larvae were incubated for 6 hours in
              seawater containing combinations of CO2 concentration (450 and
              950 µatm) and temperature (28 and 30°C). Rates of larval oxygen
              consumption were higher at elevated temperatures. In contrast,
              high CO2 levels elicited depressed metabolic rates, especially
              for larvae released later in the spawning period. Rates of
              citrate synthase, a rate-limiting enzyme in aerobic metabolism,
              suggested a biochemical limit for increasing oxidative capacity
              in coral larvae in a warming, acidifying ocean. Biological
              responses were also compared between larvae released from adult
              colonies on the same day (cohorts). The metabolic physiology of
              Pocillopora damicornis larvae varied significantly by day of
              release. Additionally, we used environmental data collected on a
              reef in Moorea, French Polynesia to provide information about
              what adult corals and larvae may currently experience in the
              field. An autonomous pH sensor provided a continuous time series
              of pH on the natal fringing reef. In February/March, 2011, pH
              values averaged 8.075$\pm$0.023. Our results suggest that without
              adaptation or acclimatization, only a portion of na{\"\i}ve
              Pocillopora damicornis larvae may have suitable metabolic

              been used to understand evolutionary, immune and developmental
              processes in cnidarians. It has also been subject of several
              ecological studies in order to elucidate reef responses to
              environmental changes such as temperature rise and ocean
              acidification (OA). In these contexts, several nucleic acid
              resources were made available. When combined to a recent
              proteomic analysis of the coral skeletal organic matrix (SOM),
              they enabled the identification of several skeletal matrix
              proteins, making A. millepora into an emerging model for
              biomineralization studies. Here we describe the skeletal
              microstructure of A. millepora skeleton, together with a
              functional and biochemical characterization of its occluded SOM
              that focuses on the protein and saccharidic moieties. The
              skeletal matrix proteins show a large range of isoelectric
              points, compositional patterns and signatures. Besides secreted
              proteins, there are a significant number of proteins with
              membrane attachment sites such as transmembrane domains and GPI
              anchors as well as proteins with integrin binding sites. These
              features show that the skeletal proteins must have strong
              adhesion properties in order to function in the calcifying space.
              Moreover this data suggest a molecular connection between the
              calcifying epithelium and the skeletal tissue during
              biocalcification. In terms of sugar moieties, the enrichment of
              the SOM in arabinose is striking, and the monosaccharide
              composition exhibits the same signature as that of mucus of
              acroporid corals. Finally, we observe that the interaction of the
              acetic acid soluble SOM on the morphology of in vitro grown CaCO3
              crystals is very pronounced when compared with the calcifying
              matrices of some mollusks. In light of these results, we wish to

              phenotype, the mechanism(s) underling the dominant negative
              effects were investigated. DSPP mutations occur in three classes.
              (The first class, the mid-leader missense mutation, Y6D, was not
              investigated in this report.) All other 5′ mutations of DSPP
              result in changes/loss in the first three amino acids
              (isoleucine-proline-valine [IPV]) of mature DSPP or, for the A15V
              missense mutation, some retention of the hydrophobic leader
              sequence. All of this second class of mutations caused mutant
              DSPP to be retained in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) of
              transfected HEK293 cells. Trafficking out of the rER by
              coexpressed normal DSPP was reduced in a dose-responsive manner,
              probably due to formation of Ca2+-dependent complexes with the
              retained mutant DSPP. IPV-like sequences begin many secreted
              Ca2+-binding proteins, and changing the third amino acid to the
              charged aspartate (D) in three other acidic proteins also caused
              increased rER accumulation. Both the leader-retaining A15V and
              the long string of hydrophobic amino acids resulting from all
              known frameshift mutations within the 3′-encoded Ca2+-binding
              repeat domain (third class of mutations) caused retention by
              association of the mutant proteins with rER membranes. More 5′
              frameshift mutations result in longer mutant hydrophobic domains,
              but the milder phenotype, DD, probably due to lower effectiveness
              of the remaining, shorter Ca2+-binding domain in capturing normal
              DSPP protein within the rER. This study presents evidence of a
              shared underlying mechanism of capturing of normal DSPP by two
              different classes of DSPP mutations and offers an explanation for
              the mild (DD-II) versus severe (DGI-II and III) nonsyndromic
              dentin phenotypes. Evidence is also presented that many acidic,

              Peak heights and peak areas were studied visually and with
              bivariate and multivariate statistics. Raman spectra from
              cross-sections provided the most accurate determination of
              collagen quality. A ratio of the 960 cm−1 and 1636 cm−1 peak
              heights provided the most unambiguous distinction between bones
              with well-preserved and poorly-preserved collagen. The 960 cm−1

              human activities could result in increased dissolution of
              metastable carbonate minerals in shallow-water marine sediments.
              In the present study, in situ dissolution of carbonate
              sedimentary particles in Devil's Hole, Bermuda, was observed
              during summer when thermally driven density stratification
              restricted mixing between the bottom water and the surface mixed
              layer and microbial decomposition of organic matter in the
              subthermocline layer produced pCO2 levels similar to or higher
              than those levels anticipated by the end of the 21st century.
              Trends in both seawater chemistry and the composition of
              sediments in Devil's Hole indicate that Mg-calcite minerals are
              subject to selective dissolution under conditions of elevated
              pCO2. The derived rates of dissolution based on observed changes
              in excess alkalinity and estimates of vertical eddy diffusion
              ranged from 0.2 mmol to 0.8 mmol CaCO3 m−2 h−1. On a yearly
              basis, this range corresponds to 175--701 g CaCO3 m−2 year−1; the
              latter rate is close to 50\% of the estimate of the current
              average global coral reef calcification rate of about 1,500 g
              CaCO3 m−2 year−1. Considering a reduction in marine calcification
              of 40\% by the year 2100, or 90\% by 2300, as a result of surface
              ocean acidification, the combination of high rates of carbonate
              dissolution and reduced rates of calcification implies that coral
              reefs and other carbonate sediment environments within the 21st
              and following centuries could be subject to a net loss in
              carbonate material as a result of increasing pCO2 arising from

              reducing the calcification rate of framework builders. In
              addition, acidification is likely to affect the relationship
              between corals and their symbiotic dinoflagellates and the
              productivity of this association. However, little is known about
              how acidification impacts on the physiology of reef builders and
              how acidification interacts with warming. Here, we report on an
              8-week study that compared bleaching, productivity, and
              calcification responses of crustose coralline algae (CCA) and
              branching (Acropora) and massive (Porites) coral species in
              response to acidification and warming. Using a 30-tank
              experimental system, we manipulated CO2 levels to simulate
              doubling and three- to fourfold increases [Intergovernmental
              Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projection categories IV and VI]
              relative to present-day levels under cool and warm scenarios.
              Results indicated that high CO2 is a bleaching agent for corals
              and CCA under high irradiance, acting synergistically with
              warming to lower thermal bleaching thresholds. We propose that
              CO2 induces bleaching via its impact on photoprotective
              mechanisms of the photosystems. Overall, acidification impacted
              more strongly on bleaching and productivity than on
              calcification. Interestingly, the intermediate, warm CO2 scenario
              led to a 30\% increase in productivity in Acropora, whereas high
              CO2 lead to zero productivity in both corals. CCA were most
              sensitive to acidification, with high CO2 leading to negative
              productivity and high rates of net dissolution. Our findings
              suggest that sensitive reef-building species such as CCA may be
              pushed beyond their thresholds for growth and survival within the
              next few decades whereas corals will show delayed and mixed

              atmospheric CO2 represent major global threats to coral reefs,
              and are in many regions exacerbated by local-scale disturbances
              such as overfishing and nutrient enrichment. Our understanding of
              global threats and local-scale disturbances on reefs is growing,
              but their relative contribution to reef resilience and
              vulnerability in the future is unclear. Here, we analyse
              quantitatively how different combinations of CO2 and fishing
              pressure on herbivores will affect the ecological resilience of a
              simplified benthic reef community, as defined by its capacity to
              maintain and recover to coral-dominated states. We use a dynamic
              community model integrated with the growth and mortality
              responses for branching corals (Acropora) and fleshy macroalgae
              (Lobophora). We operationalize the resilience framework by
              parameterizing the response function for coral growth
              (calcification) by ocean acidification and warming, coral
              bleaching and mortality by warming, macroalgal mortality by
              herbivore grazing and macroalgal growth via nutrient loading. The
              model was run for changes in sea surface temperature and water
              chemistry predicted by the rise in atmospheric CO2 projected from
              the IPCC's fossil-fuel intensive A1FI scenario during this
              century. Results demonstrated that severe acidification and
              warming alone can lower reef resilience (via impairment of coral
              growth and increased coral mortality) even under high grazing
              intensity and low nutrients. Further, the threshold at which
              herbivore overfishing (reduced grazing) leads to a coral--algal
              phase shift was lowered by acidification and warming. These
              analyses support two important conclusions: Firstly, reefs
              already subjected to herbivore overfishing and nutrification are
              likely to be more vulnerable to increasing CO2. Secondly, under
              CO2 regimes above 450--500 ppm, management of local-scale
              disturbances will become critical to keeping reefs within an
              Acropora-rich domain.",

              Comparing the shell structure with samples from
              aragonite-supersaturated regions elsewhere under a scanning
              electron microscope, we found severe levels of shell dissolution
              in the undersaturated region alone. According to laboratory
              incubations of intact samples with a range of aragonite
              saturation levels, eight days of incubation in aragonite
              saturation levels of 0.94--1.12 produces equivalent levels of
              dissolution. As deep-water upwelling and CO2 absorption by
              surface waters is likely to increase as a result of human
              activities2, 4, we conclude that upper ocean regions where

  author   = "Berkelmans, Ray and van Oppen, Madeleine J H",
  abstract = "The ability of coral reefs to survive the projected increases in
              temperature due to global warming will depend largely on the
              ability of corals to adapt or acclimatize to increased
              temperature extremes over the next few decades. Many coral
              species are highly sensitive to temperature stress and the number
              of stress (bleaching) episodes has increased in recent decades.
              We investigated the acclimatization potential of Acropora
              millepora, a common and widespread Indo-Pacific hard coral
              species, through transplantation and experimental manipulation.
              We show that adult corals, at least in some circumstances, are
              capable of acquiring increased thermal tolerance and that the
              increased tolerance is a direct result of a change in the
              symbiont type dominating their tissues from Symbiodinium type C
              to D. Our data suggest that the change in symbiont type in our
              experiment was due to a shuffling of existing types already
              present in coral tissues, not through exogenous uptake from the
              environment. The level of increased tolerance gained by the
              corals changing their dominant symbiont type to D (the most
              thermally resistant type known) is around 1--1.5 °C. This is the
              first study to show that thermal acclimatization is causally
              related to symbiont type and provides new insight into the
              ecological advantage of corals harbouring mixed algal
              populations. While this increase is of huge ecological
              significance for many coral species, in the absence of other
              mechanisms of thermal acclimatization/adaptation, it may not be
              sufficient to survive climate change under predicted sea surface
              temperature scenarios over the next 100 years. However, it may be
              enough to `buy time' while greenhouse reduction measures are put

              threshold of between 31 and 32 °C in summer, only 2 to 3 °C
              higher than local mean summer temperatures (29 °C). Summer
              bleaching thresholds for Pocillopora damicornis and A. elseyi
              were 1 °C higher (between 32 and 33 °C). The winter bleaching
              threshold of Pocillopora damicornis was 1 °C lower than its
              summer threshold, indicating that seasonal acclimatisation may
              take place. This seasonal difference raises the possibility that
              at least some corals may be capable of short-term thermal
              acclimatisation. Neither P. damicornis nor A. elseyi showed
              habitat-specific (reef flat versus reef slope) differences in
              bleaching thresholds. Further, colonies of P. damicornis

              determined in the absence of additional stressors (e.g. high
              light) which often co-occur during natural bleaching events. We
              consider the 5-day 50\% bleaching thresholds determined in these
              experiments to be fair indicators of upper thermal limits,
              because >50\% of a sample population died when allowed to recover
              in situ. We found a delay of up to a month in the bleaching
              response of corals following thermal stress, a result that has

              Cleavage appeared to occur between the aragonite tablet layer and

              Anodonta cygnea. In order to evaluate the permeability of the
              paracellular pathway, the OME was incubated under gradients of
              lanthanum and calcium. After lanthanum incubation (4 mM) from the
              basal side, the septate junctions were penetrated completely by
              this tracer. When applied from the apical side, lanthanum
              deposits were located similarly over the entire length of the
              septate junctions up to the first dilatations of the
              intercellular space. Calcium deposits were also present in
              paracellular areas only when OME had been incubated
              simultaneously with calcium (6 mM) and lanthanum (4 mM)
              gradients. Lanthanum and calcium deposits were detected with ESI
              (Electron Spectroscopic Imaging) and identified with EELS
              (Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy). On the other hand,
              electrophysiological observations showed a 48\% reduction of
              conductance when the OME was bathed on both sides with solutions
              containing lanthanum (4 mM) and calcium (6 mM), compared to
              bathing with lanthanum-free solution (control). The conductance
              reduction was 52\% when calcium was removed from the control
              solution. Supported by morphological and physiological evidence,
              it appears that, under in vivo conditions, calcium ions may
              diffuse paracellularly from the haemolymph towards the
              extrapallial fluid and vice-versa across the septate junctions in
              the OME of A. cygnea. Permeability of the septate junctions
              depended proportionally on the calcium concentration in fluids.

              quantitative Western blots, and radioisotopic 14C uptake was used
              to characterize light- and total carbon dioxide (TCO2)-dependent
              carbon fixation, as well as inorganic carbon species preference
              and external carbonic anhydrase activity. * A13 and A20 exhibited
              similar rates of carbon fixation despite cellular concentrations
              of Rubisco being approximately four-fold greater in A13. The
              uptake of CO2 over HCO3 − was found to support the majority of

              developed molecular and morphological tools are now leading to a
              better understanding of the evolutionary history of this

              of skeletal growth and homology is limited, and homoplasy is
              rampant, limiting the usefulness of morphological phylogenetics.
              Molecular phylogenetic hypotheses for the order, which have been
              primarily focused on reef-building corals, differ significantly
              from traditional classification. They suggest that the group is

              mechanisms of immunity to a naturally occurring pathogen.
              Functional studies in Gorgonia ventalina immunity indicate that
              several key pathways and cellular components are involved in
              response to natural microbial invaders, although to date the
              functional and regulatory pathways remain largely un-described.
              This study used short-read sequencing (Illumina GAIIx) to
              identify genes involved in the response of G. ventalina to a
              naturally occurring Aplanochytrium spp. parasite. De novo
              assembly of the G. ventalina transcriptome yielded 90,230 contigs

              in immunity include pattern recognition molecules, anti-microbial
              peptides, and genes involved in wound repair and reactive oxygen
              species formation. Gene enrichment analysis indicated eight
              biological processes were enriched representing 36 genes, largely

              the first report using high-throughput sequencing to characterize

  abstract = "Responses by marine species to ocean acidification (OA) have
              recently been shown to be modulated by external factors including
              temperature, food supply and salinity. However the role of a
              fundamental biological parameter relevant to all organisms, that
              of body size, in governing responses to multiple stressors has
              been almost entirely overlooked. Recent consensus suggests
              allometric scaling of metabolism with body size differs between
              species, the commonly cited `universal' mass scaling exponent (b)
              of ¾ representing an average of exponents that naturally vary.
              One model, the Metabolic-Level Boundaries hypothesis, provides a
              testable prediction: that b will decrease within species under
              increasing temperature. However, no previous studies have
              examined how metabolic scaling may be directly affected by OA. We
              acclimated a wide body-mass range of three common NE Atlantic
              echinoderms (the sea star Asterias rubens, the brittlestars
              Ophiothrix fragilis and Amphiura filiformis) to two levels of
              pCO2 and three temperatures, and metabolic rates were determined
              using closed-chamber respirometry. The results show that contrary
              to some models these echinoderm species possess a notable degree
              of stability in metabolic scaling under different abiotic
              conditions; the mass scaling exponent (b) varied in value between
              species, but not within species under different conditions.
              Additionally, we found no effect of OA on metabolic rates in any
              species. These data suggest responses to abiotic stressors are
              not modulated by body size in these species, as reflected in the
              stability of the metabolic scaling relationship. Such equivalence
              in response across ontogenetic size ranges has important
              implications for the stability of ecological food webs.",

  abstract = "Skeletal homeostasis is determined by systemic hormones and local
              factors. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) are unique because
              they induce the differentiation of mesenchymal cells toward cells

              function of the osteoblast. However, the activity of BMPs needs
              to be tempered by intracellular and extracellular antagonists.
              BMPs bind to specific receptors and signal by phosphorylating the
              cytoplasmic proteins mothers against decapentaplegic (Smad) 1 and
              5, which form heterodimers with Smad 4, and after nuclear
              translocation regulate transcription. BMP antagonists can be
              categorized as pseudoreceptors that compete with signaling
              receptors, inhibitory Smads that block signaling, intracellular
              binding proteins that bind Smad 1 and 5, and factors that induce
              ubiquitination and proteolysis of signaling Smads. In addition, a
              large number of extracellular proteins that bind BMPs and prevent
              their binding to signaling receptors have emerged. They are the
              components of the Spemann organizer, noggin, chordin, and
              follistatin, members of the Dan/Cerberus family, and twisted
              gastrulation. The antagonists tend to be specific for BMPs and

              periostracum reaches its maximum thickness at the shell edge,

              begins within the inner periostracum as fibrous spheruliths,
              which grow towards the shell interior, coalesce and compete
              mutually, originating the aragonitic outer prismatic shell layer.
              Prisms are fibrous polycrystalline aggregates. Internal growth
              lines indicate that their growth front is limited by the mantle

              studies have identified components of a gene regulatory network
              that underlies PMC specification and differentiation. In previous
              work, we identified novel gene products expressed specifically by
              PMCs (Illies, M.R., Peeler, M.T., Dechtiaruk, A.M., Ettensohn,

              one of these gene products, P16, plays an essential role in
              skeletogenesis. P16 is not required for PMC specification,
              ingression, migration, or fusion, but is essential for skeletal
              rod elongation. We have compared the predicted sequences of P16
              from two species and show that this small, acidic protein is
              highly conserved in both structure and function. The predicted
              amino acid sequence of P16 and the subcellular localization of a
              GFP-tagged form of the protein suggest that P16 is enriched in
              the plasma membrane. It may function to receive signals required
              for skeletogenesis or may play a more direct role in the
              deposition of biomineral. Finally, we place P16 downstream of
              Alx1 in the PMC gene network, thereby linking the network to a
              specific ``effector'' protein involved in biomineralization.",

              strengthen effective management measures. A first step in
              studying the effects of MRAs at a global scale is to estimate
              their socioeconomic benefits, which are captured here by three
              indicators: the amount of participation, employment and direct
              expenditure by users. A database of reported expenditure on MRAs
              was compiled for 144 coastal countries. A meta-analysis was then
              performed to calculate the yearly global benefits of MRAs in
              terms of expenditure, participation and employment. It is
              estimated that 121 million people a year participate in MRAs,

              using the identification of antibody-antigen complexes on
              enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and gel electrophoresis. Moa
              bone provided an ancient comparison for the effectiveness of bone
              extraction protocols tested on ostrich bone. For the
              immunological part of this study, we focused on collagen I,
              osteocalcin, and hemoglobin because collagen and osteocalcin are
              the most abundant proteins in the mineralized extracellular
              matrix and hemoglobin is common in the vasculature. Most of these
              procedures demineralize the bone first, and then the remaining
              organics are chemically extracted. We found that the use of
              hydrochloric acid, rather than ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid,
              for demineralization resulted in the cleanest extractions because
              the acid was easily removed. In contrast, the use of
              ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid resulted in smearing upon
              electrophoretic separation, possibly indicating these samples
              were not as pure. The denaturing agents sodium dodecyl sulfate,
              urea, and guanidine HCl have been used extensively for the
              solubilization of proteins in non-biomineralized tissue, but only
              the latter has been used on bone. We show that all three
              denaturing agents are effective for extracting bone proteins. One
              additional method tested uses ammonium bicarbonate as a
              solubilizing buffer that is more appropriate for post-extraction
              analyses (e.g., proteomics) by removing the need for desalting.
              We found that both guanidine HCl and ammonium bicarbonate were
              effective for extracting many bone proteins, resulting in similar
              electrophoretic patterns. With the increasing use of proteomics,
              a new generation of scientists are now interested in the study of

              investigated. Bulk analyses using Raman and infrared
              spectroscopic methods revealed that the skeletons were

              the genus Symbiodinium, which influences many aspects of the
              host's physiology including calcification. Coral calcification is
              a biologically controlled process performed by the host that
              takes place several membranes away from the site of
              photosynthesis performed by the symbiont. Although it is well
              established that light accelerates CaCO3 deposition in
              reef-building corals (commonly referred to as light-enhanced
              calcification), the complete physiological mechanism behind the
              process is not fully understood. To better comprehend the coral
              calcification process, a series of laboratory experiments were
              conducted in the major Caribbean reef-building species
              Montastraea faveolata, to evaluate the effect of glycerol
              addition and/or the super-saturation of oxygen in the seawater.
              These manipulations were performed in bleached and unbleached
              corals, to separate the effect of photosynthesis from
              calcification. The results suggest that under normal
              physiological conditions, a 42\% increase in seawater oxygen
              concentration promotes a twofold increase in dark-calcification
              rates relative to controls. On the other hand, the results
              obtained using bleached corals suggest that glycerol is required,
              as a metabolic fuel, in addition to an oxygenic environment in a
              symbiosis that has been disrupted. Also, respiration rates in
              symbiotic corals that were pre-incubated in light conditions
              showed a kinetic limitation, whereas corals that were
              pre-incubated in darkness were oxygen limited, clearly
              emphasizing the role of oxygen in this regard. These findings
              indicate that calcification in symbiotic corals is not strictly a
              ``light-enhanced'' or ``dark-repressed'' process, but rather, the
              products of photosynthesis have a critical role in calcification,
              which should be viewed as a ``photosynthesis-driven'' process.

  title    = "Coral reef calcifiers buffer their response to ocean
              acidification using both bicarbonate and carbonate",
  author   = "Comeau, S and Carpenter, R C and Edmunds, P J",
  abstract = "Central to evaluating the effects of ocean acidification (OA) on
              coral reefs is understanding how calcification is affected by the
              dissolution of CO2 in sea water, which causes declines in
              carbonate ion concentration [CO32−] and increases in bicarbonate
              ion concentration [HCO3−]. To address this topic, we manipulated
              [CO32−] and [HCO3−] to test the effects on calcification of the
              coral Porites rus and the alga Hydrolithon onkodes, measured from
              the start to the end of a 15-day incubation, as well as in the
              day and night. [CO32−] played a significant role in light and
              dark calcification of P. rus, whereas [HCO3−] mainly affected
              calcification in the light. Both [CO32−] and [HCO3−] had a
              significant effect on the calcification of H. onkodes, but the
              strongest relationship was found with [CO32−]. Our results show
              that the negative effect of declining [CO32−] on the
              calcification of corals and algae can be partly mitigated by the
              use of HCO3− for calcification and perhaps photosynthesis. These
              results add empirical support to two conceptual models that can
              form a template for further research to account for the

              regulatory kinases. Photoreceptor synaptic proteins, as well as
              the lectins Peanut agglutinin and Griffonia simplicifolia

              Anoctamin 1, 2, and 10 were found to be expressed in the eye.
              Anoctamin 2 was expressed as a splice variant that includes exon

              distinct effects on osteoblast differentiation, depending on cell

              TGF-$\beta$. In a search for key regulators of osteoblast
              differentiation we have used microarray analysis to identify
              genes which are differentially regulated by BMP2 and TGF-$\beta$.
              Within the first 24 h following the onset of differentiation, 61
              BMP2-regulated genes were identified of which the BMP2 effect was
              counteracted by TGF-$\beta$. The majority of these differentially
              expressed transcripts are related to signal transduction.
              Notably, our data show that three Notch signal transduction
              pathway genes, Lfng, Hey1, and Hes1, are differentially regulated
              by BMP2 and TGF-$\beta$. This suggests that these genes might

              Acropora muricata were sub-divided and distributed among three
              110-L aquaria, and exposed to phosphate levels of 0.09, 0.20, and
              0.50 mg L− 1 for four months. Total skeletal length, living
              tissue length, weight, branch production, and polyp extension
              were measured. Linear extension and tissue growth increased under
              all conditions. Growth rates were highest at a phosphate
              concentration of 0.50 mg L− 1. Weight increased through time,
              graded from low to high with phosphate concentration. Density
              decreased through time, and was significantly lowest in the high
              phosphate treatment. Phosphate concentration produced no visible
              effects of stress on the corals, as indicated by polyp extension
              and lack of mortality. It is suggested that the phosphate
              enhanced growth was due to increased zooxanthellar populations
              and photosynthetic production within the coral. Skeletal density
              reduction may be due to phosphate binding at the calcifying
              surface and the creation of a porous and structurally weaker
              calcium carbonate/calcium phosphate skeleton. Increased phosphate
              concentrations, often characteristic of eutrophic conditions,
              caused increased coral growth but also a more brittle skeleton.
              The latter is likely more susceptible to breakage and damage from
              other destructive forces (e.g., bioerosion) and makes increased
              coral growth a poor indicator of reef health.",

              features. Here, we define a systematic relationship between the
              ability of biomolecules in solution to promote the growth of
              calcite (CaCO3) and their net negative molecular charge and
              hydrophilicity. The degree of enhancement depends on peptide
              composition, but not on peptide sequence. Data analysis shows
              that this rate enhancement arises from an increase in the kinetic
              coefficient. We interpret the mechanism of growth enhancement to
              be a catalytic process whereby biomolecules reduce the magnitude
              of the diffusive barrier, E k, by perturbations that displace
              water molecules. The result is a decrease in the energy barrier
              for attachment of solutes to the solid phase. This previously

              charge. This insight may contribute to an improved understanding

              shell or pearl nacre requires the participation of a diverse set

              Although self-assembly processes have been identified for several
              nacre proteins, these proteins do not contain known globular
              protein--protein binding domains. Thus, we hypothesize that other

              protein--protein assembly processes and ultimately aragonite
              biosynthesis.Results: Of 39 mollusk aragonite-associated protein
              sequences, 100\% contain at least one region of intrinsic
              disorder or unfolding, with the highest percentages found in

              intracrystalline proteins. In some instances, these intrinsically
              disordered regions were identified as bind/fold sequences, and a
              limited number correlate with known biomineral-relevant
              sequences. Interestingly, 95\% of the aragonite-associated

              ubiquitylated proteins in the prismatic layer of the shell was
              detected with a combination of western blot and immunogold

              Edman degradation and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry
              (LC/MS). Antibody injection in vivo resulted in large amounts of
              calcium carbonate randomly accumulating on the surface of the
              nacreous layer. These ubiquitylated proteins could bind to
              specific faces of calcite and aragonite, which are the two main
              mineral components of the shell. In the in vitro calcium
              carbonate crystallization assay, they could reduce the rate of
              calcium carbonate precipitation and induce the calcite formation.

              functions of the EDTA-soluble matrix of the prismatic layer were
              changed. Their potency to inhibit precipitation of calcium

              ubiquitylation is involved in shell formation. Although the

              However, the basic proteins were not expected to be components of

              staining analysis and ultrastructural observation with the aid of
              transmission electron microscope (TEM) demonstrated distinct
              features of the epithelium in four different regions of the

              there exists a proliferation ``hot spot'' in the outer epithelial
              cells of central zone and the proliferation ability decreases
              progressively from this ``hot spot'' towards the marginal zone;
              the whole mantle's differentiation occurs continuously with its
              growth and the direction is from the proliferation `hot spot'
              (central zone) towards the marginal zone. Furthermore, another
              interesting result was found when the proliferation rate was
              investigated together with the tidal rhythm: the proliferation
              activity was found to be closely correlated with the tidal
              rhythm, indicating that the mantle outer epithelia's

              fundamental changes in seawater chemistry that could have
              dramatic impacts on biological ecosystems in the upper ocean.
              Estimates based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
              (IPCC) business-as-usual emission scenarios suggest that
              atmospheric CO2 levels could approach 800 ppm near the end of the
              century. Corresponding biogeochemical models for the ocean
              indicate that surface water pH will drop from a pre-industrial
              value of about 8.2 to about 7.8 in the IPCC A2 scenario by the
              end of this century, increasing the ocean's acidity by about
              150\% relative to the beginning of the industrial era. In
              contemporary ocean water, elevated CO2 will also cause
              substantial reductions in surface water carbonate ion
              concentrations, in terms of either absolute changes or fractional
              changes relative to pre-industrial levels. For most open-ocean
              surface waters, aragonite undersaturation occurs when carbonate
              ion concentrations drop below approximately 66 µmol kg-1. The

              start to occur by about 2020 in the Arctic Ocean and 2050 in the
              Southern Ocean. By 2050, all of the Arctic will be undersaturated
              with respect to aragonite, and by 2095, all of the Southern Ocean
              and parts of the North Pacific will be undersaturated. For
              calcite, undersaturation occurs when carbonate ion concentration
              drops below 42 µmol kg-1. By 2095, most of the Arctic and some
              parts of the Bering and Chukchi seas will be undersaturated with
              respect to calcite. However, in most of the other ocean basins,

              Stylophora are more diverse in the western Indian Ocean and in
              the Red Sea than in the central Indo-Pacific. However, the
              morphology of corals is often a poor predictor of their actual
              biodiversity: hence, we conducted a genetic survey of Stylophora
              corals collected in Madagascar, Okinawa, the Philippines and New
              Caledonia in an attempt to find out the true number of species in
              these various locations.RESULTS:A molecular phylogenetic analysis
              of the mitochondrial ORF and putative control region concurs with
              a haploweb analysis of nuclear ITS2 sequences in delimiting three
              species among our dataset: species A and B are found in
              Madagascar whereas species C occurs in Okinawa, the Philippines
              and New Caledonia. Comparison of ITS1 sequences from these three
              species with data available online suggests that species C is
              also found on the Great Barrier Reef, in Malaysia, in the South
              China Sea and in Taiwan, and that a distinct species D occurs in
              the Red Sea. Shallow-water morphs of species A correspond to the
              morphological description of Stylophora madagascarensis, species
              B presents the morphology of Stylophora mordax, whereas species C
              comprises various morphotypes including Stylophora pistillata and
              Stylophora mordax.CONCLUSIONS:Genetic analysis of the coral genus
              Stylophora reveals species boundaries that are not congruent with
              morphological traits. Of the four hypotheses that may explain
              such discrepancy (phenotypic plasticity, morphological stasis,
              morphological convergence, and interspecific hybridization), the
              first two appear likely to play a role but the fourth one is
              rejected since mitochondrial and nuclear markers yield congruent
              species delimitations. The position of the root in our molecular
              phylogenies suggests that the center of origin of Stylophora is
              located in the western Indian Ocean, which probably explains why
              this genus presents a higher biodiversity in the westernmost part
              of its area of distribution than in the ``Coral Triangle''.",

              into seawater enriched in the rare earth element Tb3 + as well as
              stable isotopes of calcium, strontium, and barium. Subsequent
              NanoSIMS ion images of each coral skeleton were used to follow
              uptake dynamics. These images show a continuous region
              corresponding to new growth that is homogeneously enriched in
              each tracer. Isotope ratio profiles across the new growth
              boundary transition rapidly from natural abundance ratios to a
              ratio matching the enriched culture solution. The location of
              this transition is the same for each element, within analytical

              including the dissimilar ion terbium, which has no known

              saturation state of seawater ($\Omega$SW). Skeletal Sr/Ca is a
              common proxy for temperature while $\Omega$SW is a parameter that
              varied in the past ocean and is predicted to change with
              continued ocean acidification. Five adult branches of the surface
              coral Stylophora pistillata were grown at different $\Omega$SW
              from 2.7 to 4.9 (pH of 7.9--8.5) but at a constant temperature of
              25 °C. Despite a large range of growth parameters and a twofold
              range in calcification rates, the average skeletal Sr/Ca of coral
              exposed to each condition are within 1.2\% of each other
              (2$\sigma$ std. dev. of the 5 means). Furthermore, the average
              skeletal Sr/Ca measured in this study agrees with the results of
              two previous coral culture experiments conducted at the same
              temperature but where $\Omega$SW was not controlled. These
              results suggest that aragonite saturation has little or no
              influence on Sr/Ca paleothermometry over the range of $\Omega$SW
              investigated. Combined with existing data for low $\Omega$SW
              conditions, our results were used to elucidate the mechanisms
              controlling calcifying fluid acid--base chemistry during coral
              biomineralization. Assuming that coral drive precipitation
              through alkalinity pumping, our data suggest that this pumping
              occurs until the calcifying fluid reaches a target pH. Below a
              threshold $\Omega$SW bounded by 1 < $\Omega$SW < 2.4, however,
              coral do not pump enough alkalinity to reach the target pH and
              instead pump a maximal but finite amount of alkalinity. In this
              low $\Omega$SW regime, calcifying fluid pH is expected to
              decrease with $\Omega$SW. The interplay between these two
              alkalinity pumping regimes and external seawater composition
              explain the full range of observed Sr/Ca sensitivity to
              $\Omega$SW and suggest that surface coral may become increasingly
              sensitive to ocean acidification below a threshold $\Omega$SW

              that are predicted in the global environment over the next
              century will lie in their physiological mechanisms of
              acclimatization. Corals display rapid modifications in behavior,
              morphology and physiology enabling them to photoacclimate to
              changing light conditions, a scenario that demonstrates
              considerable biological flexibility. Here we argue that the
              acclimatization mechanisms in corals are fundamentally similar to
              those exhibited by other invertebrate taxa. We discuss protein
              metabolism as a mechanism underlying acclimatization responses in
              reef corals, and explore the relationship between protein
              turnover, metabolic rate, growth rate, and acclimatization
              capacity. Our preliminary analyses suggest that corals with low
              growth rates ($\mu$Ca/mgN/h) and high metabolic rates
              ($\mu$O2/cm2/hr), such as the massive species, acclimatize more
              effectively than those with high growth rates and low metabolic
              rates, a feature that is characteristic of branching species. We
              conclude that studies of protein turnover, combined with
              temporally relevant investigations into the dynamic aspects of
              coral dinoflagellate symbioses will provide considerable insight
              into why corals exhibit such a high level of variation in

              The results show a nonlinear increase in calcification rate as a
              function of aragonite saturation level. Calcification increases
              nearly 3-fold when aragonite saturation increases from 98\% to
              390\%, i.e., close to the typical present saturation state of

              Although many studies have attempted to associate specific
              mutation types with phenotypic severity, the molecular and
              mesoscale mechanisms by which a single point mutation influences
              the mechanical behavior of tissues at multiple length scales

              mesoscale simulation that OI mutations severely compromise the
              mechanical properties of collagenous tissues at multiple scales,
              from single molecules to collagen fibrils. Mutations that lead to
              the most severe OI phenotype correlate with the strongest
              effects, leading to weakened intermolecular adhesion, increased
              intermolecular spacing, reduced stiffness, as well as a reduced
              failure strength of collagen fibrils. We find that these
              molecular-level changes lead to an alteration of the stress
              distribution in mutated collagen fibrils, causing the formation
              of stress concentrations that induce material failure via
              intermolecular slip. We believe that our findings provide insight
              into the microscopic mechanisms of this disease and lead to
              explanations of characteristic OI tissue features such as reduced
              mechanical strength and a lower cross-link density. Our study
              explains how single point mutations can control the breakdown of

              constituents of the extracellular matrix of bone and dentin. The
              acidic phosphoproteins of bone contain more glutamic acid than
              aspartic acid and a lower serine content than either. On the
              other hand, the major dentin acidic phosphoproteins,
              phosphophoryns, have been defined as aspartic acid- and
              serine-rich proteins, with a lesser content of glutamic acid.
              Both sets of phosphoproteins have been implicated as key
              participants in regulating mineralization, but it has been
              difficult to unify their mechanisms of action. We have now
              identified, by cDNA cloning, a new serine-rich acidic protein of
              the dentin matrix, AG1, with a composition intermediate between
              the bone acidic proteins and dentin phosphophoryns. AG1 has

              initiate skeletal formation is, therefore, warranted. Here, we
              present a thorough, multiscale, microscopic and spectroscopic

              damicornis recruits, from 12 h to 22 days after settlement in
              aquarium on a flat substrate. Six growth stages are defined,
              primarily based on appearance and morphology of successively
              deposited skeletal structures, with the following average
              formation time-scales: A (10 days). Raman and energy dispersive
              X-ray spectroscopy indicate the presence of calcite among the
              earliest components of the basal plate, which consist of
              micrometer-sized, rod-shaped crystals with rhomboidal habit. All
              later CaCO3 skeletal structures are composed exclusively of
              aragonite. High-resolution scanning electron microscopy reveals
              that, externally, all CaCO3 deposits consist of <100 nm granular
              units. Fusiform, dumbbell-like, and semispherulitic structures,
              25--35 µm in longest dimension, occur only during the earliest
              stages (Stages A--C), with morphologies similar to structures
              formed abiotically or induced by organics in in vitro carbonate
              crystallization experiments. All other skeletal structures of the
              basal plate are composed of vertically extending lamellar bundles
              of granules. From Stage D, straight fibrils, 40--45 nm in width
              and presumably of organic composition, form bridges between these
              aragonitic bundles emerging from the growing front of fusing

              protein, nacrein. A novel sensitive sandwich enzyme-linked
              immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was established to quantify nacrein.
              Mantle explant culture was demonstrated to provide dissociated
              tissue cells with high viability. Single dissociated cell types
              from explant culture were separated by density in a discontinuous
              Percoll gradient. The outer epithelial cells were isolated from
              other cell types by their higher density and identified by
              immunolabeling and ultrastructure analysis. ELISA assays revealed
              that the outer epithelial cells retained the ability to secrete
              nacrein in vitro. Moreover, increased nacrein secretion resulted
              from an increased Ca2+ concentration in the culture media of the
              outer epithelial cells, in a concentration-dependent manner.
              These results confirm that outer epithelial cell culture and the
              ELISA method are useful tools for studying the regulatory
              mechanisms of shell biomineralization.",

  abstract = "Almost all mineralized tissues contain proteins that are
              unusually acidic. As they are also often intimately associated
              with the mineral phase, they are thought to fulfill important
              functions in controlling mineral formation. Relatively little is
              known about these important proteins, because their acidic nature
              causes technical difficulties during purification and
              characterization procedures. Much effort has been made to
              overcome these problems, particularly in the study of
              mollusk-shell formation. To date about 16 proteins from
              mollusk-shell organic matrices have been sequenced, but only two
              are unusually rich in aspartic and glutamic acids. Here we
              screened a cDNA library made from the mRNA of the shell-forming
              cells of a bivalve, Atrina rigida, using probes for short
              Asp-containing repeat sequences, and identified ten different
              proteins. Using more specific probes designed from one subgroup
              of conserved sequences, we obtained the full sequences of a
              family of seven aspartic acid-rich proteins, which we named
              ``Asprich''; a subfamily of the unusually acidic shell-matrix
              proteins. Polyclonal antibodies raised against a synthetic
              peptide of the conserved acidic1 domain of these proteins reacted
              specifically with the matrix components of the calcitic prismatic
              layer, but not with those of the aragonitic nacreous layer. Thus
              the Asprich proteins are constituents of the prismatic layer
              shell matrix. We can identify different domains within these
              sequences, including a signal peptide characteristic of proteins
              destined for extracellular secretion, a conserved domain rich in
              aspartic acid that contains a sequence very similar to the
              calcium-binding domain of Calsequestrin, and another domain rich
              in aspartic acid, that varies between the seven sequences. We
              also identified a domain with DEAD repeats that may have
              Mg-binding capabilities. Although we do not know, as yet, the
              function of these proteins, their generally conserved sequences
              do indicate that they might well fulfill basic functions in shell
              formation.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND:Ecosystems worldwide are suffering the consequences of
              anthropogenic impact. The diverse ecosystem of coral reefs, for
              example, are globally threatened by increases in sea surface
              temperatures due to global warming. Studies to date have focused
              on determining genetic diversity, the sequence variability of
              genes in a species, as a proxy to estimate and predict the
              potential adaptive response of coral populations to environmental
              changes linked to climate changes. However, the examination of
              natural gene expression variation has received less attention.
              This variation has been implicated as an important factor in
              evolutionary processes, upon which natural selection can
              act.RESULTS:We acclimatized coral nubbins from six colonies of
              the reef-building coral Acropora millepora to a common garden in
              Heron Island (Great Barrier Reef, GBR) for a period of four weeks
              to remove any site-specific environmental effects on the
              physiology of the coral nubbins. By using a cDNA microarray
              platform, we detected a high level of gene expression variation,
              with 17\% (488) of the unigenes differentially expressed across
              coral nubbins of the six colonies (jsFDR-corrected, p<0.01).
              Among the main categories of biological processes found
              differentially expressed were transport, translation, response to
              stimulus, oxidation-reduction processes, and apoptosis. We found
              that the transcriptional profiles did not correspond to the
              genotype of the colony characterized using either an intron of
              the carbonic anhydrase gene or microsatellite loci
              markers.CONCLUSION:Our results provide evidence of the high
              inter-colony variation in A. millepora at the transcriptomic
              level grown under a common garden and without a correspondence
              with genotypic identity. This finding brings to our attention the
              importance of taking into account natural variation between reef
              corals when assessing experimental gene expression differences.
              The high transcriptional variation detected in this study is
              interpreted and discussed within the context of adaptive
              potential and phenotypic plasticity of reef corals. Whether this
              variation will allow coral reefs to survive to current challenges
              remains unknown.",

              sensitive to ocean acidification. To improve predictions of coral
              reef response to acidification, we need to better characterize
              the natural range of variability of pH, partial pressure of
              carbon dioxide (pCO2) and calcium carbonate saturation states
              ($\Omega$). In this study, autonomous sensors for pH and pCO2
              were deployed on Media Luna reef, Puerto Rico over three seasons
              from 2007 to 2008. High temporal resolution CaCO3 saturation
              states were calculated from the in situ data, giving a much more
              detailed characterization of reef saturation states than
              previously possible. Reef pH, pCO2 and aragonite saturation
              ($\Omega$Ar) ranged from 7.89 to 8.17 pH units, 176--613 $\mu$atm
              and 2.7--4.7, respectively, in the range characteristic of most
              other previously studied reef ecosystems. The diel pH, pCO2 and
              $\Omega$ cycles were also large, encompassing about half of the
              seasonal range of variability. Warming explained about 50\% of
              the seasonal supersaturation in mean pCO2, with the remaining
              supersaturation primarily due to net heterotrophy and net CaCO3
              production. Net heterotrophy was likely driven by
              remineralization of mangrove derived organic carbon which
              continued into the fall, sustaining high pCO2 levels until early
              winter when the pCO2 returned to offshore values. As a
              consequence, the reef was a source of CO2 to the atmosphere
              during the summer and fall and a sink during winter, resulting in
              a net annual source of 0.73 $\pm$ 1.7 mol m−2 year−1. These
              results show that reefs are exposed to a wide range of saturation
              states in their natural environment. Mean $\Omega$Ar levels will
              drop to 3.0 when atmospheric CO2 increases to 500 $\mu$atm and
              $\Omega$Ar will be less than 3.0 for greater than 70\% of the
              time in the summer. Long duration exposure to these low
              $\Omega$Ar levels are expected to significantly decrease
              calcification rates on the reef.",

              a settled polyp, which under favorable conditions will establish
              a future colony, is critical for the survival of corals. However,
              in contrast to the situation in other animals, e.g., frogs and
              insects, little is known about the molecular basis of coral
              metamorphosis. We have begun to redress this situation with
              previous microarray studies, but there is still a great deal to
              learn. In the present paper we have utilized a different
              technology, subtractive hybridization, to characterize genes
              differentially expressed across this developmental transition and
              to compare the success of this method to microarray.
              Methodology/Principal Findings Suppressive subtractive
              hybridization (SSH) was used to identify two pools of transcripts
              from the coral, Acropora millepora. One is enriched for
              transcripts expressed at higher levels at the pre-settlement
              stage, and the other for transcripts expressed at higher levels
              at the post-settlement stage. Virtual northern blots were used to
              demonstrate the efficacy of the subtractive hybridization
              technique. Both pools contain transcripts coding for proteins in
              various functional classes but transcriptional regulatory
              proteins were represented more frequently in the post-settlement
              pool. Approximately 18\% of the transcripts showed no significant
              similarity to any other sequence on the public databases.
              Transcripts of particular interest were further characterized by
              in situ hybridization, which showed that many are regulated
              spatially as well as temporally. Notably, many transcripts
              exhibit axially restricted expression patterns that correlate
              with the pool from which they were isolated. Several transcripts
              are expressed in patterns consistent with a role in
              calcification. Conclusions We have characterized over 200
              transcripts that are differentially expressed between the planula
              larva and post-settlement polyp of the coral, Acropora millepora.

              protein identified in the dentin matrix is phosphophoryn (PP). It
              is highly acidic in nature because of a high content of aspartic
              acid and phosphate groups on serines. The 244-residue
              carboxyl-terminal domain of rat PP, predominantly containing the
              aspartic acid-serine repeats, has been cloned, and the
              corresponding protein has been expressed recombinantly in
              Escherichia coli. This portion of PP, named DMP2 (dentin matrix
              protein 2), is not phosphorylated by the bacteria and thus
              provided a means to study the function of the phosphate groups,
              the major post-translational modification of native PP. The
              recombinant DMP2 (rDMP2) possessed much lower calcium binding

              demonstrated that PP folds to a compact globular structure upon

              In vitro nucleation experiments showed that PP could nucleate
              plate-like apatite crystals in pseudophysiological buffer,

              calcium phosphate to apatite crystals under the same experimental

              CO2 becomes the product of a negative effect on saturation state
              and a positive effect on gross carbon fixation, depending upon
              which dominates, the calcification response can be either
              positive or negative. This may help explain how the range of
              coral responses found in different studies of ocean acidification
              can be obtained.",

  abstract = "The dual character of corals, that they are both auto- and
              heterotrophs, was recognized early in the twentieth Century. It
              is generally accepted that the symbiotic association between
              corals and their endosymbiotic algae (called zooxanthellae) is
              fundamental to the development of coral reefs in oligotrophic
              tropical oceans because zooxanthellae transfer the major part of
              their photosynthates to the coral host (autotrophic nutrition).
              However, numerous studies have confirmed that many species of
              corals are also active heterotrophs, ingesting organisms ranging
              from bacteria to mesozooplankton. Heterotrophy accounts for
              between 0 and 66\% of the fixed carbon incorporated into coral
              skeletons and can meet from 15 to 35\% of daily metabolic
              requirements in healthy corals and up to 100\% in bleached
              corals. Apart from this carbon input, feeding is likely to be
              important to most scleractinian corals, since nitrogen,
              phosphorus, and other nutrients that cannot be supplied from
              photosynthesis by the coral's symbiotic algae must come from
              zooplankton capture, particulate matter or dissolved compounds. A
              recent study showed that during bleaching events some coral
              species, by increasing their feeding rates, are able to maintain
              and restore energy reserves. This review assesses the importance
              and effects of heterotrophy in tropical scleractinian corals. We
              first provide background information on the different food
              sources (from dissolved organic matter to meso- and
              macrozooplankton). We then consider the nutritional inputs of
              feeding. Finally, we review feeding effects on the different
              physiological parameters of corals (tissue composition,
              photosynthesis and skeletal growth).",

              shallow reef fronts at Lizard Island, on the Great Barrier Reef,
              Australia. Ten large (1 m2) collecting trays were deployed and
              cleared annually for 4 years at each of two sites at the base
              (8-12 m depth) of the steeply-sloping, fringing reef. The rate of
              export of coral fragments down the reef slope was very high: an
              average of 132 fragments weighing 1.87 kg was recorded each year
              per meter of reef front. A mean of 2.25\% of the fragments

              census, yielding an average rate of colonization onto the reef

              Reworking of hard calcareous substrates towards the slope
              promotes reef growth by two mechanisms: (1) passive dispersal of
              live coral fragments to peripheral, soft-sediment habitats that
              are unsuitable for larval settlement, and (2) subsequent
              colonization of rubble by coral larvae. There were no major

              proteins, the catenins. In the present study, we have detected
              the expression of $\alpha$-, $\beta$-, and $\gamma$-catenins in
              human osteoblasts, which assemble with cadherins to form two
              distinct complexes containing cadherin and $\alpha$-catenin, with

              primary mesenchyme cells into the blastocoel, after which they

              occurs in spaces enclosed by the cytoplasmic cables between the

              effect first reported by Roeet al.(Exp. Cell Res.181, 542--550,

              that fusion of primary mesenchyme cells still occurs in the
              presence of the inhibitor and the formation of the first calcite
              granule is not impeded. Continued elaboration of the spicule,
              however, is completely stopped; addition of the inhibitor during
              the active elongation of the spicule stops further elongation
              immediately. Removal of the inhibitor allows resumption of

              sensitive to the inhibitorin vitro,a protease of low abundance
              detectable in the medium of cultured primary mesenchyme cells is

  abstract = "BACKGROUND:Instructions to fabricate mineralized structures with
              distinct nanoscale architectures, such as seashells and coral and
              vertebrate skeletons, are encoded in the genomes of a wide
              variety of animals. In mollusks, the mantle is responsible for
              the extracellular production of the shell, directing the ordered
              biomineralization of CaCO3 and the deposition of architectural
              and color patterns. The evolutionary origins of the ability to
              synthesize calcified structures across various metazoan taxa
              remain obscure, with only a small number of protein families
              identified from molluskan shells. The recent sequencing of a wide
              range of metazoan genomes coupled with the analysis of gene
              expression in non-model animals has allowed us to investigate the
              evolution and process of biomineralization in gastropod
              mollusks.RESULTS:Here we show that over 25\% of the genes
              expressed in the mantle of the vetigastropod Haliotis asinina
              encode secreted proteins, indicating that hundreds of proteins
              are likely to be contributing to shell fabrication and
              patterning. Almost 85\% of the secretome encodes novel proteins;
              remarkably, only 19\% of these have identifiable homologues in
              the full genome of the patellogastropod Lottia scutum. The
              spatial expression profiles of mantle genes that belong to the
              secretome is restricted to discrete mantle zones, with each zone
              responsible for the fabrication of one of the structural layers
              of the shell. Patterned expression of a subset of genes along the
              length of the mantle is indicative of roles in shell
              ornamentation. For example, Has-sometsuke maps precisely to
              pigmentation patterns in the shell, providing the first case of a
              gene product to be involved in molluskan shell pigmentation. We
              also describe the expression of two novel genes involved in nacre
              (mother of pearl) deposition.CONCLUSION:The unexpected complexity
              and evolvability of this secretome and the modular design of the
              molluskan mantle enables diversification of shell strength and
              design, and as such must contribute to the variety of adaptive
              architectures and colors found in mollusk shells. The composition
              of this novel mantle-specific secretome suggests that there are
              significant molecular differences in the ways in which gastropods
              synthesize their shells.",

              ecosystem feedbacks can modulate changes in both average seawater
              chemistry and diel seawater chemistry variation. Here we model
              these effects for a coastal, reef flat ecosystem. We show that an
              increase in offshore pCO2 and temperature (to 900 µatm and + 3
              °C) can increase diel pH variation by as much as a factor of 2.5
              and can increase diel pCO2 variation by a factor of 4.6,
              depending on ecosystem feedbacks and seawater residence time.
              Importantly, these effects are different between day and night.
              With increasing seawater residence time and increasing feedback

              likely to cope with a warmer climate is by changing to more
              thermally tolerant endosymbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) genotypes.
              It is highly likely that hosting a more heat-tolerant algal
              genotype will be accompanied by tradeoffs in the physiology of
              the coral. To better understand one of these tradeoffs, growth
              was investigated in the Indo-Pacific reef-building coral Acropora
              millepora in both the laboratory and the field. In the Keppel
              Islands in the southern Great Barrier Reef this species naturally
              harbors nrDNA ITS1 thermally sensitive type C2 or thermally
              tolerant type D zooxanthellae of the genus Symbiodinium and can
              change dominant type following bleaching. We show that under
              controlled conditions, corals with type D symbionts grow 29\%
              slower than those with type C2 symbionts. In the field, type D
              colonies grew 38\% slower than C2 colonies. These results
              demonstrate the magnitude of trade-offs likely to be experienced
              by this species as they acclimatize to warmer conditions by
              changing to more thermally tolerant type D zooxanthellae.
              Irrespective of symbiont genotype, corals were affected to an
              even greater degree by the stress of a bleaching event which
              reduced growth by more than 50\% for up to 18 months compared to
              pre-bleaching rates. The processes of symbiont change and acute
              thermal stress are likely to act in concert on coral growth as
              reefs acclimatize to more stressful warmer conditions, further

              relating tissue-level physiological processes to gross corallum
              morphology",
  author   = "Jokiel, Paul L",
  abstract = "A comparison of the equations for photosynthesis and
              calcification in reef corals suggests that the two processes
              compete for available inorganic carbon; yet reef corals exhibit
              simultaneous high rates of photosynthesis and calcification
              during daylight hours. Also, the extreme metabolic activity
              observed in corals at high irradiance requires a large net efflux
              of protons at sites of rapid calcification and respiration.
              Corals have resolved these problems through development of
              morphologies that separate the zone of rapid calcification (ZC)
              from the zone of rapid photosynthesis (ZP), with the fixed-carbon
              energy supply from the ZP being rapidly translocated to the ZC.
              Translocation of photosynthate from the ZP serves as a means of
              transporting protons to the ZC, where they are readily dissipated
              into the water column. Observations on the spatial relationship
              of the ZC and ZP, analysis of net proton flux, incorporation of
              photosynthate translocation coupled with an understanding of the
              importance of boundary layers (BL) leads to a unified hypothesis
              that describes the processes involved in coral metabolism. The
              proposed model is based on the observation that reef corals have
              evolved a wide range of morphologies, but all of them place the
              ZC between the ZP and the external seawater. This spatial
              arrangement places the BL in contact with the ZC in order to
              facilitate efflux of protons out of the corallum. Placement of
              the ZC between the ZP and the BL maximizes recycling of the
              metabolic products O2 and HCO3−. Furthermore, this arrangement
              maximizes the photosynthetic efficiency of zooxanthellae by
              producing a canopy structure with the skeletal material in the ZC
              serving to absorb ultraviolet radiation (UVR) while scattering
              photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in a manner that
              maximizes absorption by the zooxanthellae. The ZP is isolated
              from the water column by the ZC and the BL. Therefore ZP must
              exchange metabolic materials with the ZC and with the water
              column through the ZC and its overlying BL. The resulting
              configuration is highly efficient and responsive to irradiance
              direction, irradiance intensity, water motion and coral polyp
              morphology. The skeletons of corals are thereby passively
              modified in response to physical factors such as light and water
              motion regime. The model presents a unified theory of coral
              metabolism and provides explanations for many paradoxes of coral
              biology, including plasticity of the diverse growth forms and an
              explanation for coral skeletal growth response to ocean

  abstract = "Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, the
              concentration of atmospheric CO2 has been rising due to the
              burning of fossil fuels. increased absorption of this CO2 by the
              oceans is lowering the seawater pH and aragonite saturation state
              ($\Omega$ar). This process is known as ocean acidification (OA).
              numerous studies have shown a direct correlation between
              declining ocean pH, declining $\Omega$ar, and declining coral
              growth, but the mechanism is not understood. Various experiments
              designed to evaluate the relative importance of pH, CO32-,
              $\Omega$ar, HCO3-, aqueous CO2, total alkalinity, and total
              inorganic carbon (Ct) to coral calcification have led to opposing
              conclusions. A reanalysis of existing data suggests that the
              mechanism is diffusion limitation of net H+ transport through the
              boundary layer caused by increasing [H+] in the water column. The

              the reduction in calcification caused by OA and other phenomena

              that the lowered calcification rate observed in corals under
              increasing conditions of OA can be attributed to higher [H+] in

              negative effects of CO2-driven ocean acidification (OA) on marine
              organisms. However, nearly all this work has focused on the
              effects of future conditions on modern populations, neglecting
              the role of adaptation. Rapid evolution can alter demographic
              responses to environmental change, ultimately affecting the
              likelihood of population persistence, but the capacity for
              adaptation will differ among populations and species. Here, we
              measure the capacity of the ecologically important purple sea
              urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus to adapt to OA, using a
              breeding experiment to estimate additive genetic variance for
              larval size (an important component of fitness) under future
              high-pCO2/low-pH conditions. Although larvae reared under future
              conditions were smaller than those reared under present-day
              conditions, we show that there is also abundant genetic variation
              for body size under elevated pCO2, indicating that this trait can
              evolve. The observed heritability of size was 0.40 $\pm$ 0.32
              (95\% CI) under low pCO2, and 0.50 $\pm$ 0.30 under high-pCO2
              conditions. Accounting for the observed genetic variation in
              models of future larval size and demographic rates substantially
              alters projections of performance for this species in the future
              ocean. Importantly, our model shows that after incorporating the
              effects of adaptation, the OA-driven decrease in population
              growth rate is up to 50\% smaller, than that predicted by the
              `no-adaptation' scenario. Adults used in the experiment were
              collected from two sites on the coast of the Northeast Pacific
              that are characterized by different pH regimes, as measured by
              autonomous sensors. Comparing results between sites, we also
              found subtle differences in larval size under high-pCO2 rearing
              conditions, consistent with local adaptation to carbonate
              chemistry in the field. These results suggest that spatially
              varying selection may help to maintain genetic variation

  abstract = "Fringing reefs are generally not simple veneers of coral growth
              along tropical shorelines. Extensive research over the past few
              decades, based on radiocarbon dating of Holocene reef deposits,
              has indicated that they can develop in a complex variety of ways
              even though the surface morphology may appear relatively simple.
              The principal factor that appears to determine the growth and
              morphology of fringing reefs is the available accommodation
              space. Sea-level fluctuations are important, primarily because
              the sea surface determines the absolute accommodation space for a
              given reef. This means that a reef established during a period of
              sea-level rise will be able to accrete vertically as space is
              created above it. If, however, the reef establishes at, or grows
              to, the sea surface, thereby occupying all the available
              accommodation space, it can no longer accrete vertically and
              begins to build laterally. The morphology and chronostratigraphy
              of a range of Holocene fringing reefs are described, on the basis
              of which six fringing reef growth models are identified. In model
              A, the fringing reef is established at depth and primarily
              accretes vertically towards the sea surface. Reef growth in model
              B initiates at sea level and due to the lack of vertical
              accommodation space grows laterally. Model C has a similar
              morphology to model B; however, the reef progrades over a
              non-reefal sediment wedge. Episodic lateral and vertical growth
              occurs in model D, with a stepwise progradation of the reef
              front. The remaining models are characterised by seaward reef
              framework behind which unconsolidated sediments accumulate. In
              model E, reef-crest growth forms a barrier leading to the
              development of a backreef lagoon. Model F has a similar
              morphology to model E, except that the reef crest is formed by
              hurricane rubble accumulation rather than framework accretion,
              and is periodically reworked.",

              has been documented throughout the Caribbean over the past
              150--200 years5, 6, and linked to variations in Atlantic sea

              drivers of changes in coral growth rates in the western Caribbean
              between 1880 and 2000, using previously published coral growth
              chronologies from two sites in the region, and a numerical model.
              Changes in coral growth rates over this period coincided with
              variations in sea surface temperature and incoming short-wave
              radiation. Our model simulations show that variations in the
              concentration of anthropogenic aerosols caused variations in sea
              surface temperature and incoming radiation in the second half of
              the twentieth century. Before this, variations in volcanic
              aerosols may have played a more important role. With the

              neither climate change from greenhouse-gas emissions nor ocean
              acidification is necessarily the driver of multi-decadal
              variations in growth rates at some Caribbean locations. Rather,

  abstract = "Estimated changes in reef area and CaCO3 production since the
              last glacial maximum (LGM) are presented for the first time,
              based on a model (ReefHab) which uses measured environmental data
              to predict global distribution of reef habitat. Suitable reef
              habitat is defined by temperature, salinity, nutrients, and the
              depth-attenuated level of photosynthetically available radiation
              (PAR). CaCO3 production is calculated as a function of PAR. When
              minimum PAR levels were chosen to restrict reef growth to 30 m
              depth and less, modern reef area totaled 584--746 $\times$ 10³
              km². Global carbonate production, which takes into account
              topographic relief as a control on carbonate accumulation, was
              1.00 Gt yr−1. These values are close to the most widely accepted
              estimates of reef area and carbonate production and demonstrate
              that basic environmental data can be used to define reef habitat
              and calcification. To simulate reef habitat changes since the
              LGM, the model was run at 1-kyr intervals, using appropriate sea
              level and temperature values. These runs show that at the LGM,
              reef area was restricted to 20\% of that today and carbonate
              production to 27\%, due primarily to a reduction in available
              space at the lower sea level and secondarily to lower sea surface
              temperatures. Nonetheless, these values suggest that reef growth
              prior to shelf flooding was more extensive than previously
              thought. A crude estimate of reef-released CO2 to the atmosphere
              since the LGM is of the same order of magnitude as the
              atmospheric CO2 change recorded in the Vostok ice core, which
              emphasizes the role of neritic carbonates within the global
              carbon cycle. This model currently addresses only the major
              physical and chemical controls on reef carbonate production, but
              it provides a template for estimating shallow tropical carbonate
              production both in the present and in the past. As such, the
              model highlights several long-standing issues regarding reef
              carbonates, particularly in terms of better defining the roles of

              full-length cDNA sequence encoding a novel matrix protein was
              cloned from the mantle of the bivalve oyster, Pinctada fucata.
              The deduced protein (Prisilkin-39), which has a molecular mass of

              characterized, and its role in biomineralization was demonstrated
              using both in vivo and in vitro crystal growth assays.
              Prisilkin-39 is a highly repetitive protein with an unusual
              composition of Gly, Tyr, and Ser residues. Expression of
              Prisilkin-39 was localized to columnar epithelial cells of the

              Prisilkin-39 binds tightly with chitin, an insoluble
              polysaccharide that forms the highly structured framework of the
              shell. Antibody injection in vivo resulted in dramatic

              calcification rates of the corals grown at the same temperature.
              We found that Sr/Ca was inversely related to calcification rate
              (Sr/Ca = 9.385 − 0.0040 (calcification rate)). Using a previously
              published calibration curve for this species, a 22 mg d−1
              colony−1increase in calcification rate introduced a 1°C warmer
              temperature estimate, with the 27 corals reporting
              ``temperatures'' ranging from 24.9 to 28.9°C, with mean 26.6
              $\pm$ 0.9°C standard deviation. Our results lend support to
              hypotheses invoking kinetic processes and growth rate to explain
              vital effects on Sr/Ca. However, uncertainty in the slope of the
              regression of Sr/Ca on calcification and a low R-squared value
              lead us to conclude that Sr/Ca could still be a useful proxy in
              this species given sufficient replication or by including growth
              rate in the calibration.",

              poorly understood. Dental enamel, the most highly mineralized
              tissue in mammals, differs from other calcifying systems in that
              the formative cells (ameloblasts) lack remodeling activity and
              largely degrade and resorb the initial extracellular matrix.
              Enamel mineralization requires that ameloblasts undergo a
              profound functional switch from matrix-secreting to maturational
              (calcium transport, protein resorption) roles as mineralization
              progresses. During the maturation stage, extracellular pH
              decreases markedly, placing high demands on ameloblasts to
              regulate acidic environments present around the growing
              hydroxyapatite crystals. To identify the genetic events driving
              enamel mineralization, we conducted genome-wide transcript
              profiling of the developing enamel organ from rat incisors and
              highlight over 300 genes differentially expressed during
              maturation. Using multiple bioinformatics analyses, we identified
              groups of maturation-associated genes whose functions are linked
              to key mineralization processes including pH regulation, calcium
              handling, and matrix turnover. Subsequent qPCR and Western blot

              novel protein Slc24a4 involved in calcium handling as well as

              a multicellular grade of organization in animals, one of the most
              dramatic transitions in evolution. Metazoan multicellularity is
              correlated with the evolution of embryogenesis, which presumably
              was underpinned by a gene regulatory network reliant on the
              differential activation of signaling pathways and transcription
              factors. Many transcription factor genes that play critical roles
              in bilaterian development largely appear to have evolved before
              the divergence of cnidarian and bilaterian lineages. In contrast,
              sponges seem to have a more limited suite of transcription
              factors, suggesting that the developmental regulatory gene
              repertoire changed markedly during early metazoan evolution.
              Using whole-genome information from the sponge Amphimedon
              queenslandica, a range of eumetazoans, and the choanoflagellate
              Monosiga brevicollis, we investigate the genesis and expansion of
              homeobox, Sox, T-box, and Fox transcription factor genes.
              Comparative analyses reveal that novel transcription factor
              domains (such as Paired, POU, and T-box) arose very early in
              metazoan evolution, prior to the separation of extant metazoan
              phyla but after the divergence of choanoflagellate and metazoan
              lineages. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that transcription
              factor classes then gradually expanded at the base of Metazoa
              before the bilaterian radiation, with each class following a
              different evolutionary trajectory. Based on the limited number of
              transcription factors in the Amphimedon genome, we infer that the
              genome of the metazoan last common ancestor included fewer gene
              members in each class than are present in extant eumetazoans.
              Transcription factor orthologues present in sponge, cnidarian,
              and bilaterian genomes may represent part of the core metazoan
              regulatory network underlying the origin of animal development

              anemone Aiptasia sp. and the scleractinian coral Oculina
              arbuscula. Prey DNA disappeared rapidly for the initial 1--3
              days, whereas complete digestion of prey DNA required up to 10
              days in O. arbuscula and 5 or 6 days in Aiptasia sp. depending on
              prey species. These digestion times are considerably longer than

              evolution of polarity will come from understanding the ontogeny
              of polarity in non-bilaterian forms, such as cnidarians. We
              examined how the axial properties of the starlet sea anemone,
              Nematostella vectensis (Anthozoa, Cnidaria), are established
              during embryogenesis. Egg-cutting experiments and sperm
              localization show that Nematostella eggs are only fertilized at
              the animal pole. Vital marking experiments demonstrate that the
              egg animal pole corresponds to the sites of first cleavage and
              gastrulation, and the oral pole of the adult. Embryo separation
              experiments demonstrate an asymmetric segregation of
              developmental potential along the animal--vegetal axis prior to
              the 8-cell stage. We demonstrate that Dishevelled (Dsh) plays an
              important role in mediating this asymmetric segregation of
              developmental fate. Although NvDsh mRNA is ubiquitously expressed
              during embryogenesis, the protein is associated with the female
              pronucleus at the animal pole in the unfertilized egg, becomes
              associated with the unipolar first cleavage furrow, and remains
              enriched in animal pole blastomeres. Our results suggest that at
              least one mechanism for Dsh enrichment at the animal pole is
              through its degradation at the vegetal pole. Functional studies
              reveal that NvDsh is required for specifying embryonic polarity
              and endoderm by stabilizing $\beta$-catenin in the canonical Wnt

              Nematostella and two other anthozoan cnidarians (scleractinian
              corals) provides a possible explanation for how the site of
              gastrulation has changed in bilaterian evolution while other
              axial components of development have remained the same and

              underlying physiological and biogeochemical trait(s) that are
              responsible for mounding coral holobiont resilience to bleaching.
              Furthermore, the potential of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as a
              source of fixed carbon to bleached corals has never been
              determined. Here, Porites lobata corals were experimentally
              bleached for 23 days and then allowed to recover for 0, 1, 5, and
              11 months. At each recovery interval a suite of analyses were
              performed to assess their recovery (photosynthesis, respiration,
              chlorophyll a, energy reserves, tissue biomass, calcification,
              $\delta$13C of the skeletal, $\delta$13C, and $\delta$15N of the
              animal host and endosymbiont fractions). Furthermore, at 0 months
              of recovery, the assimilation of photosynthetically acquired and
              zooplankton-feeding acquired carbon into the animal host,
              endosymbiont, skeleton, and coral-mediated DOC were measured via
              13C-pulse-chase labeling. During the first month of recovery,
              energy reserves and tissue biomass in bleached corals were
              maintained despite reductions in chlorophyll a, photosynthesis,
              and the assimilation of photosynthetically fixed carbon. At the
              same time, P. lobata corals catabolized carbon acquired from
              zooplankton and seemed to take up DOC as a source of fixed
              carbon. All variables that were negatively affected by bleaching
              recovered within 5 to 11 months. Thus, bleaching resilience in
              the mounding coral P. lobata is driven by its ability to actively
              catabolize zooplankton-acquired carbon and seemingly utilize DOC
              as a significant fixed carbon source, facilitating the
              maintenance of energy reserves and tissue biomass. With the
              frequency and intensity of bleaching events expected to increase

              the coral host responds to pathogen infection is an area where
              very little is known. Here we used next-generation RNA-sequencing
              (RNA-seq) to produce a transcriptome-wide profile of the immune
              response of the Staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis to White Band

              coral tissues, and parsed bioinformatically into coral and
              non-coral transcripts using existing Acropora genomes in order to
              identify putative coral transcripts. Differentially expressed
              transcripts were identified in the coral and non-coral datasets
              to identify genes that were up- and down-regulated due to disease
              infection. RNA-seq analyses indicate that infected corals
              exhibited significant changes in gene expression across 4\%
              (1,805 out of 47,748 transcripts) of the coral transcriptome. The
              primary response to infection included transcripts involved in
              macrophage-mediated pathogen recognition and ROS production, two
              hallmarks of phagocytosis, as well as key mediators of apoptosis
              and calcium homeostasis. The strong up-regulation of the enzyme
              allene oxide synthase-lipoxygenase suggests a key role of the

              (TLR), Complement, and prophenoloxydase pathways, were strongly

              Five-hundred and fifty differentially expressed non-coral

              most metazoan phyla and often have supportive, protective, or
              feeding functions. Among deuterostomes, only echinoderms and
              vertebrates produce extensive biomineralized structures. Although

              biomineralization. The present study had two goals. First, we
              sought to expand our understanding of the proteins involved in
              biomineralization in the sea urchin, a powerful model system for
              analyzing the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms that
              underlie this process. Second, we sought to shed light on the
              possible evolutionary relationships between biomineralization in
              echinoderms and vertebrates. We used several computational
              methods to survey the genome of the purple sea urchin
              Strongylocentrotus purpuratus for gene products involved in
              biomineralization. Our analysis has greatly expanded the
              collection of biomineralization-related proteins. We have found
              that these proteins are often members of small families encoded
              by genes that are clustered in the genome. Most of the proteins
              are sea urchin-specific; that is, they have no apparent
              homologues in other invertebrate deuterostomes or vertebrates.
              Similarly, many of the vertebrate proteins that mediate mineral
              deposition do not have counterparts in the S. purpuratus genome.
              Our findings therefore reveal substantial differences in the
              primary sequences of proteins that mediate biomineral formation
              in echinoderms and vertebrates, possibly reflecting loose
              constraints on the primary structures of the proteins involved.
              On the other hand, certain cellular and molecular processes
              associated with earlier events in skeletogenesis appear similar
              in echinoderms and vertebrates, leaving open the possibility of

              However, the question of how mollusks control the morphology of
              nacre lamellae remains unresolved. Here, a novel 38-kDa
              extrapallial fluid (EPF) protein, named amorphous calcium

              involved in the shell mineralization process. In vitro, ACCBP can
              inhibit the growth of calcite and induce the formation of
              amorphous calcium carbonate. When ACCBP functions were restrained
              in vivo, the nacre lamellae grew in a screw-dislocation pattern,
              and low crystallinity CaCO3 precipitated from the EPF. Crystal
              binding experiments further revealed that ACCBP could recognize

              governed by Mendelian patterns of inheritance, the common grove
              snail, Cepaea nemoralis, has served as a model for evolutionary
              biologists and population geneticists for decades. Surprisingly,
              the molecular mechanisms by which C. nemoralis generates this
              pigmented shelled diversity, and the degree of evolutionary
              conservation present between molluscan shell-forming proteomes,
              remain unknown.RESULTS:Here, using next generation sequencing and
              high throughput proteomics, we identify and characterize the
              major proteinaceous components of the C. nemoralis shell, the
              first shell-proteome for a pulmonate mollusc. The recent
              availability of several marine molluscan shell-proteomes, and the
              dataset we report here, allow us to identify 59 evolutionarily
              conserved and novel shell-forming proteins. While the C.
              nemoralis dataset is dominated by proteins that share little to
              no similarity with proteins in public databases, almost half of
              it shares similarity with proteins present in other molluscan
              shells. In addition, we could not find any indication that a
              protein (or class of proteins) is directly associated with shell
              pigmentation in C. nemoralis. This is in contrast to the only
              other partially characterized molluscan-shell pigmentation
              mechanism employed by the tropical abalone Haliotis
              asinina.CONCLUSIONS:The unique pulmonate shell-forming proteome
              that we report here reveals an abundance of both mollusc-specific
              and pulmonate-specific proteins, suggesting that novel coding
              sequences, and/or the extensive divergence of these sequences
              from ancestral sequences, supported the innovation of new shell
              types within the Conchifera. In addition, we report here the
              first evidence that molluscs use independently evolved mechanisms
              to pigment their shells. This proteome provides a solid
              foundation from which further studies aimed at the functional

  abstract = "BACKGROUND:The organic matrix of biominerals plays an important
              role in biomineral formation and in determining biomineral
              properties. However, most components of biomineral matrices
              remain unknown at present. In sea urchin, which is an important
              model organism for developmental biology and biomineralization,
              only few matrix components have been identified and characterized
              at the protein level. The recent publication of the
              Strongylocentrotus purpuratus genome sequence rendered possible
              not only the identification of possible matrix proteins at the
              gene level, but also the direct identification of proteins
              contained in matrices of skeletal elements by in-depth,
              high-accuracy, proteomic analysis.RESULTS:We identified 110
              proteins as components of sea urchin test and spine organic
              matrix. Fourty of these proteins occurred in both compartments
              while others were unique to their respective compartment. More
              than 95\% of the proteins were detected in sea urchin skeletal
              matrices for the first time. The most abundant protein in both
              matrices was the previously characterized spicule matrix protein
              SM50, but at least eight other members of this group, many of
              them only known as conceptual translation products previously,
              were identified by mass spectrometric sequence analysis of
              peptides derived from in vitro matrix degradation. The matrices
              also contained proteins implicated in biomineralization processes
              previously by inhibition studies using antibodies or specific
              enzyme inhibitors, such as matrix metalloproteases and members of
              the mesenchyme-specific MSP130 family. Other components were
              carbonic anhydrase, collagens, echinonectin, a
              alpha2-macroglobulin-like protein and several proteins containing
              scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains. A few possible signal
              transduction pathway components, such as GTP-binding proteins, a
              semaphorin and a possible tyrosine kinase were also
              identified.CONCLUSION:This report presents the most comprehensive
              list of sea urchin skeletal matrix proteins available at present.
              The complex mixture of proteins identified in matrices of the sea
              urchin skeleton may reflect many different aspects of the

              measures peptides our results validate many predicted genes and
              confirm the existence of the corresponding proteins. Considering
              the many newly identified matrix proteins, this proteomic study
              may serve as a road map for the further exploration of

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The sea urchin embryo has been an important model
              organism in developmental biology for more than a century. This
              is due to its relatively simple construction, translucent
              appearance, and the possibility to follow the fate of individual
              cells as development to the pluteus larva proceeds. Because the
              larvae contain tiny calcitic skeletal elements, the spicules,
              they are also important model organisms for biomineralization
              research. Similar to other biominerals the spicule contains an
              organic matrix, which is thought to play an important role in its
              formation. However, only few spicule matrix proteins were
              identified previously. RESULTS: Using mass spectrometry-based
              methods we have identified 231 proteins in the matrix of the S.
              purpuratus spicule matrix. Approximately two thirds of the
              identified proteins are either known or predicted to be
              extracellular proteins or transmembrane proteins with large
              ectodomains. The ectodomains may have been solubilized by partial
              proteolysis and subsequently integrated into the growing spicule.
              The most abundant protein of the spicule matrix is SM50.
              SM50-related proteins, SM30-related proteins, MSP130 and related
              proteins, matrix metalloproteases and carbonic anhydrase are
              among the most abundant components. CONCLUSIONS: The spicule
              matrix is a relatively complex mixture of proteins not only
              containing matrix-specific proteins with a function in matrix
              assembly or mineralization, but also: 1) proteins possibly
              important for the formation of the continuous membrane
              delineating the mineralization space; 2) proteins for secretory
              processes delivering proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous
              precursors; 3) or proteins reflecting signaling events at the
              cell/matrix interface. Comparison of the proteomes of different
              skeletal matrices allows prediction of proteins of general
              importance for mineralization in sea urchins, such as SM50,
              SM30-E, SM29 or MSP130. The comparisons also help point out
              putative tissue-specific proteins, such as tooth phosphodontin or
              specific spicule matrix metalloproteases of the MMP18/19 group.
              Furthermore, the direct sequence analysis of peptides by MS/MS
              validates many predicted genes and confirms the existence of the
              corresponding proteins.",

  abstract = "Ocean acidification (OA) is expected to reduce the calcification
              rates of marine organisms, yet we have little understanding of
              how OA will manifest within dynamic, real-world systems. Natural
              CO2, alkalinity, and salinity gradients can significantly alter
              local carbonate chemistry, and thereby create a range of
              susceptibility for different ecosystems to OA. As such, there is
              a need to characterize this natural variability of seawater
              carbonate chemistry, especially within coastal ecosystems. Since
              2009, carbonate chemistry data have been collected on the Florida
              Reef Tract (FRT). During periods of heightened productivity,
              there is a net uptake of total CO2 (TCO2) which increases
              aragonite saturation state (Ωarag) values on inshore patch reefs
              of the upper FRT. These waters can exhibit greater Ωarag than
              what has been modeled for the tropical surface ocean during
              preindustrial times, with mean ($\pm$ std. error) Ωarag-values in
              spring = 4.69 ($\pm$0.101). Conversely, Ωarag-values on offshore
              reefs generally represent oceanic carbonate chemistries
              consistent with present day tropical surface ocean conditions.
              This gradient is opposite from what has been reported for other
              reef environments. We hypothesize this pattern is caused by the
              photosynthetic uptake of TCO2 mainly by seagrasses and, to a
              lesser extent, macroalgae in the inshore waters of the FRT. These
              inshore reef habitats are therefore potential acidification
              refugia that are defined not only in a spatial sense, but also in
              time; coinciding with seasonal productivity dynamics. Coral reefs
              located within or immediately downstream of seagrass beds may
              find refuge from OA.",

              number of remarkable properties, such as calcium-binding

              nacre-soluble matrix exhibits a carbonic anhydrase activity, an
              important function in calcification processes. This matrix is
              composed of three main proteinaceous discrete fractions. The one

              uncharacterised.RESULTS:Recent expressed sequence tag (EST)
              investigations of the mantle tissue from the tropical abalone
              (Haliotis asinina) provide an opportunity to further characterise
              the proteins in the shell by a proteomic approach. In this study,
              we have identified a total of 14 proteins from distinct calcified
              layers of the shell. Only two of these proteins have been
              previously characterised from abalone shells. Among the novel
              proteins are several glutamine- and methionine-rich motifs and
              hydrophobic glycine-, alanine- and acidic aspartate-rich domains.
              In addition, two of the new proteins contained Kunitz-like and
              WAP (whey acidic protein) protease inhibitor
              domains.CONCLUSION:This is one of the first comprehensive
              proteomic study of a molluscan shell, and should provide a
              platform for further characterization of matrix protein functions
              and interactions.",

              determined. Both proteins are soluble, intracrystalline, and
              acidic. The 38-kDa protein is glycosylated; the 17-kDa one is
              not. Ala, Asx, Thr, and Pro represent the dominant residues of
              the 38-kDa protein, named calprismin. An N-terminal sequence was
              obtained from calprismin. This sequence, which comprises a
              pattern of 4 cysteine residues, is not related to any known
              protein. The second protein, named caspartin, exhibits an unusual
              amino acid composition, since Asx constitutes by far the main
              amino acid residue. Preliminary sequencing surprisingly suggests
              that the first 75 N-terminal residues are all Asp. Caspartin
              self-aggregates spontaneously into multimers. In vitro tests show
              that it inhibits the precipitation of calcium carbonate.
              Furthermore, it strongly interferes with the growth of calcite
              crystals. A polyclonal antiserum raised against caspartin was
              used to localize this protein in the shell by immunogold. The
              immunolocalization demonstrates that caspartin is distributed
              within the prisms and makes a continuous film at the interface

              regulated but poorly understood process by which organisms
              precipitate minerals from a wide variety of elements [1]. For
              many years, it has been hypothesized that the biological
              precipitation of carbonates is catalyzed by and organized on an
              extracellular organic matrix containing a suite of proteins,
              lipids, and polysaccharides [2, 3]. The structures of these
              molecules, their evolutionary history, and the biophysical
              mechanisms responsible for calcification remain enigmatic.
              Despite the recognition that mineralized tissues contain proteins
              that are unusually rich in aspartic and glutamic acids [4--6],
              the role of these proteins in biomineralization remains elusive
              [5, 6]. Here we report, for the first time, the identification,
              cloning, amino acid sequence, and characterization of four highly
              acidic proteins, derived from expression of genes obtained from
              the common stony coral, Stylophora pistillata. Each of these four
              proteins can spontaneously catalyze the precipitation of calcium
              carbonate in vitro. Our results demonstrate that coral acid-rich
              proteins (CARPs) not only bind Ca2+ stoichiometrically but also
              precipitate aragonite in vitro in seawater at pH 8.2 and 7.6, via
              an electrostatic interaction with protons on bicarbonate anions.
              Phylogenetic analysis suggests that at least one of the CARPs
              arose from a gene fusion. Similar, highly acidic proteins appear
              to have evolved several times independently in metazoans through
              convergence. Based purely on thermodynamic grounds, the predicted
              change in surface ocean pH in the next decades would appear to
              have minimal effect on the capacity of these acid-rich proteins
              to precipitate carbonates.",

              Viable cell cultures of the hermatypic, zooxanthellate coral,
              Stylophora pistillata, have been maintained for 6 to 8 weeks.
              Using an enriched seawater medium with aragonite saturation state
              similar to open ocean surface waters ($\Omega$arag∼4), the
              primary cell cultures assemble into ``proto-polyps'' which form
              an extracellular organic matrix (ECM) and precipitate aragonite
              crystals. These extracellular aragonite crystals, about 10 µm in
              length, are formed on the external face of the proto-polyps and
              are identified by their distinctive elongated crystallography and

  abstract = "At fourth cleavage of sea urchin embryos four micromeres at the
              vegetal pole separate from four macromeres just above them in an
              unequal cleavage. The micromeres have the capacity to induce a
              second axis if transplanted to the animal pole and the absence of
              micromeres at the vegetal pole results in the failure of
              macromere progeny to specify secondary mesenchyme cells (SMCs).
              This suggests that micromeres have the capacity to induce SMCs.
              We demonstrate that micromeres require nuclear beta-catenin to
              exhibit SMC induction activity. Transplantation studies show that
              much of the vegetal hemisphere is competent to receive the
              induction signal. The micromeres induce SMCs, most likely through
              direct contact with macromere progeny, or at most a cell diameter
              away. The induction is quantitative in that more SMCs are induced
              by four micromeres than by one. Temporal studies show that the
              induction signal is passed from the micromeres to macromere
              progeny between the eighth and tenth cleavage. If micromeres are
              removed from hosts at the fourth cleavage, SMC induction in hosts
              is rescued if they later receive transplanted micromeres between
              the eighth and tenth cleavage. After the tenth cleavage addition
              of induction-competent micromeres to micromereless embryos fails
              to specify SMCs. For macromere progeny to be competent to receive
              the micromere induction signal, beta-catenin must enter macromere
              nuclei. The macromere progeny receive the micromere induction
              signal through the Notch receptor. Signaling-competent micromeres
              fail to induce SMCs if macromeres express dominant-negative
              Notch. Expression of an activated Notch construct in macromeres
              rescues SMC specification in the absence of induction-competent
              micromeres. These data are consistent with a model whereby
              beta-catenin enters the nuclei of micromeres and, as a
              consequence, the micromeres produce an inductive ligand. Between
              the eighth and tenth cleavage micromeres induce SMCs through
              Notch. In order to be receptive to the micromere inductive signal
              the macromeres first must transport beta-catenin to their nuclei,
              and as one consequence the Notch pathway becomes competent to
              receive the micromere induction signal, and to transduce that
              signal. As Notch is maternally expressed in macromeres,
              additional components must be downstream of nuclear beta-catenin
              in macromeres for these cells to receive and transduce the
              micromere induction signal.",

              proteins, we have characterized two proteins isolated from the
              aragonitic component of nacre of the red abalone, Haliotis
              rufescens. These proteins, purified by hydrophobic interaction
              chromatography, are designated AP7 and AP24 (aragonitic protein
              of molecular weight 7 kDa and 24 kDa, respectively). Degenerate
              oligonucleotide primers corresponding to N-terminal and internal
              peptide sequences were used to amplify cDNA clones by a

              primary amino acid sequences are presented. Preliminary crystal
              growth experiments demonstrate that protein fractions enriched in
              AP7 and AP24 produced CaCO3 crystals with morphology distinct
              from crystals grown in the presence of the total mixture of
              soluble aragonite-specific proteins. Peptides corresponding to
              the first 30 residues of the N-terminal sequences of both AP7 and
              AP24 were generated. The synthetic peptides frustrate the
              progression of step edges of a growing calcite surface,
              indicating that sequence features within the N-termini of AP7 and
              AP24 include domains that interact with CaCO3. CD analyses
              demonstrate that the N-terminal peptide sequences do not possess
              significant percentages of $\alpha$-helix or $\beta$-strand
              secondary structure in solution. Instead, in both the presence
              and absence of Ca(II), the peptides retain unfolded conformations

              of the carbonate sediment accumulates on reefs, banks, and
              tropical shelves, and consists largely of metastable aragonite
              and magnesian calcite. Deep-sea carbonates, predominantly
              calcitic coccoliths and planktonic foraminifera, have orders of
              magnitude lower productivity and accumulation rates than
              shallow-water carbonates, but they cover orders of magnitude
              larger basin area. Twice as much calcium is removed from the
              oceans by present-day carbonate accumulation as is estimated to
              be brought in by rivers and hydrothermal activity (1.6 bt),

              level, while groundwater influx increases because of heightened

              chitin synthase-like proteins, two N16 proteins (pearlins), 10
              N19 proteins, two nacreins, four Pifs, nine shematrins, two
              prismalin-14 proteins, and 21 tyrosinases. This diversity of
              shell matrix proteins may be implicated in the morphological
              diversity of mollusc shells. The annotated genes reported here
              can be searched in P. fucata gene models version 1.1 and genome
              assembly version 1.0

              we have carried out purification, characterization, and cDNA

              the nacreous layer of oyster pearls. Northern blot analysis

              crucial to our understanding of modern mineralized tissues.
              Traditional methods of unravelling this history have aimed to
              derive a theory of the development of biomineralization through
              evolution by the comparison of mineralized systems in model
              organisms. This has led to the recognition of the
              `biomineralization toolkit' and raised the question of the
              homology of mineralized tissues versus convergent or parallel
              evolution. The `new animal phylogeny' reveals that many of the
              groups known to biomineralize sit among close relatives that do
              not, and it favours an interpretation of convergent or parallel
              evolution for biomineralization in animals. In addition, the
              fossil record of the earliest mineralized skeletons presents a
              rapid proliferation of biomineralization across a range of animal
              phyla with fossil representatives of many modern biomineralizing
              phyla. A synthesis of molecular, developmental, phylogenetic and
              fossil evidence demonstrates the convergent or parallel evolution
              of biomineralization in animals at the phylum level. The fossil
              record of the Cambrian explosion not only provides vital evidence

              spicules and of the comitalia and highlight their organic matrix
              in order to understand their mechanical properties. The spicules
              display three distinct regions built of biosilica: (i) the outer
              lamellar zone (radius: >300 $\mu$m), (ii) the bulky axial
              cylinder (radius: <75 $\mu$m), and (iii) the central axial canal
              (diameter: <2 $\mu$m) with its organic axial filament. The
              spicules are loosely covered with a collagen net which is
              regularly perforated by 7--10 $\mu$m large holes; the net can be
              silicified. The silica layers forming the lamellar zone are
              $\approx$5 $\mu$m thick; the central axial cylinder appears to be
              composed of almost solid silica which becomes porous after
              etching with hydrofluoric acid (HF). Dissolution of a complete
              spicule discloses its complex structure with distinct lamellae in
              the outer zone (lamellar coating) and a more resistant central
              part (axial barrel). Rapidly after the release of the organic
              coating from the lamellar zone the protein layers disintegrate to
              form irregular clumps/aggregates. In contrast, the proteinaceous
              axial barrel, hidden in the siliceous axial cylinder, is set up
              by rope-like filaments. Biochemical analysis revealed that the
              (dominant) molecule of the lamellar coating is a 27-kDa protein
              which displays catalytic, proteolytic activity. High resolution
              electron microscopic analysis showed that this protein is
              arranged within the lamellae and stabilizes these surfaces by
              palisade-like pillars. The mechanical behavior of the spicules
              was analyzed by a 3-point bending assay, coupled with scanning
              electron microscopy. The load-extension curve of the spicule
              shows a biphasic breakage/cracking pattern. The outer lamellar
              zone cracks in several distinct steps showing high resistance in
              concert with comparably low elasticity, while the axial cylinder
              breaks with high elasticity and lower stiffness. The complex

              the calicoblastic ectoderm level, which is responsible for the
              precipitation of the skeleton. This localization supports the

  abstract = "Carbonate-rich sediments at shoal to shelf depths (<200 m)
              represent a major CaCO[3] reservoir that can rapidly react to the
              decreasing saturation state of seawater with respect to carbonate
              minerals, produced by the increasing partial pressure of
              atmospheric carbon dioxide (pCO[2]) and ``acidification'' of
              ocean waters. Aragonite is usually the most abundant carbonate
              mineral in these sediments. However, the second most abundant
              (typically ∼24 wt\%) carbonate mineral is high Mg-calcite
              (Mg-calcite) whose solubility can exceed that of aragonite making
              it the ``first responder'' to the decreasing saturation state of
              seawater. For the naturally occurring biogenic Mg-calcites,
              dissolution experiments have been used to predict their
              ``stoichiometric solubilities'' as a function of mol\% MgCO[3].
              The only valid relationship that one can provisionally use for
              the metastable stabilities for Mg-calcite based on composition is
              that for the synthetically produced phases where metastable
              equilibrium has been achieved from both under- and
              over-saturation. Biogenic Mg-calcites exhibit a large offset in
              solubility from that of abiotic Mg-calcite and can also exhibit a
              wide range of solubilities for biogenic Mg-calcites of similar Mg
              content. This indicates that factors other than the Mg content
              can influence the solubility of these mineral phases. Thus, it is
              necessary to turn to observations of natural sediments where
              changes in the saturation state of surrounding waters occur in
              order to determine their likely responses to the changing
              saturation state in upper oceanic waters brought on by increasing
              pCO[2]. In the present study, we investigate the responses of
              Mg-calcites to rising pCO[2] and ``ocean acidification'' by means
              of a simple numerical model based on the experimental range of
              biogenic Mg-calcite solubilities as a function of Mg content in
              order to bracket the behavior of the most abundant Mg-calcite
              phases in the natural environment. In addition, observational
              data from Bermuda and the Great Bahama Bank are also presented in
              order to project future responses of these minerals. The
              numerical simulations suggest that Mg-calcite minerals will
              respond to rising pCO[2] by sequential dissolution according to
              mineral stability, progressively leading to removal of the more
              soluble phases until the least soluble phases remain. These
              results are confirmed by laboratory experiments and observations
              from Bermuda. As a consequence of continuous increases in
              atmospheric CO[2] from burning of fossil fuels, the average
              composition of contemporary carbonate sediments could change,
              i.e., the average Mg content in the sediments may slowly
              decrease. Furthermore, evidence from the Great Bahama Bank
              indicates that the amount of abiotic carbonate production is
              likely to decline as pCO[2] continues to rise.",

              By performing a partial-equilibrium analysis, we estimate global
              and regional economic costs of production loss of mollusks due to
              ocean acidification. Our results show that the costs for the
              world as a whole could be over 100 billion USD with an assumption
              of increasing demand of mollusks with expected income growths
              combined with a business-as-usual emission trend towards the year
              2100. The major determinants of cost levels are the impacts on
              the Chinese production, which is dominant in the world, and the
              expected demand increase of mollusks in today's developing
              countries, which include China, in accordance with their future
              income rise. Our results have direct implications for climate
              policy. Because the ocean acidifies faster than the atmosphere
              warms, the acidification effects on mollusks would raise the
              social cost of carbon more strongly than the estimated damage
              adds to the damage costs of climate change.",

  title    = "Do fluctuating temperature environments elevate coral thermal
              tolerance?",
  author   = "Oliver, T A and Palumbi, S R",
  abstract = "In reef corals, much research has focused on the capacity of
              corals to acclimatize and/or adapt to different thermal
              environments, but the majority of work has focused on
              distinctions in mean temperature. Across small spatial scales,
              distinctions in daily temperature variation are common, but the
              role of such environmental variation in setting coral thermal
              tolerances has received little attention. Here, we take advantage
              of back-reef pools in American Samoa that differ in thermal
              variation to investigate the effects of thermally fluctuating
              environments on coral thermal tolerance. We experimentally
              heat-stressed Acropora hyacinthus from a thermally moderate
              lagoon pool (temp range 26.5--33.3°C) and from a more thermally
              variable pool that naturally experiences 2--3 h high temperature
              events during summer low tides (temp range 25.0--35°C). We
              compared mortality and photosystem II photochemical efficiency of
              colony fragments exposed to ambient temperatures (median: 28.0°C)
              or elevated temperatures (median: 31.5°C). In the heated
              treatment, moderate pool corals showed nearly 50\% mortality
              whether they hosted heat-sensitive (49.2 $\pm$ 6.5\% SE; C2) or
              heat-resistant (47.0 $\pm$ 11.2\% SE; D) symbionts. However,
              variable pool corals, all of which hosted heat-resistant
              symbionts, survived well, showing low mortalities (16.6 $\pm$
              8.8\% SE) statistically indistinguishable from controls held at
              ambient temperatures (5.1--8.3 $\pm$ 3.3--8.3\% SE). Similarly,
              moderate pool corals hosting heat-sensitive algae showed rapid
              rates of decline in algal photosystem II photochemical efficiency
              in the elevated temperature treatment (slope = −0.04 day−1 $\pm$
              0.007 SE); moderate pool corals hosting heat-resistant algae
              showed intermediate levels of decline (slope = −0.039 day−1 $\pm$
              0.007 SE); and variable pool corals hosting heat-resistant algae
              showed the least decline (slope = −0.028 day−1 $\pm$ 0.004 SE).
              High gene flow among pools suggests that these differences
              probably reflect coral acclimatization not local genetic
              adaptation. Our results suggest that previous exposure to an
              environmentally variable microhabitat adds substantially to
              coral--algal thermal tolerance, beyond that provided by
              heat-resistant symbionts alone.",

              isolation, and the biological ECM system or ``adhesome'' also
              depends on posttranslational processing enzymes, cell surface
              receptors, and extracellular proteases. We focus principally on
              the adhesome of internal tissues and discuss its origins at the
              dawn of the metazoa and the expansion of complexity that occurred
              in the chordate lineage. The analyses demonstrate very high
              conservation of a core adhesome that apparently evolved in a
              major wave of innovation in conjunction with the origin of
              metazoa. Integrin, CD36, and certain domains predate the metazoa,
              and some ECM-related proteins are identified in choanoflagellates

              complemented by published data from belemnites and planktonic

              isotope composition of seawater ($\delta$44/40CaSW) over the
              Phanerozoic. The compiled $\delta$44/40CaSW record shows a
              general increase from ∼1.3‰ (NIST SRM 915a) at the beginning of
              the Ordovician to ∼2‰ at present. Superimposed on this trend is a
              major long-term positive excursion from the Early Carboniferous
              to Early Permian as well as several short-term, mostly negative,
              oscillations. A numerical model of the global cycles of calcium,
              carbon, magnesium and strontium was used to estimate whether the
              recorded $\delta$44/40CaSW variations can be explained by varying
              magnitudes of input and output fluxes of calcium to the oceans.
              The model uses the record of marine 87Sr/86Sr ratios as proxy for
              seafloor spreading rates, a record of oceanic Mg/Ca ratios to
              estimate rates of dolomite formation, and reconstructed
              atmospheric CO2, discharge and erosion rates to estimate
              continental weathering fluxes. The model results indicate that
              varying magnitudes of the calcium input and output fluxes cannot
              explain the observed $\delta$44/40CaSW trends, suggesting that
              the isotope signatures of these fluxes must also have changed. As
              a possible mechanism we suggest variable isotope fractionation in
              the sedimentary output flux controlled by the dominant mineralogy
              in marine carbonate deposits, i.e. the oscillating
              `calcite--aragonite seas'. The ultimate control of the calcium
              isotope budget of the Phanerozoic oceans appears to have been
              tectonic processes, specifically variable rates of oceanic crust
              production that modulated the hydrothermal calcium flux and the
              oceanic Mg/Ca ratio, which in turn controlled the dominant
              mineralogy of marine carbonates, hence the $\delta$44/40CaSW. As
              to the causes of the short-term oscillations recorded in the
              secular $\delta$44/40CaSW trend, we tentatively propose that
              these are related to variable rates of dolomite formation and/or
              to changing chemical composition of the riverine flux, in
              particular Ca / HCO 3 - and Ca / SO 4 2 - ratios, induced by

              to be about 5 billion tons (bt) per year, of which about 3 bt
              accumulate in sediments; the other 40\% is dissolved. Nearly half
              of the carbonate sediment accumulates on reefs, banks, and
              tropical shelves, and consists largely of metastable aragonite
              and magnesian calcite. Deep-sea carbonates, predominantly
              calcitic coccoliths and planktonic foraminifera, have orders of
              magnitude lower productivity and accumulation rates than
              shallow-water carbonates, but they cover orders of magnitude
              larger basin area. Twice as much calcium is removed from the
              oceans by present-day carbonate accumulation as is estimated to
              be brought in by rivers and hydrothermal activity (1.6 bt),

              presumably is offset by decreased accumulation and increased
              input during lowered sea level: shallow-water accumulation
              decreases by an order of magnitude with a 100 m drop in sea
              level, while groundwater influx increases because of heightened

              enhance their survival. In this study, after 3-d and 7-d exposure
              to three different pH levels (8.0, 7.6, and 7.3), we found that
              the oxygen consumption of Acropora digitifera larvae tended to be
              suppressed with reduced pH, although a statistically significant

              progressively from two years old, which represents a limitation
              for broodstock conditioning for aquaculture production. In marine
              mollusks displaying hermaphroditic features, data on sexual
              determinism and differentiation, including the molecular sex
              determining cascade, are scarce. To increase genomic resources
              and identify the molecular mechanisms whereby gene expression may
              act in the sexual dimorphism of P. margaritifera, we performed
              gonad transcriptome analysis.RESULTS:The gonad transcriptome of
              P. margaritifera was sequenced from several gonadic samples of
              males and females at different development stages, using a
              Next-Generation-Sequencing method and RNAseq technology. After
              Illumina sequencing, assembly and annotation, we obtained 70,147
              contigs of which 62.2\% shared homologies with existing protein
              sequences, and 9\% showed functional annotation with Gene

              differentially expressed contigs between the different categories
              of gonads. Clustering methods of samples revealed that the sex
              explained most of the variation in gonad gene expression. K-means
              clustering of differentially expressed contigs showed 815 and 574
              contigs were more expressed in male and female gonads,
              respectively. The analysis of these contigs revealed the presence

              determinism and/or differentiation, such as dmrt and fem-1 like

              reared under a total of six conditions for 3.5 weeks,
              representing three pCO2 levels (382, 607, 741 µatm), and two
              temperature regimes (26.5, 29.0°C) within each pCO2 level. After
              one month under experimental conditions, only A. millepora
              decreased calcification (−53\%) in response to seawater pCO2
              expected by the end of this century, whereas the other three
              species maintained calcification rates even when both pCO2 and
              temperature were elevated. Coral energy reserves showed mixed
              responses to elevated pCO2 and temperature, and were either
              unaffected or displayed nonlinear responses with both the lowest
              and highest concentrations often observed at the mid-pCO2 level
              of 607 µatm. Biweekly feeding may have helped corals maintain
              calcification rates and energy reserves under these conditions.
              Temperature often modulated the response of many aspects of coral
              physiology to OA, and both mitigated and worsened pCO2 effects.
              This demonstrates for the first time that coral energy reserves
              are generally not metabolized to sustain calcification under OA,
              which has important implications for coral health and bleaching
              resilience in a high-CO2 world. Overall, these findings suggest
              that some corals could be more resistant to simultaneously
              warming and acidifying oceans than previously expected.",

              precipitation of aragonite in the absence of magnesium ions,

              In artificial seawater, where magnesium ions were present, this

              material and yielding a long-term precision better than 0.2‰
              (1$\sigma$). Using this new method, we investigate CS-$\delta$15N
              at Bermuda. Ten modern Diploria labyrinthiformis coral
              cores/colonies from 4 sampling sites were measured for
              CS-$\delta$15N. Nitrogen concentrations (nitrate + nitrite,
              ammonium, and dissolved organic nitrogen) and $\delta$15N of
              plankton were also measured at these coral sites. Among the 4
              sampling sites, CS-$\delta$15N shows an increase with proximity
              to the island, from ∼3.8‰ to ∼6.8‰ vs. atmospheric N2, with the
              northern offshore site having a CS-$\delta$15N 1--2‰ higher than
              the $\delta$15N of thermocline nitrate in the surrounding
              Sargasso Sea. Two annually resolved CS-$\delta$15N time series
              suggest that the offshore-inshore CS-$\delta$15N gradient has
              persisted since at least the 1970s. Plankton $\delta$15N among
              these 4 sites also has an inshore increase, but of only ∼1‰.
              Coral physiological change must explain the remaining (∼2‰)
              inshore increase in CS-$\delta$15N, and previous work points to
              the coral/zooxanthellae N cycle as a control on host tissue (and
              thus carbonate skeletal) $\delta$15N. The CS-$\delta$15N gradient
              is hypothesized to result mainly from varying efficiency in the
              internal nitrogen recycling of the coral/zooxanthellae symbiosis.
              It is proposed that, in more productive inshore waters, greater
              food uptake by the coral causes a greater fraction of its
              low-$\delta$15N regenerated ammonium to be excreted rather than
              assimilated by zooxanthellae, raising the $\delta$15N of the
              inshore corals. If so, coral tissue- and CS-$\delta$15N may prove
              of use to reconstruct and monitor the state of the
              coral/zooxanthellae symbiosis over space and time.",

               which can use either Cd or Zn as a metal center, are found in

               Cd in CDCA is the only known biological function of Cd and is
               thought to explain the nutrient-like concentration profile of Cd

               cultures of Thalassiosira weissflogii and in samples from the
               Equatorial Pacific and coastal New Jersey. CDCA1 is one of 2

               modulated by pH changes and is induced by the addition of Cd.
               Attempts to amplify cdca mRNA from samples of the Equatorial
               Pacific were not successful. However, protein bands from a

              calcite and aragonite seas on the evolution of carbonate
              skeletons. An earlier study based on 21 taxa that evolved
              skeletons during the Ediacaran through Ordovician suggested that
              carbonate skeletal mineralogy is determined by seawater chemistry
              at the time skeletons first evolve in a clade. Here I test this
              hypothesis using an expanded dataset comprising 40 well-defined
              animal taxa that evolved skeletons de novo in the last 600 Myr.
              Of the 37 taxa whose mineralogy is known with some confidence, 25
              acquired mineralogies that matched seawater chemistry of the
              time, whereas only two taxa acquired non-matching mineralogies.
              (Ten appeared during times when seawater chemistry is not well
              constrained.) The results suggest that calcite and aragonite seas
              do have a strong influence on carbonate skeletal mineralogy,
              however, this appears to be true only at the time mineralized
              skeletons first evolve. Few taxa switch mineralogies (from
              calcite to aragonite or vice versa) despite subsequent changes in
              seawater chemistry, and those that do switch do not appear to do
              so in response to changing aragonite--calcite seas. This suggests
              that there may be evolutionary constraints on skeletal
              mineralogy, and that although there may be increased costs
              associated with producing a mineralogy not favored by seawater,
              the costs of switching mineralogies are even greater.",

  abstract = "Calcium carbonate exists in two main forms, calcite and
              aragonite, in the skeletons of marine organisms. The primary
              mineralogy of marine carbonates has changed over the history of
              the earth depending on the Mg/Ca ratio in seawater during the
              periods of the so-called calcite and aragonite seas. Organisms
              that prefer certain mineralogy appear to flourish when their
              preferred mineralogy is favored by seawater chemistry. However,
              this rule is not without exceptions. For example, some octocorals
              produce calcite despite living in an aragonite sea. Here, we
              address the unresolved question of how organisms such as soft
              corals are able to form calcitic skeletal elements in an
              aragonite sea. We show that an extracellular protein called
              ECMP-67 isolated from soft coral sclerites induces calcite
              formation in vitro even when the composition of the calcifying
              solution favors aragonite precipitation. The results show that
              this protein is the main determining factor for driving the
              production of calcite instead of aragonite in the
              biocalcification process and that −OH, secondary structures
              (e.g., $\alpha$-helices and amides), and other necessary chemical
              groups are distributed over the center of the calcite crystals.
              Using an atomic force microscope, we also explored how this
              extracellular protein significantly affects the molecular-scale
              kinetics of crystal formation. We anticipate that a more thorough
              investigation of the proteinaceous skeleton content of different
              calcite-producing marine organisms will reveal similar components
              that determine the organisms mineralogy. These findings have

              previously viscous film was populated with swimming bacteria.
              Carbon dating of the film points to its relatively modern origin.
              A comparison of infrared spectra of modern biofilms with modern

              range and the quantifiable covariation of these parameters can
              provide diagnostic tools for understanding processes of
              fluid-rock interaction. Careful consideration of the
              uncertainties associated with trace element partitioning, sample
              heterogeneity and fluid-rock interaction mechanisms is required
              to advance the application of the trace element and isotope
              geochemistry of strontium to studies of diagenesis, goundwater
              evolution, ancient seawater chemistry and isotope stratigraphy. A
              principal uncertainty involved in the application of Sr
              concentration variations to carbonate systems is the large range
              of experimental and empirical results for trace element
              partitioning of Sr between mineral and solution. This variation
              may be a function of precipitation rate, mineral stoichiometry,
              crystal growth mechanism, fluid composition and temperature.
              Calcite and dolomite in ancient limestones commonly have
              significantly lower Sr concentrations (20--70 p.p.m.) than would
              be expected from published trace element distribution coefficient
              values and Sr/Ca ratios of most modern sedimentary pore waters.
              This discrepancy probably reflects the uncertainties associated
              with determining distribution coefficient values. As techniques
              improve for the analytical measurement and theoretical modelling
              of Sr concentration and isotopic variations, the petrological
              analysis of carbonate samples becomes increasingly important. The
              presence of even small percentages of non-carbonate phases with
              high Rb concentrations and high 87 Sr86 Sr values, such as clay

              Sr values of carbonate rocks, due to the decay of 87Rb to 87 Sr.
              For example, a Permian marine limestone with 50 p.p.m. Sr and 1
              p.p.m. Rb will have a present-day 87 Sr/86 Sr value that is >2
              $\times$ 10−4 higher than its original value. This difference is
              an order of magnitude greater than the analytical uncertainty,
              and illustrates the importance of assessing the need for and
              accuracy of such corrections. A quantitative evaluation of the
              effects of water-rock interaction on Sr concentrations and
              isotope compositions in carbonates strengthens the application of
              these geochemical tracers. Geochemical modelling that combines
              the use of trace elements and isotopes can be used to distinguish
              between different mechanisms of water-rock interaction, including
              diffusive and advective transport of diagenetic constituents in
              meteoric pore fluids during the recrystallization of carbonate
              minerals. Quantitative modelling may also be used to construct
              diagnostic fluid-rock interaction trends that are independent of
              distribution coefficient values, and to distinguish between
              mixing of mineral end-members and fluid-rock interaction.",

  abstract = "Basin-scale calcification rates are highly important in
              assessments of the global oceanic carbon cycle. Traditionally,
              such estimates were based on rates of sedimentation measured with
              sediment traps or in deep sea cores. Here we estimated CaCO3
              precipitation rates in the surface water of the Red Sea from
              total alkalinity depletion along their axial flow using the water
              flux in the straits of Bab el Mandeb. The relative contribution
              of coral reefs and open sea plankton were calculated by fitting a
              Rayleigh distillation model to the increase in the strontium to
              calcium ratio. We estimate the net amount of CaCO3 precipitated
              in the Red Sea to be 7.3 $\pm$ 0.4·1010 kg·y−1 of which 80 $\pm$
              5\% is by pelagic calcareous plankton and 20 $\pm$ 5\% is by the
              flourishing coastal coral reefs. This estimate for pelagic
              calcification rate is up to 40\% higher than published
              sedimentary CaCO3 accumulation rates for the region. The
              calcification rate of the Gulf of Aden was estimated by the
              Rayleigh model to be ∼1/2 of the Red Sea, and in the northwestern

              marine invertebrates will have to face the synergistic
              interactions of OA with other global and local stressors. One
              local factor, common in coastal environments, is trace element
              contamination. CO2 vent sites are extensively studied in the
              context of OA and are often considered analogous to the oceans in
              the next few decades. The CO2 vent found at Levante Bay (Vulcano,
              NE Sicily, Italy) also releases high concentrations of trace
              elements to its surrounding seawater, and is therefore a unique
              site to examine the effects of long-term exposure of nearby
              organisms to high pCO2 and trace element enrichment in situ. The
              sea anemone Anemonia viridis is prevalent next to the Vulcano
              vent and does not show signs of trace element poisoning/stress.
              The aim of our study was to compare A. viridis trace element
              profiles and compartmentalization between high pCO2 and control
              environments. Rather than examining whole anemone tissue, we
              analyzed two different body compartments---the pedal disc and the
              tentacles, and also examined the distribution of trace elements
              in the tentacles between the animal and the symbiotic algae. We
              found dramatic changes in trace element tissue concentrations
              between the high pCO2/high trace element and control sites, with
              strong accumulation of iron, lead, copper and cobalt, but
              decreased concentrations of cadmium, zinc and arsenic proximate
              to the vent. The pedal disc contained substantially more trace
              elements than the anemone's tentacles, suggesting the pedal disc
              may serve as a detoxification/storage site for excess trace
              elements. Within the tentacles, the various trace elements
              displayed different partitioning patterns between animal tissue
              and algal symbionts. At both sites iron was found primarily in
              the algae, whereas cadmium, zinc and arsenic were primarily found
              in the animal tissue. Our data suggests that A. viridis regulates
              its internal trace element concentrations by compartmentalization
              and excretion and that these features contribute to its

              ocean acidification has negative but variable impacts on

              ecosystem responses remain incomplete. Here we demonstrate that
              ocean acidification generates striking patterns of genome-wide
              selection in purple sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus)
              cultured under different CO2 levels. We examined genetic change
              at 19,493 loci in larvae from seven adult populations cultured
              under realistic future CO2 levels. Although larval development
              and morphology showed little response to elevated CO2, we found
              substantial allelic change in 40 functional classes of proteins
              involving hundreds of loci. Pronounced genetic changes, including
              excess amino acid replacements, were detected in all populations

              interact in pH regulation. Such genetic change represents a
              neglected and important impact of ocean acidification that may
              influence populations that show few outward signs of response to
              acidification. Our results demonstrate the capacity for rapid

              climate change in this coastal upwelling ecosystem. However,
              effective response to strong natural selection demands large

              economically-important clam Ruditapes philippinarum. The disease
              is caused by a bacterium, Vibrio tapetis, that colonizes the edge
              of the mantle, altering the biomineralization process and normal
              shell growth. Altered organic shell matrices accumulate on the
              inner face of the shell leading to the formation of the typical
              brown ring in the extrapallial space (between the mantle and the
              shell). Even though structural and functional changes have been
              described in solid (mantle) and fluid (hemolymph and extrapallial
              fluids) tissues from infected clams, the underlying molecular
              alterations and responses remain largely unknown. This study was
              designed to gather information on clam molecular responses to the

              infection (mantle and extrapallial fluid) with systemic
              (hemolymph) responses. To do so, we designed and produced a
              Manila clam expression oligoarray (15K Agilent) using

              platform to comparatively assess transcriptomic changes in

              barium/calcium ratio (Ba/Ca), and Chlorophyll-a concentration
              (Chl-a). From 2002 to 2004, ratios of the $\delta$15Ncoral varied
              between +0.8 and +8.3‰ with inverse variation to SST (r = −0.53).
              Ba/Ca ratios and Chl-a concentrations were also observed to be

              dynamics and a tool for understanding coral biogeochemistry and
              physiological processes. However, the existing methods for
              measuring the isotopic composition of coral skeleton-bound
              organic nitrogen (hereafter, CS-$\delta$15N) either require too
              much skeleton material or have low precision, limiting the
              applications of this relatively new proxy. In addition, the
              controlling factors on CS-$\delta$15N remain poorly understood:
              the $\delta$15N of source nitrogen and the internal nitrogen
              cycle of the coral/zooxanthellae symbiosis may both be important.
              Here, we describe a new (``persulfate/denitrifier''-based) method
              for measuring CS-$\delta$15N, requiring only 5 mg of skeleton
              material and yielding a long-term precision better than 0.2‰
              (1$\sigma$). Using this new method, we investigate CS-$\delta$15N
              at Bermuda. Ten modern Diploria labyrinthiformis coral
              cores/colonies from 4 sampling sites were measured for
              CS-$\delta$15N. Nitrogen concentrations (nitrate + nitrite,
              ammonium, and dissolved organic nitrogen) and $\delta$15N of
              plankton were also measured at these coral sites. Among the 4
              sampling sites, CS-$\delta$15N shows an increase with proximity
              to the island, from ∼3.8‰ to ∼6.8‰ vs. atmospheric N2, with the
              northern offshore site having a CS-$\delta$15N 1--2‰ higher than
              the $\delta$15N of thermocline nitrate in the surrounding
              Sargasso Sea. Two annually resolved CS-$\delta$15N time series
              suggest that the offshore-inshore CS-$\delta$15N gradient has
              persisted since at least the 1970s. Plankton $\delta$15N among
              these 4 sites also has an inshore increase, but of only ∼1‰.
              Coral physiological change must explain the remaining (∼2‰)
              inshore increase in CS-$\delta$15N, and previous work points to
              the coral/zooxanthellae N cycle as a control on host tissue (and
              thus carbonate skeletal) $\delta$15N. The CS-$\delta$15N gradient
              is hypothesized to result mainly from varying efficiency in the
              internal nitrogen recycling of the coral/zooxanthellae symbiosis.
              It is proposed that, in more productive inshore waters, greater
              food uptake by the coral causes a greater fraction of its
              low-$\delta$15N regenerated ammonium to be excreted rather than
              assimilated by zooxanthellae, raising the $\delta$15N of the
              inshore corals. If so, coral tissue- and CS-$\delta$15N may prove
              of use to reconstruct and monitor the state of the
              coral/zooxanthellae symbiosis over space and time.",

              1970--1971, when synthetic fertilizers (−0.8‰ $\pm$ 0.2‰) were

              3.5‰ $\pm$ 0.4\% in the mid-1990s. $\delta$15N values were

              the extent of N isotopic alteration. Moreover, the compiled data

              systematically enriched in Rapid Accretion Deposits (RADs)
              compared to surrounding fibres, or Thickening Deposits (TDs), and
              present huge variations that cannot be ascribed to any
              environmental parameter change. Moreover, these elemental ratios
              are positively correlated in the three coral species. We explore
              different mechanisms to explain these observations: (1) mixing
              between different carrier phases, (2) influence of specific ion
              pumps, (3) precipitation rate effects, (4) Rayleigh
              fractionation, and (5) pH change in the calcifying fluid. Of
              these possibilities, the most likely proposal seems to be kinetic
              effects that have influence on the number of defects (i.e.,
              modification of the crystallographic structure), which are linked
              to the precipitation rate of the skeleton, and the partition
              coefficients are the cause of the positive correlation between
              Li, Na, and Mg in the coral skeleton. Temperature has an indirect
              influence on the skeletal concentration of these elements through
              its effect on the skeletal growth rate.",

              globally increased temperatures about 55.9 million years ago,
              characterized the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. Its effect
              on global oceanic productivity is controversial. Here we present
              records of marine barite accumulation rates that show distinct
              peaks during this time interval, suggesting a general increase in
              export productivity. We propose that changes in marine
              ecosystems, resulting from high atmospheric partial pressure of
              CO2 and ocean acidification, led to enhanced carbon export from
              the photic zone to depth, thereby increasing the efficiency of
              the biological pump. Higher seawater temperatures at that time
              increased bacterial activity and organic matter regeneration.
              Through this process much of the sinking particulate organic
              matter was probably converted to dissolved inorganic and organic
              carbon. We estimate that an annual carbon export flux out of the
              euphotic zone and into the deep ocean waters could have amounted
              to about 15 Gt during the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum.
              About 0.4\% of this carbon is expected to have entered the
              refractory dissolved organic pool, where it could be sequestered
              from the atmosphere for tens of thousands of years. Our estimates
              are consistent with the amount of carbon redistribution expected

              whether corals will be able to adapt or acclimate to these

              of the Galapagos Rift about 30 years ago, the chemoautotrophic
              symbiosis between the vestimentiferan tubeworm Riftia pachyptila
              and its symbiotic sulfide-oxidizing gamma-proteobacteria has been
              extensively studied. However, studies on the tubeworm host were
              essentially targeted, biochemical approaches. We decided to use a
              global molecular approach to identify new proteins involved in
              metabolite exchanges and assimilation by the host. We used a
              Subtractive Suppression Hybridization approach (SSH) in an
              unusual way, by comparing pairs of tissues from a single
              individual. We chose to identify the sequences preferentially
              expressed in the branchial plume tissue (the only organ in
              contact with the sea water) and in the trophosome (the organ
              housing the symbiotic bacteria) using the body wall as a
              reference tissue because it is supposedly not involved in
              metabolite exchanges in this species.RESULTS:We produced four
              cDNA libraries: i) body wall-subtracted branchial plume library
              (BR-BW), ii) and its reverse library, branchial plume-subtracted
              body wall library (BW-BR), iii) body wall-subtracted trophosome
              library (TR-BW), iv) and its reverse library,
              trophosome-subtracted body wall library (BW-TR). For each
              library, we sequenced about 200 clones resulting in 45 different
              sequences on average in each library (58 and 59 cDNAs for BR-BW
              and TR-BW libraries respectively). Overall, half of the contigs
              matched records found in the databases with good E-values. After
              quantitative PCR analysis, it resulted that 16S, Major Vault
              Protein, carbonic anhydrase (RpCAbr), cathepsin and chitinase
              precursor transcripts were highly represented in the branchial
              plume tissue compared to the trophosome and the body wall
              tissues, whereas carbonic anhydrase (RpCAtr), myohemerythrin, a
              putative T-Cell receptor and one non identified transcript were
              highly specific of the trophosome tissue.CONCLUSION:Quantitative
              PCR analyses were congruent with our libraries results thereby
              confirming the existence of tissue-specific transcripts
              identified by SSH. We focused our study on the transcripts we
              identified as the most interesting ones based on the BLAST
              results. Some of the keys to understanding metabolite exchanges
              may remain in the sequences we could not identify (hypothetical
              proteins and no similarity found). These sequences will have to
              be better studied by a longer -or complete- sequencing to check
              their identity, and then by verifying the expression level of the

              emissions, leading to reduced seawater-pH (termed `ocean

              unavailable from well-ventilated areas of the deep ocean,
              necessitating proxy records to improve spatio-temporal
              understanding on the rate and magnitude of deep ocean
              acidification. Here we investigate boron, carbon, and oxygen
              isotopes on live-collected deep-sea bamboo corals (genus
              Keratoisis) from a pHtot range of 7.5 to 8.1. These analyses are
              used to explore the potential for using bamboo coral skeletons as
              archives of past deep-sea pH and to trace anthropogenic
              acidification in the subsurface North Atlantic Ocean (850-2000 m
              water depth). Boron isotope ratios of the most recently secreted
              calcite of bamboo coral skeletons are close to the calculated
              isotopic composition of borate anion in seawater
              ($\delta$11Bborate) for North Atlantic corals, and 1-2‰ higher
              than $\delta$11Bborate for Pacific corals. Within individual
              coral skeletons, carbon and oxygen isotopes correlate positively
              and linearly, a feature associated with vital effects during
              coral calcification. $\delta$11B variability of 0.5 to 2‰ is
              observed within single specimens, which exceeds the expected
              anthropogenic trend in modern North Atlantic corals. $\delta$11B
              values are generally elevated in Pacific corals relative to
              $\delta$11Bborate, which may reflect pH-driven physiological
              processes aiding coral calcification in environments unfavorable
              for calcite precipitation. Elevated $\delta$11B values are also
              observed proximal to the central axis in multiple Atlantic and
              Pacific specimens, relative to $\delta$11Bborate, which might
              reflect ontogenetic variability in calcification rates. Although
              the observed boron isotope variability is too large to resolve
              the present anthropogenic ocean acidification signal at the
              studied depths in the North Atlantic (∼0.03 to 0.07 pH units), pH
              changes ⩾ 0.1 units might still be reconstructed using

              modular organisms to climate change and the potential to adapt
              through morphological plasticity related to their modularity.
              Here, we investigate the effects of ocean acidification and
              seawater warming on the growth, life history and morphological
              plasticity in the modular bryozoan Calpensia nobilis using
              transplantation experiments in a shallow Mediterranean volcanic
              CO2 vents system that simulates pH values expected for the year
              2100. Colonies exposed at vent sites grew at approximately half
              the rate of those from the control site. Between days 34 and 48
              of the experiment, they reached a possible `threshold', due to
              the combined effects of exposure time and pH. Temperature did not
              affect zooid length, but longer zooids with wider primary
              orifices occurred in low pH conditions close to the vents. Growth
              models describing colony development under different
              environmental scenarios suggest that stressed colonies of C.
              nobilis reallocate metabolic energy to the consolidation and
              strengthening of existing zooids. This is interpreted as a change
              in life-history strategy to support persistence under
              unfavourable environmental conditions. Changes in the skeletal
              morphology of zooids evident in C. nobilis during short-time (87
              days) exposure experiments reveal morphological plasticity that
              may indicate a potential to adapt to the more acidic

              unfavorable calcification conditions. However, the mechanisms
              enabling this biological plasticity are yet to be identified.
              Here we show that incubation of two coral species (Pocillopora
              damicornis and Oculina patagonica) under reduced pH conditions
              (pH 7.2) simulating past ocean acidification induce
              tissue-specific apoptosis that leads to the dissociation of
              polyps from coenosarcs. This in turn leads to the breakdown of
              the coenosarc and, as a consequence, to loss of coloniality. Our
              data show that apoptosis is initiated in the polyps and that once
              dissociation between polyp and coenosarc terminates, apoptosis
              subsides. After reexposure of the resulting solitary polyps to
              normal pH (pH 8.2), both coral species regenerated coenosarc
              tissues and resumed calcification. These results indicate that
              regulation of coloniality is under the control of the polyp, the
              basic modular unit of the colony. A mechanistic explanation for
              several key evolutionarily important phenomena that occurred

              At the fish farm, however, burial of the nubbin's lateral growths
              and partial coverage of nubbins by settled particulate matter
              resulted in significant reduction of the lateral growth rates of
              nubbins settled in the up position as compared to the reference
              site. On the other hand, faster growth rates were recorded in the
              vertical set of nubbins at the fish farm when compared with the
              IUI site. These results strengthen the conclusion that physical
              effects, rather than nutrient enrichment, may constitute the main
              cause of stress for minute coral fragments (resembling coral

              Symbiodinium to an elevated pCO2 was phylotype-specific.
              Phylotypes A1 and B1 were largely unaffected by a doubling in
              pCO2; in contrast, the growth rate of A13 and the photosynthetic
              capacity of A2 both increased by ~ 60\%. In no case was there an

              important queen conch, Strombus gigas (Linnaeus 1758). The eggs
              of S. gigas are aposymbiotic, but acquisition of Symbiodinium at

              investigate the symbiotic association between adult S. gigas and
              Symbiodinium. S. gigas were collected along the Mexican Caribbean
              coast. Symbiodinium did not occur in the muscle tissue or gonads,
              the latter supporting the lack of symbionts in S. gigas' eggs.
              Symbiodinium cells were morphologically intact in all of the
              anatomical structures in which they were found that included, in
              order of abundance, the digestive gland and other parts of the

              their morphology and mitotic index, was surprising given the low
              light habitat in which they were found in adult S. gigas. The
              shell of S. gigas is a strong light attenuator; a maximum of 21\%
              of incident radiation passed through the conch shell and
              decreased exponentially with increasing shell length to a low of
              0.1\%. The maximal photochemical efficiencies (Fv/Fm) of the
              symbionts were low, suggesting that their photosynthetic activity
              would be suboptimal in the reduced light environment in which
              they are found. The large population of Symbiodinium may be
              maintained by the symbionts acquiring nutrients heterotrophically
              from the host. Consequently, in S. gigas, a mutualistic symbiont

              partly mediated by the activity of microorganisms. The vast
              majority of studies on phosphorites have focused on a
              petrological and geochemical characterization of these rocks.
              However, detailed descriptions are needed at the sub-micrometer
              scale at which crucial information can be retrieved about traces
              of past or modern microbial activities. Here, scanning electron
              microscopy (SEM) analyses of a recent phosphorite crust from the
              upwelling-style phosphogenesis area off Peru revealed that it
              contained a great number of rod-like and coccus-like shaped
              micrometer-sized (~ 1.1 $\mu$m and 0.5 $\mu$m, respectively)
              objects, referred to as biomorphs. Some of these biomorphs were
              filled with carbonate fluoroapatite (CFA, a calcium-phosphate
              phase common in phosphorites); some were empty; some were
              surrounded by one or two layers of pyrite. Transmission electron
              microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDXS)
              analyses were performed on focused ion beam (FIB) milled
              ultrathin foils to characterize the texture of CFA and pyrite in
              these biomorphs at the few nanometer scale. Non-pyritized
              phosphatic biomorphs were surrounded by a thin (5--15 nm thick)
              rim appearing as a void on TEM images. Bundles of CFA crystals
              sharing the same crystallographic orientations (aligned along
              their c-axis) were found in the interior of some biomorphs.
              Pyrite formed a thick (~ 35--115 nm) layer with closely packed
              crystals surrounding the pyritized biomorphs, whereas pyrite
              crystals at distance from the biomorphs were smaller and
              distributed more sparsely. Scanning transmission X-ray microscopy
              (STXM) analyses performed at the C K-edge provided maps of
              organic and inorganic carbon in the samples. Inorganic C, mainly
              present as carbonate groups in the CFA lattice, was homogeneously
              distributed, whereas organic C was concentrated in the rims of
              the phosphatic biomorphs. Finally, STXM analyses at the Fe
              L2,3-edges together with TEM-EDXS analyses, revealed that some
              pyritized biomorphs experienced partial oxidation. The
              mineralogical features of these phosphatic biomorphs are very
              similar to those formed by bacteria having precipitated phosphate
              minerals intra- and extracellularly in laboratory experiments.
              Similarly, pyritized biomorphs resemble bacteria encrusted by
              pyrite. We therefore interpret phosphatic and pyritized biomorphs
              present in the Peruvian phosphorite crust as microorganisms
              fossilized near the boundary of zones of sulfate reduction. The
              implications of these observations are then discussed in the
              light of the different possible and non-exclusive
              microbially-driven phosphogenesis mechanisms that have been
              proposed in the past: (i) Organic matter mineralization, in
              particular mediated by iron reducing bacteria and/or
              sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), (ii) reduction of
              iron-(oxyhydr)oxides by iron-reducing bacteria and/or SRB, and
              (iii) polyphosphate metabolism in sulfide-oxidizing bacteria,

              Our methodological approach included isolation of metal oxides by
              physical fractionation and visualization of their interaction

              consistent with regional differences in temperature regimes for
              the stony coral Oculina patagonica. To resolve this question, we
              experimentally assessed how colonies originating from four
              different locations characterized by >3 °C variation in mean
              maximum annual temperature responded to warming from 20 to 32 °C.
              We assessed plasticity in symbiont identity, density, and
              photosynthetic properties, together with changes in host tissue
              biomass. Results show that, without changes in the type of
              symbiont hosted by coral colonies, O. patagonica has limited
              capacity to acclimatize to future warming. We found little

              optima, in response to spatial variation in ambient temperature.
              Given that the invader O. patagonica is a relatively new member

              photosynthesis and, therefore, does not lead to bleaching).

  abstract = "Stable isotope ratios of carbon ($\delta$13C) and oxygen
              ($\delta$18O) from tree ring cellulose can provide valuable
              paleoclimatic information at annual and subannual resolution,
              from time periods long before instrumental climate records.
              Recently, mummified (non-permineralized) wood was discovered
              within Canadian Subarctic kimberlites, inviting paleoclimatic
              investigations of the time in which the trees grew. In the
              mummified wood, polysaccharides (hemicellulose,
              $\alpha$-cellulose) are frequently preferentially degraded, in
              the low-silica anaerobic burial environment of the kimberlites,
              resulting in a lignin-rich material. However, some samples from
              the Ekati Panda kimberlite pipe (ca. 53.3 Ma) contain remnant
              cellulose, demonstrating the extraordinary preservation potential
              of kimberlites. Preservation of $\alpha$-cellulose is important
              because it allows for the construction of stable isotopic proxy
              records of deep-time paleoclimates at annual to subannual
              resolution. Established $\alpha$-cellulose extraction methods
              [i.e., using a 17.5 \% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution] were
              unsuitable for this material because all holocellulose was
              dissolved. Therefore, we tested variants of two cellulose
              extraction methods [i.e., Brendel et al. (2000) and Jayme-Wise
              (Leavitt and Danzer 1993, Loader et al. 1997) to optimize a
              procedure for extraction of a consistent yield of mummified wood
              cellulose for stable isotopic analysis. Stable carbon
              ($\delta$13C) and oxygen ($\delta$18O) isotopes were measured
              from cellulose from each extraction method, as well as
              extractive-free wood and unextracted mummified wood. Vitrinite
              Reflectance, used to assess thermal alteration of the unextracted
              material to estimate post-burial temperatures within the
              kimberlite, suggested low post-burial peak temperatures (Tpeak =
              60 °C). We detected no mineral contaminants (i.e., iron oxides)
              in the material using Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX).
              Despite low cellulose yield (< 5 \%), the Attenuated Total
              Reflection Fourier-Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra of
              mummified cellulose samples strongly resembled modern
              $\alpha$-cellulose. All cellulose treatments were similar in
              stable isotope values and ATR-FTIR peaks, but significantly
              different from unextracted wood and extractive-free wood. As,
              reported by other sources (Anchukaitis et al. 2008, Brookman and
              Whittaker 2012), use of the Brendel method may cause cellulose
              acetylation, introducing an FTIR peak near 1720 cm- 1, thus
              complicating hemicellulose detection at a peak near 1725 cm- 1.
              For this reason, the Jayme-Wise method is recommended for
              detection of hemicelluloses in mummified wood. If hemicelluloses
              are not present in holocellulose, due to groundwater hydrolysis,
              the NaOH step may be omitted or reduced in concentration and
              still produce $\alpha$-cellulose.",

              symbiotic algae that reside in their tissue. The internal
              pathways that deliver Ci for both photosynthesis and
              calcification are known to involve the enzyme carbonic anhydrase
              (CA), which interconverts CO2 and HCO3−. We have developed a
              method for absolute quantification of internal CA (iCA) activity
              in coral tissue based on the rate of 18O-removal from labeled Ci.
              The method was applied to three Caribbean corals (Orbicella
              faveolata, Porites astreoides, and Siderastrea radians) and
              showed that these species have similar iCA activities per unit
              surface area, but that S. radians had ∼10-fold higher iCA
              activity per unit tissue volume. A model of coral Ci processing
              shows that the measured iCA activity is sufficient to support the
              proposed roles for iCA in Ci transport for photosynthesis and
              calcification. This is the case even when iCA activity is
              homogeneously distributed throughout the coral, but the model
              indicates that it would be advantageous to concentrate iCA in the
              spaces where calcification (the calcifying fluid) and
              photosynthesis (the oral endoderm) take place. We argue that
              because the rates of photosynthesis and calcification per unit
              surface area are similar among the corals studied here, the areal
              iCA activity used to deliver Ci for these reactions should also
              be similar. The elevated iCA activity per unit volume of S.
              radians compared to the other species is probably due to the
              thinner effective tissue thickness in this species.",

              light calcification declined in S. hystrix at high pCO2, but were
              unaffected by pCO2 in the other three coral taxa. Dark and net
              calcification rates remained unchanged in massive Porites and P.
              damicornis, but were drastically reduced at high pCO2 in A.

              similar at both seep and control sites in all coral taxa

              characterized by an increased ability to acclimatize to ocean

              techniques in studying paleoenvironmental proxies continues to
              increase. We evaluate the accuracy and precision of the CAMECA
              ims 7F-GEO and NanoSIMS-50L ion probes for measurements of Sr/Ca,
              Mg/Ca, and Ba/Ca ratios in carbonate minerals. Nine carbonate
              reference materials were examined for their 88Sr/42Ca, 24Mg/42Ca,
              and 138Ba/42Ca ratios using a primary O− beam with spot sizes of
              20--40 $\mu$m (SIMS) and 0.8--2 $\mu$m (NanoSIMS). To assess
              accuracy, seven of these standards were analyzed for Sr/Ca and

              from drift and changes in the tuning of the ims 7F-GEO over a
              nine month period is smaller than the chemical heterogeneity of
              the most frequently analyzed standards (OKA and Blue-CC). Across
              a whole crystal, Blue-CC is more homogeneous (1$\sigma$ of 2.39\%
              and 1.60\% for Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca respectively) than OKA, but in the
              bulk matrix of OKA there is even less variability (1$\sigma$ of
              0.85\% and 0.83\% respectively). We find that carbonate samples
              can be accurately normalized to carbonate standards with
              significantly different absolute Me/Ca ratios. NanoSIMS intensity
              ratios follow counting statistics better than $\pm$ 1\%
              (2$\sigma$) at any one spot, but conversion to Me/Ca ratios
              increases the uncertainty. Two factors give rise to this
              limitation. First, the spatial heterogeneity of nominally
              homogeneous standards can lead to accuracy offsets that are as
              large as the ranges quoted above. Second, the NanoSIMS generates
              higher instrumental mass fractionation relative to SIMS. The
              combination of three different analytical techniques demonstrates
              that Blue-CC and homogeneous calcite zones in OKA are promising
              reference materials for precise analyses. Accuracy is crucially

              acidification is proposed to reduce calcification rates in corals
              by causing declines in internal pH at the calcifying
              tissue--skeleton interface where biomineralization takes place.
              Here, we performed an in vivo study on how partial-pressure
              CO2-driven seawater acidification impacts intracellular pH in
              coral calcifying cells and extracellular pH in the fluid at the
              tissue--skeleton interface [subcalicoblastic medium (SCM)] in the
              coral Stylophora pistillata. We also measured calcification in
              corals grown under the same conditions of seawater acidification
              by measuring lateral growth of colonies and growth of aragonite
              crystals under the calcifying tissue. Our findings confirm that
              seawater acidification decreases pH of the SCM, but this decrease
              is gradual relative to the surrounding seawater, leading to an
              increasing pH gradient between the SCM and seawater. Reductions
              in calcification rate, both at the level of crystals and whole
              colonies, were only observed in our lowest pH treatment when pH
              was significantly depressed in the calcifying cells in addition
              to the SCM. Overall, our findings suggest that reef corals may
              mitigate the effects of seawater acidification by regulating pH
              in the SCM, but they also highlight the role of calcifying cell
              pH homeostasis in determining the response of reef corals to
              changes in external seawater pH and carbonate chemistry.",

  abstract = "Since the preindustrial era, the average surface ocean pH has
              declined by 0.1 pH units and is predicted to decline by an
              additional 0.3 units by the year 2100. Although subtle, this
              decreasing pH has profound effects on the seawater saturation
              state of carbonate minerals and is thus predicted to impact on
              calcifying organisms. Among these are the scleractinian corals,
              which are the main builders of tropical coral reefs. Several
              recent studies have evaluated the physiological impact of low pH,
              particularly in relation to coral growth and calcification.
              However, very few studies have focused on the impact of low pH at
              the global molecular level. In this context we investigated
              global transcriptomic modifications in a scleractinian coral
              (Pocillopora damicornis) exposed to pH 7.4 compared to pH
              8.1during a 3-week period. The RNAseq approach shows that 16\% of
              our transcriptome was affected by the treatment with 6\% of
              upregulations and 10\% of downregulations. A more detailed
              analysis suggests that the downregulations are less coordinated
              than the upregulations and allowed the identification of several
              biological functions of interest. In order to better understand
              the links between these functions and the pH, transcript
              abundance of 48 candidate genes was quantified by q-RT-PCR
              (corals exposed at pH 7.2 and 7.8 for 3 weeks). The combined
              results of these two approaches suggest that pH$\geq$7.4 induces
              an upregulation of genes coding for proteins involved in calcium
              and carbonate transport, conversion of CO2 into HCO3− and organic
              matrix that may sustain calcification. Concomitantly, genes
              coding for heterotrophic and autotrophic related proteins are
              upregulated. This can reflect that low pH may increase the coral
              energy requirements, leading to an increase of energetic
              metabolism with the mobilization of energy reserves. In addition,
              the uncoordinated downregulations measured can reflect a general
              trade-off mechanism that may enable energy reallocation.",

              This study investigates potential interactions between food

              respiration), energy status (lipid concentrations), total protein

              °C) over 15 days. Feeding experiments were carried out in which
              the corals were either fed daily with zooplankton or starved.
              Compared to fed corals, starvation of both species resulted in a
              significant decrease in daily photosynthetic oxygen evolution
              over time. Gross (Pg) and net (Pn) photosynthetic production of
              starved corals of both species between 10:00-11:00 hrs had
              declined by ~50\% at day 15 while there were no marked changes in
              Pg and Pn of fed corals. After 15 days, starved S. pistillata
              contained significantly lower zooxanthellae densities, lipid and
              protein concentrations than fed corals. Starved G. fascicularis
              also displayed a decrease in zooxantllae densities which was
              accompanied by a significant decline in algal chl concentrations.
              Contrary to S. pistillata, feeding treatment had no effect on the
              lipid concentrations of G. fascicularis. Total protein
              concentrations however were significantly lower in straved than

              the respiration rates of G. fascicularis. Overall the oxygen

              factor leading to a decrease in the calcification of marine
              organisms. To provide a physiological explanation for this
              phenomenon, the effect of seawater acidification was studied on
              the calcification and photosynthesis of the scleractinian
              tropical coral Stylophora pistillata. Coral nubbins were
              incubated for 8 days at three different pH (7.6, 8.0, and 8.2).
              To differentiate between the effects of the various components of
              the carbonate chemistry (pH, CO32−, HCO3−, CO2, $\Omega$), tanks
              were also maintained under similar pH, but with 2-mM HCO3− added
              to the seawater. The addition of 2-mM bicarbonate significantly
              increased the photosynthesis in S. pistillata, suggesting
              carbon-limited conditions. Conversely, photosynthesis was
              insensitive to changes in pH and pCO2. Seawater acidification
              decreased coral calcification by ca. 0.1-mg CaCO3 g−1 d−1 for a
              decrease of 0.1 pH units. This correlation suggested that
              seawater acidification affected coral calcification by decreasing
              the availability of the CO32− substrate for calcification.
              However, the decrease in coral calcification could also be
              attributed either to a decrease in extra- or intracellular pH or
              to a change in the buffering capacity of the medium, impairing

              ocean acidification on calcification in 18 benthic marine
              organisms. Species were selected to span a broad taxonomic range

              the pH of surface seawater is decreasing with potentially
              negative impacts on coral calcification. A critical question is
              whether corals will be able to adapt or acclimate to these
              changes in seawater chemistry. We use high precision CT scanning
              of skeletal cores of Porites astreoides, an important Caribbean

              significantly along a natural gradient in pH and aragonite
              saturation ($\Omega$arag). This decrease is accompanied by an
              increase in skeletal erosion and predation by boring organisms.
              The degree of sensitivity to reduced $\Omega$arag measured on our
              field corals is consistent with that exhibited by the same
              species in laboratory CO2 manipulation experiments. We conclude

              The synthesis of such a protein by the calcifying epithelium of

              organization and gene inventory. Sequencing reads from
              Symbiodinium minutum were assembled into 616 Mbp gene-rich DNA
              regions that represented roughly half of the estimated 1,500 Mbp
              genome of this species. The assembly encoded <42,000
              protein-coding genes, consistent with previous dinoflagellate
              gene number estimates using transcriptomic data. The Symbiodinium
              genome contains duplicated genes for regulator of chromosome
              condensation proteins, nearly one-third of which have eukaryotic
              orthologs, whereas the remainder have most likely been acquired
              through bacterial horizontal gene transfers. Symbiodinium genes
              are enriched in spliceosomal introns (mean†= 18.6 introns/gene).
              Donor and acceptor splice sites are unique, with 52 sites
              utilizing not only GT but also GC and GA, whereas at 32 sites, a
              conserved G is present after AG. All spliceosomal snRNA genes (U1
              U6) are clustered in the genome. Surprisingly, the Symbiodinium

              chemistry reconstructions, and ambiguities introduced by sample
              diagenesis. We validated the preservation of a suite of ∼60
              unrecrystallized aragonitic fossil scleractinian corals, ranging
              in age from Triassic through Recent, for use as new archives of
              past seawater chemistry. Optical and secondary electron
              microscopy (SEM) studies reveal that fossil coral crystal fabrics

              secondary calcite. In order to screen for geochemical changes

              isotopes, and trace element ratios sensitive to diagenesis (e.g.,
              Mn/Ca). We retain samples when these tests either fail to
              identify any diagenetic modifications, or identify specific
              domains free of detectable alteration. Using the validated fossil

              measured by Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS), back to ∼230

              incorporation cannot explain the trends observed in our fossil
              coral Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca data. In agreement with independent
              records, seawater Mg/Ca molar ratios inferred from corals are low
              (Mg/Ca ∼1) during the Cretaceous and Jurassic, and increase
              between the Early Cenozoic and present (Mg/Ca = 5.2). Seawater
              Sr/Ca ratios from corals vary systematically between ∼8 and 13
              mmol/mol since 230 Ma, with maximum values in the Cretaceous and
              Paleogene. The coral Sr/Ca record disagrees with records from
              hydrothermal CaCO3 veins, but is similar to those reconstructed
              from other biogenic carbonates, especially benthic foraminifera.
              The agreement between corals and other archives, for both Sr/Ca
              and Mg/Ca ratios, further validates our records. In return,

              spicules may be demineralized and the integral matrix dissolves.
              The matrix is composed of a limited number of glycoproteins rich
              in aspx, glux, gly, ser, and ala, a composition not unlike that
              found in matrix proteins of biomineralized tissues of molluscs,
              sponges, and arthropods. There is no evidence for collagen as a
              component of the matrix. The matrix contains N-linked
              glycoproteins of the complex type. The matrix arises primarily
              from proteins synthesized from late gastrulation onward, during
              the time that spicule deposition occurs. The mixture of proteins
              binds calcium and is an effective immunogen. Electrophoresis of
              the glycoproteins on SDS-containing acrylamide gels, followed by
              blotting and immunocytochemical detection, reveals major
              components of approximately 47, 50, 57, and 64 kD, and several
              minor components. These same components may be detected with
              silver staining or fluorography of amino acid-labeled proteins.
              In addition to providing convenient molecular marker for the
              study of the development of the micromere lineage, the spicule
              matrix glycoproteins provide an interesting system for
              investigations in biomineralization.",

              adhesion of both cultured aortic endothelial cells and aortic
              smooth muscle cells. Adhesion of vascular cells to osteopontin
              was dose dependent and half maximal when solutions containing 7
              and 30 nmol/L osteopontin were used to coat wells for endothelial
              and smooth muscle cells, respectively. Smooth muscle cells
              adherent to osteopontin were spread after 60 minutes, whereas
              endothelial cells remained round, although flattened, at this
              time point but were spread at 90 minutes. Cell spreading on
              osteopontin was accompanied by the formation of focal adhesion
              plaques. A newly developed anti-osteopontin antibody completely
              inhibited adhesion of both cell types to osteopontin but not to
              fibronectin or vitronectin. In addition, the peptide GRGDSP
              blocked adhesion to osteopontin, suggesting that integrins
              mediate Arg-Gly-Asp-dependent adhesion. Indeed, an antibody
              against the alpha v beta 3 integrin neutralized adhesion of both
              endothelium and smooth muscle cells to osteopontin by
              approximately 50\%, demonstrating that alpha v beta 3 is one
              osteopontin receptor on vascular cells. Osteopontin also promoted
              the migration of smooth muscle cells in a Boyden-type chamber,
              with half-maximal effects observed at 77 nmol/L osteopontin.
              Checkerboard analysis demonstrated that this stimulus was

              be functionally important as an adhesive and chemotactic molecule
              for vascular cells, particularly when levels of osteopontin are
              dramatically increased, as is the case after arterial angioplasty

              well-understood and fossil documentation of these characters is
              incomplete. As a result, relationships among families and
              suborders are poorly understood. We have analyzed a 225 bp
              segment of the nuclear 28S ribosomal RNA gene from 45 species of
              corals and a 566 bp segment of the mitochondrial 16S ribosomal
              RNA gene from 68 species. Unlike previous analyses of smaller
              numbers of taxa, the dataset presented here includes both
              reef-building and non-reef-building taxa from 20 of 24 families
              and all seven suborders. Nuclear sequences analyzed under maximum
              parsimony and minimum evolution criteria did not resolve
              relationships among families and suborders. Similar analyses of
              mitochondrial sequences resulted in a robust phylogenetic
              hypothesis. The mitochondrial hypothesis, like previous analyses
              of a subset of these data, did not agree with morphological
              hypotheses about relationships among families and suborders, and
              supports a polyphyletic origin of the scleractinian skeleton.
              Instead of seven major monophyletic groups as hypothesized from
              morphological data, mitochondrial data suggest that the
              Scleractinia is represented by two major clades. Relationships
              within these major clades are not clearly differentiated but each
              clade is comprised of families from different morphological
              suborders as defined by Veron (1995). The mitochondrial topology

              recorded in coral skeleton could provide new insight into the
              connections between sub-seasonal to centennial scale nutrient
              dynamics, ocean physics, and primary production in the past.
              Previous work showed that coralline P/Ca, a novel seawater
              phosphate proxy, varies synchronously with annual
              upwelling-driven cycles in surface water phosphate concentration.
              However, paired contemporaneous seawater phosphate time-series
              data, needed for rigorous calibration of the new proxy, were
              lacking. Here we present further development of the P/Ca proxy in
              Porites lutea and Montastrea sp. corals, showing that skeletal
              P/Ca in colonies from geographically distinct oceanic nutrient
              regimes is a linear function of seawater phosphate (PO4 SW)
              concentration. Further, high-resolution P/Ca records in multiple
              colonies of Pavona gigantea and Porites lobata corals grown at
              the same upwelling location in the Gulf of Panam{\'a} were
              strongly correlated to a contemporaneous time-series record of
              surface water PO4 SW at this site (r2 = 0.7--0.9). This study
              supports application of the following multi-colony calibration
              equations to down-core records from comparable upwelling sites,
              resulting in $\pm$0.2 and $\pm$0.1 $\mu$mol/kg uncertainties in
              PO4 SW reconstructions from P. lobata and P. gigantea,
              respectively. P / Ca Porites lobata ( $\mu$ mol / mol ) = ( 21.1
              $\pm$ 2.4 ) PO 4 SW ( $\mu$ mol / kg ) + ( 14.3 $\pm$ 3.8 ) P /
              Ca Pavona gigantea ( $\mu$ mol / mol ) = ( 29.2 $\pm$ 1.4 ) PO 4
              SW ( $\mu$ mol / kg ) + ( 33.4 $\pm$ 2.7 ) Inter-colony agreement
              in P/Ca response to PO4 SW was good ($\pm$5--12\% about mean
              calibration slope), suggesting that species-specific calibration
              slopes can be applied to new coral P/Ca records to reconstruct
              past changes in surface ocean phosphate. However, offsets in the
              y-intercepts of calibration regressions among co-located
              individuals and taxa suggest that biologically-regulated ``vital
              effects'' and/or skeletal extension rate may also affect skeletal
              P incorporation. Quantification of the effect of skeletal
              extension rate on P/Ca could lead to corrected calibration
              equations and improved inter-colony P/Ca agreement. Nevertheless,
              the efficacy of the P/Ca proxy is thus supported by both broad
              scale correlation to mean surface water phosphate and regional
              calibration against documented local seawater phosphate
              variations.",

              Mature Lytechinus variegatus teeth were demineralized with 0.6 n

              on ceramic hydroxyapatite and separated into bound and unbound
              pools. Gel electrophoresis compared the protein distributions.
              The differentially present bands were purified and digested with
              trypsin, and the tryptic peptides were separated by high pressure
              liquid chromatography. NH2-terminal sequences were determined by
              Edman degradation and compared with the genomic sequence bank

              found. Their complete amino acid sequences were cloned from our
              L. variegatus cDNA library. Apatite-binding UTMP16 was found to
              be present in two isoforms; both isoforms had a signal sequence,
              a Ser-Asp-rich extracellular matrix domain, and a transmembrane

              classification has been marked by confusion but recently
              developed molecular and morphological tools are now leading to a
              better understanding of the evolutionary history of this
              important group. Although morphological characters have been the
              basis of traditional classification in the group, they are
              relatively few in number. In addition, our current understanding
              of skeletal growth and homology is limited, and homoplasy is
              rampant, limiting the usefulness of morphological phylogenetics.
              Molecular phylogenetic hypotheses for the order, which have been
              primarily focused on reef-building corals, differ significantly
              from traditional classification. They suggest that the group is
              represented by two major lineages and do not support the
              monophyly of traditional suborders and most traditional families.
              It appears that once a substantial number of azooxanthellate taxa
              are included in molecular phylogenetic analyses, basal
              relationships within the group will be clearly defined.
              Understanding of relationships at lower taxonomic levels will be

              metabolism. First, the contribution of protein anabolism to
              respiratory costs under high pCO2 was evaluated by measuring the
              aerobic respiration of S. caliendrum recruits with and without
              the protein synthesis inhibitor emetine following 1 to 4 days at
              45 Pa versus 77 Pa pCO2. Second, protein catabolism under high
              pCO2 was evaluated by measuring the flux of ammonium (NH4+) from
              juvenile colonies of S. caliendrum incubated in darkness at 47 Pa
              and 90 Pa pCO2. Two days after settlement, respiration of
              recruits was affected by an interaction between emetine and pCO2,
              with emetine reducing respiration 63\% at 45 Pa pCO2 and 27\% at

              when respiration was reduced 27\% by emetine under both pCO2

              accounted for a large proportion of metabolic costs in coral
              recruits and was affected by high pCO2, with consequences
              detected in aerobic respiration. Juvenile S. caliendrum showed
              net uptake of NH4+ at 45 Pa pCO2 but net release of NH4+ at 90 Pa

              Calcite crystals therefore may occur, obstruct pancreatic ducts,

              synthesized by the pancreas, inhibits the growth of calcite
              crystals by inducing a habit modification: the rhombohedral \{10
              1̄4\} usual habit is transformed into a needle-like habit through
              the \{112̄0\} crystal form. A similar observation was made with
              the N-terminal undecapeptide (pE1R11) of lithostathine. We
              therefore aimed at discovering how peptides inhibit calcium salt

              lithostathine, including the flexible N-terminal domain, at 1.3

              chains of amino acids made hydrogen bonds with the calcite
              surface. Last, electrostatic bonds between calcium ions and
              peptide bonds stabilized and anchored pE1R11 on the crystal

              this natural approach for the display of signaling peptide
              sequences at biomineral surfaces. Salivary statherin contains a
              15-amino acid hydroxyapatite binding domain (N15) that is loosely

              active peptide sequences on hydroxyapatite, the RGD and flanking
              residues from osteopontin were fused to the C terminus. The
              fusion peptides bound tightly to hydroxyapatite, and the

              Mo$\alpha$v melanoma cells when immobilized on the hydroxyapatite

               are the main skeletal structures. They have been intensively
               studied for insight into the mechanisms of biomineralization.
               Recent work on characterization of the mineral phase and
               occluded proteins in embryonic skeletal spicules shows that
               these simple-looking structures contain scores of different
               proteins, and that the mineral phase is composed of amorphous
               calcium carbonate (ACC), which then transforms to an anhydrous
               ACC and eventually to calcite. Likewise, the adult tooth shows a

              levels in HEV, that encodes a secreted, acidic protein closely
              related to the anti-adhesive extracellular matrix protein known
              as BM-40, osteonectin, and SPARC (secreted protein acidic and
              rich in cysteine). Here, we show that this protein, designated
              hevin, is associated with basal, lateral, and apical surfaces of
              HEV cells, and unlike MECA-79 antigen, is not expressed on the
              underlying basement membrane. In contrast to fibronectin or other
              adhesive extracellular matrix proteins, purified hevin does not
              support endothelial cell adhesion in vitro. Moreover, addition of
              soluble exogenous hevin inhibits attachment and spreading of
              endothelial cells on fibronectin substrates. Hevin-treated cells
              do not form focal adhesions and exhibit a rounded morphology.
              Together, these results suggest that hevin is an abundant
              extracellular protein that modulates high endothelial cell
              adhesion to the basement membrane.",

              primary targets of metal toxicity are the processes downstream

              (6--48 h) and declined to basal levels within 72 h of thermal

              gene, with stimulated expression from 6 to 48 h of 34°C thermal

  abstract = "Elevated seawater temperatures are associated with coral
              bleaching events and related mortality. Nevertheless, some coral
              species are able to survive bleaching and recover. The apoptotic
              responses associated to this ability were studied over 3 years in
              the coral Stylophora pistillata from the Gulf of Eilat subjected
              to long term thermal stress. These include caspase activity and
              the expression profiles of the S. pistillata caspase and Bcl-2
              genes (StyCasp and StyBcl-2-like) cloned in this study. In corals
              exposed to thermal stress (32 or 34°C), caspase activity and the
              expression levels of the StyBcl-2-like gene increased over time
              (6--48 h) and declined to basal levels within 72 h of thermal
              stress. Distinct transcript levels were obtained for the StyCasp
              gene, with stimulated expression from 6 to 48 h of 34°C thermal
              stress, coinciding with the onset of bleaching. Increased cell
              death was detected in situ only between 6 to 48 h of stress and
              was limited to the gastroderm. The bleached corals survived up to
              one month at 32°C, and recovered back symbionts when placed at
              24°C. These results point to a two-stage response in corals that
              withstand thermal stress: (i) the onset of apoptosis, accompanied
              by rapid activation of anti-oxidant/anti-apoptotic mediators that
              block the progression of apoptosis to other cells and (ii)
              acclimatization of the coral to the chronic thermal stress
              alongside the completion of symbiosis breakdown. Accordingly, the
              coral's ability to rapidly curb apoptosis appears to be the most
              important trait affecting the coral's thermotolerance and
              survival.",

              anemones and reef building corals. Like all organisms, cnidarians
              must maintain pH homeostasis to counterbalance reduction in
              intracellular pH, which can arise due to changes in either
              intrinsic or extrinsic parameters. Corals and sea anemones face
              natural daily changes in internal fluids where extracellular pH
              can range from 8.9 during the day to 7.4 at night. Furthermore,
              cnidarians are likely to experience future CO2-driven declines in
              seawater pH, a process known as ocean acidification. Here, we
              carried out the first mechanistic investigation to determine how
              cnidarian pHi responds to decreases in extracellular and
              intracellular pH. Using the anemone Anemonia viridis, we employed
              confocal live cell imaging and a pH-sensitive dye to track the
              dynamics of pHi after intracellular acidosis induced by acute
              exposure to decreases in seawater pH and NH4Cl prepulses. The

              have broadened our understanding of coral biology, but a study of
              the microRNA (miRNA) repertoire of corals is missing. miRNAs

              processing and function. Based on small RNA sequencing, we

              ancestral mucin to a new function, the regulation of the
              mineralization process, may be one of the molecular events, among
              others, that would explain the simultaneous emergence of

              reefs: laboratory evidence and CO2 seep research has shown
              adverse effects on many coral species, although a few are
              resilient. There are concerns that cold-water corals are even
              more vulnerable as they live in areas where aragonite saturation
              ($\Omega$ara) is lower than in the tropics and is falling rapidly
              due to CO2 emissions. Here, we provide laboratory evidence that
              net (gross calcification minus dissolution) and gross
              calcification rates of three common cold-water corals,
              Caryophyllia smithii, Dendrophyllia cornigera and Desmophyllum
              dianthus, are not affected by pCO2 levels expected for 2100 (pCO2
              1058 $\mu$atm, $\Omega$ara 1.29), and nor are the rates of
              skeletal dissolution in D. dianthus. We transplanted D. dianthus
              to 350 m depth (pHT 8.02; pCO2 448 $\mu$atm, $\Omega$ara 2.58)
              and to a 3 m depth CO2 seep in oligotrophic waters (pHT 7.35;
              pCO2 2879 $\mu$atm, $\Omega$ara 0.76) and found that the
              transplants calcified at the same rates regardless of the pCO2
              confirming their resilience to acidification, but at
              significantly lower rates than corals that were fed in aquaria.
              Our combination of field and laboratory evidence suggests that
              ocean acidification will not disrupt cold-water coral
              calcification although falling aragonite levels may affect other

              activities can result in a range of impacts on reef building
              corals that include coral bleaching (reduced concentrations of
              algal symbionts), decreased coral growth and calcification, and
              increased incidence of diseases and mortality. Understanding how
              elevated temperatures and nutrient concentration affect early
              transcriptional changes in corals and their algal endosymbionts
              is critically important for evaluating the responses of coral
              reefs to global changes happening in the environment. Here, we
              investigated the expression of genes in colonies of the
              reef-building coral Acropora aspera exposed to short-term
              sub-lethal levels of thermal (+6[degree sign]C) and nutrient
              stress (ammonium-enrichment: 20 muM).RESULTS:The RNA-Seq data
              provided hundreds of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
              corresponding to various stress regimes, with 115 up- and 78
              down-regulated genes common to all stress regimes. A list of DEGs
              included up-regulated coral genes like cytochrome c oxidase and
              NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase and up-regulated photosynthetic
              genes of algal origin, whereas coral GFP-like fluorescent
              chromoprotein and sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase showed
              reduced transcript levels. Taxonomic analyses of the coral
              holobiont disclosed the dominant presence of transcripts from
              coral (~70\%) and Symbiodinium (~10-12\%), as well as ~15-20\% of
              unknown sequences which lacked sequence identity to known genes.
              Gene ontology analyses revealed enriched pathways, which led to
              changes in the dynamics of protein networks affecting growth,
              cellular processes, and energy requirement.CONCLUSIONS:In corals
              with preserved symbiont physiological performance (based on
              Fv/Fm, photo-pigment and symbiont density), transcriptomic
              changes and DEGs provided important insight into early stages of
              the stress response in the coral holobiont. Although there were
              no signs of coral bleaching after exposure to short-term thermal
              and nutrient stress conditions, we managed to detect oxidative
              stress and apoptotic changes on a molecular level and provide a
              list of prospective stress biomarkers for both partners in
              symbiosis. Consequently, our findings are important for
              understanding and anticipating impacts of anthropogenic global

              critical for cell adhesion through $\alpha$v-containing
              integrins. In close proximity to the RGD domain is the thrombin

              cleavage of osteopontin occurs in vivo and may be physiologically
              important. To study the functional significance of osteopontin
              cleavage by thrombin, we made glutathione
              S-transferase-osteopontin fusion proteins. These proteins contain
              either the N- or C-terminal domains expected to be formed
              following thrombin cleavage at the Arg169-Ser170 peptide bond. We

              sequence analysis showed the protein to consist of 134 amino
              acids and to contain three sequence repeats of ∼40 amino acids
              which were very similar to the well-known whey acidic protein
              domains of other proteins. The new protein was therefore named
              perlwapin. In addition to the major sequence, we identified
              several minor variants. Atomic force microscopy was used to
              explore the interaction of perlwapin with calcite crystals.
              Monomolecular layers of calcite crystals dissolve very slowly in
              deionized water and recrystallize in supersaturated calcium

              distinct step edges, preventing the crystal layers from growing.
              Using lower concentrations of perlwapin in a saturated calcium

              occurring within a developmental context. Here we investigate the

              the four dozen that constitute the protein matrix of the skeletal
              spicule. SM50 and SM30 have been studied in some detail, and
              polyclonal antisera have been prepared against them (C. E.
              Killian and F. H. Wilt, 1996, J. Biol. Chem. 271, 9150--9159).
              Using these antibodies we describe here the localization and time
              course of accumulation of these two proteins in
              Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, both in the intact embryo and in
              micromere cultures. We also investigate the disposition of the

              expression. It is unlikely that these proteins are solely

              role in defining the extracellular space in which spicule

              component of the skeleton comprises 0.01 to 0.1\% of the total
              weight and has 3 microscopic constituents: (1) filaments of
              lime-boring algae, (2) a dispersed network of fibres 1 \{micro\}
              in diameter, and (3) a transparent, milky, regionally
              birefringent matrix of chitin. The chitin was observed to be a
              spongework of fibrils of average diameter 20 m\{micro\}. The
              chitin fibrils were inferred to be randomly oriented in the plane
              of the skeletogenic epithelium perpendicular to the direction of
              growth of the long axes of the aragonite crystals.The development

              growing population needs increasing amounts of fish and other
              marine organisms. However, overfishing, destructive fishing
              methods and sedimentation have damaged or destroyed many reef

              of healthy reefs. The economic losses to the coastal fishing
              population are considerable. Various programmes have and are
              trying to counter coral reef decline by establishing sustainable
              management regimes. The economic benefits of such programmes
              appear to exceed their investment costs. As an example, the
              start-up and maintenance costs of a successful island marine
              reserve project have been compared to the losses caused by reef
              destruction and the gains from reef management. The results
              clearly show that the economic benefits from a managed reef area
              due to higher catches and revenue from small-scale tourism far
              exceed costs. Coral reefs are also a major attraction for an
              increasing number of local and international tourists. In
              addition to providing income for the tourism industry, these reef
              visitors are often willing to contribute to the costs for reef
              management. The annual willingness-to-pay assessed in three
              popular diving destinations are significant. An estimated US\$
              300 000 could be collected annually as entrance fees or donations

              reef in their degraded condition still contribute at least US\$
              1.35 billion annually to the economy. Reef management involving
              local fishing communities, local governments and other concerned
              organizations is a cost-effective way to alleviate the pressure
              on the numerous threatened coral reefs. In addition, economic

              grown under three different culture experiments composed of

              measured. The temperature dependent isotope fractionation of 0.02
              ‰/˚C deduced from this study is similar to inorganic aragonite,
              but the degree of isotope fractionation is about +0.4 ‰ offset in
              corals. These observations agree with earlier results on
              different coral species, suggesting Ca isotope fractionation
              during Ca transmembrane transport in corals. While in cultured
              corals a significant temperature dependence of $\delta$44Ca is
              observed, the relationships between calcium isotope fractionation
              and pH as well as light intensity are negligible. Therefore
              variation of $\delta$44Ca in Porites corals is mainly controlled
              by temperature. A combination of $\delta$44Ca and Sr/Ca of corals
              in temperature controlled experiments cannot be explained by
              Rayleigh type fractionation directly from a fluid, which is
              seawater-like in terms of $\delta$44Ca and Sr/Ca. Through

              $\delta$44Ca of scleractinian corals including previous studies

              important for better understanding biomineralisation in corals

              GRN model explains much of the specification in the endoderm and

              incomplete. Here, we characterize FoxN2/3 in the primary
              mesenchyme cell (PMC) GRN state. Expression of foxN2/3 mRNA
              begins in micromeres at the hatched blastula stage and then is
              lost from micromeres at the mesenchyme blastula stage. foxN2/3
              expression then shifts to the non-skeletogenic mesoderm and,
              later, to the endoderm. Here, we show that Pmar1, Ets1 and Tbr
              are necessary for activation of foxN2/3 in micromeres. The later
              endomesoderm expression of foxN2/3 is independent of the earlier
              expression of foxN2/3 in micromeres and is independent of signals
              from PMCs. FoxN2/3 is necessary for several steps in the
              formation of the larval skeleton. Early expression of genes for
              the skeletal matrix is dependent on FoxN2/3, but only until the

              between corals and their symbiotic algae are subject to

              varying N : P ratios, with nitrate or ammonium as a nitrogen
              source. We showed significant differences in the carbon
              acquisition by the symbionts and its allocation within the
              symbiosis according to nutrient abundance, type and
              stoichiometry. In particular, under low phosphate concentration
              (0.05 µM), a 3 µM nitrate enrichment induced a significant
              decrease in carbon fixation rate and low values of carbon
              translocation, compared with control conditions (N : P = 0.5 :
              0.05), while these processes were significantly enhanced when
              nitrate was replaced by ammonium. A combined enrichment in

              for producing such single crystals with aggregated particle
              texture are presented. Crystallization is achieved by a two-step
              reaction in which amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) is first
              precipitated and then transformed into calcite in small volumes
              of water and in the presence of additives. The additives used are
              gel-forming molecules, phosphate ions, and the organic extract
              from sea urchin embryonic spicules - all are present in various
              biogenic crystals that grow via the transformation of ACC.
              Remarkably, this procedure yields faceted single-crystals of

              predominantly by the accretion of ACC nanoparticles, which
              subsequently crystallize. Gels and phosphate ions stabilize ACC
              via a different mechanism than sea urchin spicule macromolecules.
              It is concluded that the unique nanoparticle texture of biogenic
              minerals results from formation pathways that may differ from one
              another, but given the appropriate precursor and

              potential to address a variety of questions ranging from
              developmental biology to biomineralization. The brachiopod shell
              is a composite material primarily composed of either calcite or
              calcium phosphate in close association with proteins and
              polysaccharides which give these composite structures their
              material properties. The information content of these

              describing how brachiopod shell formation evolved. Here, using
              high throughput proteomic approaches and next generation
              sequencing, we have surveyed and characterized the first

              metazoan biomineralization proteins, suggesting that some
              elements of the brachiopod shell-forming proteome are deeply

              at hour 24. This study suggested that declined pH and
              pH$\times$temperature interaction induced down regulation of

  abstract = "Calcium carbonate exists in two main forms, calcite and
              aragonite, in the skeletons of marine organisms. The primary
              mineralogy of marine carbonates has changed over the history of
              the earth depending on the magnesium/calcium ratio in seawater
              during the periods of the so-called ``calcite and aragonite
              seas.'' Organisms that prefer certain mineralogy appear to
              flourish when their preferred mineralogy is favored by seawater
              chemistry. However, this rule is not without exceptions. For
              example, some octocorals produce calcite despite living in an
              aragonite sea. Here, we address the unresolved question of how
              organisms such as soft corals are able to form calcitic skeletal
              elements in an aragonite sea. We show that an extracellular
              protein called ECMP-67 isolated from soft coral sclerites induces
              calcite formation in vitro even when the composition of the
              calcifying solution favors aragonite precipitation. Structural
              details of both the surface and the interior of single crystals
              generated upon interaction with ECMP-67 were analyzed with an
              apertureless-type near-field IR microscope with high spatial
              resolution. The results show that this protein is the main
              determining factor for driving the production of calcite instead
              of aragonite in the biocalcification process and that --OH,
              secondary structures (e.g. $\alpha$-helices and amides), and
              other necessary chemical groups are distributed over the center
              of the calcite crystals. Using an atomic force microscope, we
              also explored how this extracellular protein significantly
              affects the molecular-scale kinetics of crystal formation. We
              anticipate that a more thorough investigation of the
              proteinaceous skeleton content of different calcite-producing
              marine organisms will reveal similar components that determine
              the mineralogy of the organisms. These findings have significant

              the host organism. Scleractinian corals represent particularly
              provocative subjects for study in this context because they are
              morphologically complex and associate with a broad diversity of
              macro invertebrates and vertebrates as well as microorganisms.
              Representatives of all these taxonomic groupings have been shown
              to contribute to the function of corals through direct or
              indirect provisioning and cycling of nutrients, waste removal,
              defense, and stress tolerance, traits that influence the fitness
              and environmental thresholds of individual coral colonies. How
              the taxonomic composition, functional limits and interactive
              nature of members of these communities vary among and within host
              species, and scale up to influence community level processes that
              drive ecosystem structure and function through time and space is
              unknown; these communities are, however, taxonomically variable
              among individual corals. Here we draw on the published literature
              to discuss the ecological and functional significance of the
              broad and variable taxonomic symbioses found closely associated
              with corals. Using a comparative approach, we hypothesize that
              the intra-specific and inter-specific variations in response of
              corals to environmental disturbance is linked to differences in
              the specificity, nature and composition of these symbiotic
              assemblages and reflect variation in the architectural complexity
              (micro and macro) and capacity of corals to provision habitat. We
              describe individual coral colonies as symbiomes, unique
              micro-ecosystems bounded by the physical limits of the coral
              colony whose performance limits reflect the taxonomic range of
              the associates (micro and macro) found within the colony. We
              explicitly recognize the fact that corals represent complex
              ecological communities composed of organisms that have the
              potential to compete, as well as interact with one another and

              overcome this limitation, and was therefore optimized for a 40 cm
              deep sediment core sampled from a tidal sandy flat of the German
              Wadden Sea. Treatment with methanol and H2O2 inactivated
              endogenous peroxidases and effectively reduced the background
              signal. Percentage of DAPI stained cells detected with the probe
              combination EUB(I-III), targeting nearly all the Bacteria, were
              comparable for CARD--FISH with a horseradish peroxidase
              (HRP)-labeled probe and FISH with a fluorescently monolabeled
              probe in the 2--3 cm depth interval (92\% and 82\%,
              respectively), but significantly higher with the HRP-labeled
              probe at 35--40 cm, the deepest layer sampled (63\% with HRP vs.
              26\% with monolabeled probe). With CARD--FISH Alphaproteobacteria
              and the Desulfobulbaceae group of sulfate-reducing bacteria were
              detected only in the upper layers. In contrast,
              Desulfosarcinales, the Bacteroidetes group, Planctomycetes,
              Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria were found at all
              depths. Archaea were detectable with ARCH915-HRP after
              achromopeptidase treatment. Surprisingly, aggregates of Bacteria
              and Archaea were found, below 12 cm depth, that strongly resemble
              consortia involved in anoxic oxidation of methane that have
              previously been found in sediments near methane hydrate deposits.
              With the optimized CARD--FISH protocol, microbial populations
              could also be detected in deeper sediment horizons. Furthermore,
              the intensity of the CARD--FISH signals improved detection of
              rare organisms such as Archaea.",

  abstract = "Emerging diseases have been responsible for the death of about
              30\% of corals worldwide during the last 30 years. Coral
              biologists have predicted that by 2050 most of the world's coral
              reefs will be destroyed. This prediction is based on the
              assumption that corals can not adapt rapidly enough to
              environmental stress-related conditions and emerging diseases.
              Our recent studies of the Vibrio shiloi/Oculina patagonica model
              system of the coral bleaching disease indicate that corals can
              indeed adapt rapidly to changing environmental conditions by
              altering their population of symbiotic bacteria. These studies
              have led us to propose the Coral Probiotic Hypothesis. This
              hypothesis posits that a dynamic relationship exists between
              symbiotic microorganisms and environmental conditions which
              brings about the selection of the most advantageous coral
              holobiont. Changing their microbial partners would allow the
              corals to adapt to changing environmental conditions more rapidly
              (days to weeks) than via mutation and selection (many years). An
              important outcome of the Probiotic Hypothesis would be
              development of resistance of the coral holobiont to diseases. The
              following evidence supports this hypothesis: (i) Corals contain a
              large and diverse bacterial population associated with their
              mucus and tissues; (ii) the coral-associated bacterial population
              undergoes a rapid change when environmental conditions are
              altered; and (iii) although lacking an adaptive immune system (no
              antibodies), corals can develop resistance to pathogens. The
              Coral Probiotic Hypothesis may help explain the evolutionary
              success of corals and moderate the predictions of their demise.",

              are becoming more common on tropical reefs. Interactions between
              these macroalgae and corals may alter the coral microbiome, which
              is thought to play an important role in colony health and
              survival. Together, such changes in benthic macroalgae and in the
              coral microbiome may result in a feedback mechanism that
              contributes to additional coral cover loss. To determine if
              macroalgae alter the coral microbiome, we conducted a field-based
              experiment in which the coral Porites astreoides was placed in
              competition with five species of macroalgae. Macroalgal contact
              increased variance in the coral-associated microbial community,
              and two algal species significantly altered microbial community

              microbiome, and 4) vectoring and growth of microbial taxa from
              the macroalgae to the coral. Furthermore, macroalgal competition
              decreased coral growth rates by an average of 36.8\%. Overall,
              this study found that competition between corals and certain
              species of macroalgae leads to an altered coral microbiome,
              providing a potential mechanism by which macroalgae-coral

              zooxanthellae, endolithic algae and fungi, Bacteria,Archaea and

              and species-specific associations with corals. Other associations
              are less specific; coral-associated Archaea differ from those in
              the water column, but the same archaeal species may be found on
              different coral species. It has been hypothesized that the coral
              animal can adapt to differing ecological niches by `switching'
              its microbial associates. In the case of corals and
              zooxanthellae, this has been termed adaptive bleaching and it has
              important implications for carbon cycling within the coral
              holobiont and ultimately the survival of coral reefs. However,
              the roles of other components of the coral holobiont are
              essentially unknown. To better understand these other coral
              associates, a fractionation procedure was used to separate the
              microbes, mitochondria and viruses from the coral animal cells
              and zooxanthellae. The resulting metagenomic DNA was sequenced

              previously appreciated. In particular, the data suggested that
              endolithic fungi could be converting nitrate and nitrite to
              ammonia, which would enable fixed nitrogen to cycle within the
              coral holobiont. The most prominent bacterial groups were
              Proteobacteria (68\%), Firmicutes (10\%), Cyanobacteria (7\%) and
              Actinobacteria (6\%). Functionally, the bacterial community was
              primarily heterotrophic and included a number of pathways for the
              degradation of aromatic compounds, the most abundant being the
              homogentisate pathway. The most abundant phage family was the
              ssDNA Microphage and most of the eukaryotic viruses were most

              EST project on the anthozoan cnidarian, Acropora millepora, a
              basal metazoan. More than 10\% of the Acropora ESTs with strong

              Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis version 5 (MEGA5), which
              is a user-friendly software for mining online databases, building
              sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees, and using methods of
              evolutionary bioinformatics in basic biology, biomedicine, and
              evolution. The newest addition in MEGA5 is a collection of
              maximum likelihood (ML) analyses for inferring evolutionary
              trees, selecting best-fit substitution models (nucleotide or
              amino acid), inferring ancestral states and sequences (along with
              probabilities), and estimating evolutionary rates site-by-site.
              In computer simulation analyses, ML tree inference algorithms in
              MEGA5 compared favorably with other software packages in terms of
              computational efficiency and the accuracy of the estimates of
              phylogenetic trees, substitution parameters, and rate variation
              among sites. The MEGA user interface has now been enhanced to be
              activity driven to make it easier for the use of both beginners
              and experienced scientists. This version of MEGA is intended for
              the Windows platform, and it has been configured for effective
              use on Mac OS X and Linux desktops. It is available free of

              exchange has been assumed to be limited by molecular diffusion
              through an unstirred boundary layer extending 1--2 mm from the
              coral surface, with corals relying solely on external flow to
              overcome this limitation. Here, we present direct microscopic
              evidence that, instead, corals can actively enhance mass
              transport through strong vortical flows driven by motile
              epidermal cilia covering their entire surface. Ciliary beating
              produces quasi-steady arrays of counterrotating vortices that
              vigorously stir a layer of water extending up to 2 mm from the
              coral surface. We show that, under low ambient flow velocities,
              these vortices, rather than molecular diffusion, control the
              exchange of nutrients and oxygen between the coral and its
              environment, enhancing mass transfer rates by up to 400\%. This
              ability of corals to stir their boundary layer changes the way
              that we perceive the microenvironment of coral surfaces,
              revealing an active mechanism complementing the passive
              enhancement of transport by ambient flow. These findings extend
              our understanding of mass transport processes in reef corals and
              may shed new light on the evolutionary success of corals and

              golf ball coral Favia fragum for 8 days at 25°C in seawater with
              aragonite saturation states ranging from ambient ($\Omega$ =
              3.71) to strongly undersaturated ($\Omega$ = 0.22). Aragonite was
              accreted by all corals, even those reared in strongly
              undersaturated seawater. However, significant delays, in both the
              initiation of calcification and subsequent growth of the primary
              corallite, occurred in corals reared in treatment tanks relative
              to those grown at ambient conditions. In addition, we observed
              progressive changes in the size, shape, orientation, and
              composition of the aragonite crystals used to build the skeleton.
              With increasing acidification, densely packed bundles of fine
              aragonite needles gave way to a disordered aggregate of highly
              faceted rhombs. The Sr/Ca ratios of the crystals, measured by
              SIMS ion microprobe, increased by 13\%, and Mg/Ca ratios
              decreased by 45\%. By comparing these variations in elemental
              ratios with results from Rayleigh fractionation calculations, we
              show that the observed changes in crystal morphology and
              composition are consistent with a >80\% decrease in the amount of
              aragonite precipitated by the corals from each ``batch'' of
              calcifying fluid. This suggests that the saturation state of
              fluid within the isolated calcifying compartment, while
              maintained by the coral at levels well above that of the external
              seawater, decreased systematically and significantly as the
              saturation state of the external seawater decreased. The
              inability of the corals in acidified treatments to achieve the
              levels of calcifying fluid supersaturation that drive rapid
              crystal growth could reflect a limit in the amount of energy
              available for the proton pumping required for calcification. If
              so, then the future impact of ocean acidification on tropical
              coral ecosystems may depend on the ability of individuals or
              species to overcome this limitation and achieve the levels of

              and respiration were studied with Ca2+, pH and O-2 microsensors
              using the scleractinian coral Galaxea fascicularis. Gross
              photosynthesis (Pg), net photosynthesis (Pn) and dark respiration
              (DR) were measured on the surface of the coral. Light respiration
              (LR) was calculated from the difference between Pg and Pn. Pg was
              about seven times higher than Pn; thus, respiration consumes most
              of the O-2 produced by the algal symbiont's photosynthesis. The
              respiration rate in light was ca. 12 times higher than in the
              dark. The coupled Pg and LR caused an intense internal carbon and
              O-2 cycling. The resultant product of this cycle is metabolic
              energy (ATP). The measured ATP content was about 35\% higher in
              light-incubated colonies than in dark-incubated ones. Direct
              measurements of Ca2+ and pH were made on the outer surface of the
              polyp, inside its coelenteron and under the calicoblastic layer.
              The effects on Ca2+ and pH dynamics of switching on and off the
              light were followed in these three compartments. Ca2+
              concentrations decreased in light on the surface of the polyp and
              in the coelenteron. They increased when the light was switched
              off. The opposite effect was observed under the calicoblastic
              layer. In light, the level of Ca2+ was lower on the polyp surface
              than in the surrounding seawater, and even lower inside the
              coelenteron. The concentration of calcium under the calicoblastic
              layer was about 0.6 mM higher than in the surrounding seawater.
              Thus Ca2+ can diffuse from seawater to the coelenteron, but
              metabolic energy is needed for its transport across the
              calicoblastic layer to the skeleton. The pH under the
              calicoblastic layer was more alkaline compared with the polyp
              surface and inside the coelenteron. This rise in pH increased the
              supersaturation of aragonite from 3.2 in the dark to 25 in the
              light, and brought about more rapid precipitation of CaCO3. When
              ruthenium red was added, Ca2+ and pH dynamics were inhibited
              under the calicoblastic layer. Ruthenium red is a specific
              inhibitor of Ca-ATPase. The results indicated that Ca-ATPase
              transports Ca2+ across the calicoblastic layer to the skeleton in
              exchange for H+. Addition of dichlorophenyldimethylurea
              completely inhibited photosynthesis. The calcium dynamics under
              the calicoblastic layer continued; however, the process was less
              regular. Initial rates were maintained. We conclude that light
              and not energy generation triggers calcium uptake; however,
              energy is also needed.",

              ecosystems, despite being surrounded by ocean waters where
              nutrients are in short supply. Benthic dinitrogen (N2) fixation
              is a significant internal source of ``new'' nitrogen (N) in reef
              ecosystems, but related information appears to be sparse. Here,
              we review the current state (and gaps) of knowledge on N2
              fixation associated with coral reef organisms and their
              ecosystems. By summarizing the existing literature, we show that
              benthic N2 fixation is an omnipresent process in tropical reef
              environments. Highest N2 fixation rates are detected in
              reef-associated cyanobacterial mats and sea grass meadows,
              clearly showing the significance of these functional groups, if
              present, to the input of new N in reef ecosystems. Nonetheless,
              key benthic organisms such as hard corals also importantly
              contribute to benthic N2 fixation in the reef. Given the usually
              high coral coverage of healthy reef systems, these results
              indicate that benthic symbiotic associations may be more
              important than previously thought. In fact, mutualisms between
              carbon (C) and N2 fixers have likely evolved that may enable reef
              communities to mitigate N limitation. We then explore the
              potential effects of the increasing human interferences on the
              process of benthic reef N2 fixation via changes in diazotrophic
              populations, enzymatic activities, or availability of benthic
              substrates favorable to these microorganisms. Current knowledge
              indicates positive effects of ocean acidification, warming, and
              deoxygenation and negative effects of increased ultraviolet
              radiation on the amount of N fixed in coral reefs. Eutrophication
              may either boost or suppress N2 fixation, depending on the
              nutrient becoming limiting. As N2 fixation appears to play a
              fundamental role in nutrient-limited reef ecosystems, these
              assumptions need to be expanded and confirmed by future research
              efforts addressing the knowledge gaps identified in this review.",

              calcification, but when combined with a fixed carbon source
              (glucose or glycerol), calcification increased. Respiration rates
              increased in response to oxygen with greater increases when
              oxygen is combined with fixed carbon. ATP content was largely

              pressures and decreasing pH in the oceans. We elucidated the
              impacts of an 8-week acclimation period to four seawater pCO2
              treatments (39, 113, 243 and 405 Pa/385, 1,120, 2,400 and 4,000
              $\mu$atm) on mantle gene expression patterns in the blue mussel
              Mytilus edulis from the Baltic Sea. Based on the M. edulis mantle
              tissue transcriptome, the expression of several genes involved in
              metabolism, calcification and stress responses was assessed in
              the outer (marginal and pallial zone) and the inner mantle
              tissues (central zone) using quantitative real-time PCR. The
              expression of genes involved in energy and protein metabolism
              (F-ATPase, hexokinase and elongation factor alpha) was strongly
              affected by acclimation to moderately elevated CO2 partial
              pressures. Expression of a chitinase, potentially important for
              the calcification process, was strongly depressed (maximum
              ninefold), correlating with a linear decrease in shell growth
              observed in the experimental animals. Interestingly, shell matrix
              protein candidate genes were less affected by CO2 in both
              tissues. A compensatory process toward enhanced shell protection
              is indicated by a massive increase in the expression of
              tyrosinase, a gene involved in periostracum formation (maximum
              220-fold). Using correlation matrices and a force-directed layout
              network graph, we were able to uncover possible underlying
              regulatory networks and the connections between different

              Petrography of the corals shows diagenetic features of
              dissolution, recrystallization, and secondary aragonite
              precipitation (pore filling), which are most extensive in the
              oldest part of the coral. Coral porewaters were extracted with a
              special setup and were analyzed for chemical composition. The
              total alkalinity and Sr deficit in pore water as compared to reef
              water is consistent with both precipitation of secondary
              aragonite and recrystallization of primary skeleton. The present
              rate constant of pore filling by secondary aragonite was
              estimated by a water replacement experiment to be 0.0015 y−1,
              which equals to pore filling rate of 1.5 $\pm$ 0.3 kg aragonite
              per year. The corals show clear seasonal fluctuations in Sr/Ca
              ratios that are interpreted as reflecting changes in sea surface
              temperature (SST). Yet, the secondary aragonite is characterized
              by a significantly higher Sr/Ca ratio than the average ratio in
              primary aragonite. Thus, measuring a mixed sample of pristine and
              secondary aragonite may produce erroneous (about 2°C lower) SST
              estimates by the Sr/Ca thermometers. It appears that the Sr/Ca
              ratio, a major proxy for paleo-environmental marine studies, is
              sensitive to subtle pore-filling and replacement of the original
              coral matrix by secondary aragonite in the marine environment.",

              (dissolution, secondary aragonite precipitation and pore filling)
              on the distribution of U in live and Holocene coral skeletons.
              For this, we drilled into large Porites lutea coral-heads growing
              in the Nature Reserve Reef (NRR), northern Gulf of Aqaba, a site
              close to the Marine Biology Laboratory, Elat, Israel, and sampled
              the core material and porewater from the drill-hole. In addition,
              we sampled Holocene corals and beachrock aragonite cements from a
              pit opened in a reef buried under the laboratory grounds. We
              measured the concentration and isotopic composition of U in the
              coral skeletal aragonite, aragonite cements, coral porewater and
              open NRR and Gulf of Aqaba waters. Uranium concentration in
              secondary aragonite filling the skeletal pores is significantly
              higher than in primary biogenic aragonite (17.3 $\pm$ 0.6
              compared to 11.9 $\pm$ 0.3 nmol · g−1, respectively). This
              concentration difference reflects the closed system incorporation
              of uranyl tri-carbonate into biogenic aragonite with a U/Ca bulk
              distribution coefficient (KD) of unity, versus the open system
              incorporation into secondary aragonite with KD of 2.4. The
              implication of this result is that continuous precipitation of
              secondary aragonite over ∼1000 yr of reef submergence would
              reduce the coral porosity by 5\% and can produce an apparent
              lowering of the calculated U/Ca - SST by ∼1°C and apparent age
              rejuvenation effect of 7\%, with no measurable effect on the
              calculated initial U isotopic composition. All modern and some
              Holocene corals (with and without aragonite cement) from Elat
              yielded uniform $\delta$234U = 144 $\pm$ 5, similar to the Gulf
              of Aqaba and modern ocean values. Elevated $\delta$234U values of
              ∼180 were measured only in mid-Holocene corals (∼5000 yr) from
              the buried reef. The values can reflect the interaction of the
              coral skeleton with 234U-enriched ground-seawater that washes the
              adjacent granitic basement rocks. We conclude that pore filling
              by secondary aragonite during reef submergence can produce small
              but measurable effects on the U/Ca thermometry and the U-Th ages.
              This emphasizes the critical importance of using pristine corals

  abstract = "Corals play a key role in ocean ecosystems and carbonate balance
              but their molecular response to ocean acidification remains
              unclear. The only previous whole transcriptome study (Moya et al.
              2012) documented extensive disruption of gene expression,
              particularly of genes encoding skeletal organic matrix proteins,
              in juvenile corals (A. millepora) after short-term (3 d) exposure
              to elevated pCO2. In the present study, whole transcriptome
              analysis was used to compare the effects of such ``acute'' (3 d)
              exposure to elevated pCO2 with a longer (``prolonged''; 9 d)
              period of exposure beginning immediately post-fertilisation. Far
              fewer genes were differentially expressed under the 9 d treatment
              and, although the transcriptome data implied wholesale disruption
              of metabolism and calcification genes in the acute treatment
              experiment, expression of most genes was at control levels after
              prolonged treatment. There was little overlap between the genes
              responding to the acute and prolonged treatments, but HSPs and
              HSFs were over-represented amongst the genes responding to both
              treatments. Amongst these was an HSP70 gene previously shown to
              be involved in acclimation to thermal stress in a field
              population of another acroporid coral. The most obvious feature
              of the molecular response in the 9 d treatment experiment was the
              up-regulation of five distinct Bcl-2 family members, the majority
              predicted to be anti-apoptotic. This suggests that an important
              component of the longer-term response to elevated CO2 is
              suppression of apoptosis. It therefore appears that juvenile A.
              millepora have the capacity to rapidly acclimate to elevated
              pCO2, a process mediated by up-regulation of specific HSPs and a
              suite of Bcl-2 family members. This article is protected by

  abstract = "The threat posed to coral reefs by changes in seawater pH and
              carbonate chemistry (ocean acidification) raises the need for a
              better mechanistic understanding of physiological processes
              linked to coral calcification. Current models of coral
              calcification argue that corals elevate extracellular pH under
              their calcifying tissue relative to seawater to promote skeleton
              formation, but pH measurements taken from the calcifying tissue
              of living, intact corals have not been achieved to date. We
              performed live tissue imaging of the reef coral Stylophora
              pistillata to determine extracellular pH under the calcifying
              tissue and intracellular pH in calicoblastic cells. We worked
              with actively calcifying corals under flowing seawater and show
              that extracellular pH (pHe) under the calicoblastic epithelium is
              elevated by ∼0.5 and ∼0.2 pH units relative to the surrounding
              seawater in light and dark conditions respectively. By contrast,
              the intracellular pH (pHi) of the calicoblastic epithelium
              remains stable in the light and dark. Estimates of aragonite
              saturation states derived from our data indicate the elevation in
              subcalicoblastic pHe favour calcification and may thus be a
              critical step in the calcification process. However, the observed
              close association of the calicoblastic epithelium with the
              underlying crystals suggests that the calicoblastic cells
              influence the growth of the coral skeleton by other processes in
              addition to pHe modification. The procedure used in the current
              study provides a novel, tangible approach for future
              investigations into these processes and the impact of
              environmental change on the cellular mechanisms underpinning

@ARTICLE{John2010-dj,
  title    = "Analysis of dissolved iron isotopes in seawater",
  author   = "John, Seth G and Adkins, Jess F",
  abstract = "Iron is an important nutrient in the ocean. Measuring the stable
              isotopes of dissolved Fe in seawater may help to answer important
              biogeochemical questions such as what are the sources and sinks
              for Fe to the oceans, and how is Fe biologically cycled. Because
              Fe concentrations in seawater are very low, typically less than
              1nM, there are significant challenges both to separate and purify
              Fe from seawater without introducing contamination, and to
              accurately analyze $\delta$56Fe on the small quantities of Fe
              extracted. New techniques are presented here for separation and
              purification of Fe from seawater by bulk extraction onto a resin
              with NTA functional groups, followed by anion exchange
              chromatography. This method recovers 89\% of the Fe from 1L
              samples of seawater without causing any fractionation of Fe
              isotopes, with a total blank of 1.1$\pm$0.6ng Fe. To optimize the
              analytical procedure for small amounts of Fe, the different
              sources of error in measurement of $\delta$56Fe have been
              analyzed. For 252 individual analyses of standards and samples,
              the internal error is well described by the combination of errors
              from electronic noise on the detectors (Johnson noise), counting
              statistics, and a third source of error hypothesized to be
              short-timescale flicker in instrumental mass bias. With the small
              amounts of iron found in natural seawater samples, error is
              dominated by Johnson noise and counting statistics. Our analyses
              also include 160 pairs of ``intermediate'' replicates in which
              the same post-purification sample was measured during different
              analytical sessions, and 141 pairs of ``external'' replicate
              analyses for samples prepared from the same original seawater
              carboy but which were extracted and purified separately. The
              portion of overall mass spectrometry error that derives from
              intermediate error has been evaluated by comparing the variance
              in $\delta$56Fe for a single sample measured during multiple
              analytical sessions with the internal variance in $\delta$56Fe
              for the multiple cycles of data that make up each single
              analysis. The portion of total external error that derives from
              internal error was determined from variance in $\delta$56Fe for
              external replicates, compared with internal error based on the
              variance in cycles for each single analysis. We find that the
              error for multiple analyses of a sample during different
              analytical sessions is 1.06 times the internal error, and the
              external error for analysis of Fe samples which have been
              separately purified and extracted from the same original seawater
              is 1.26 times the internal analytical error. Based on this error
              analysis, we suggest that dissolved Fe isotopes in seawater are
              best measured by separately extracting the Fe from a single liter
              of seawater and measuring the entire quantity of extracted Fe in
              a single short analysis. Using this method, the predicted
              accuracy for measurements of seawater dissolved $\delta$56Fe
              ranges from 0.2‰ to 0.05‰ (2$\sigma$) for seawater Fe
              concentrations of 0.1nM and 1.0nM, respectively.",

              related to global issues, such as marine ecology, climate change,
              paleoclimatogy, and metazoan evolution, very little is known
              about the evolutionary origin of coral skeleton formation. In
              order to investigate the evolution of coral biomineralization, we
              have identified skeletal organic matrix proteins (SOMPs) in the
              skeletal proteome of the scleractinian coral, Acropora
              digitifera, for which large genomic and transcriptomic datasets
              are available. Scrupulous gene annotation was conducted based on
              comparisons of functional domain structures among metazoans. We
              found that SOMPs include not only coral-specific proteins, but
              also protein families that are widely conserved among cnidarians
              and other metazoans. We also identified several conserved
              transmembrane proteins in the skeletal proteome. Gene expression
              analysis revealed that expression of these conserved genes
              continues throughout development. Therefore, these genes are
              involved not only skeleton formation, but also in basic cellular
              functions, such as cell-cell interaction and signaling. On the
              other hand, genes encoding coral-specific proteins, including
              extracellular matrix domain-containing proteins, galaxins, and
              acidic proteins, were prominently expressed in post-settlement
              stages, indicating their role in skeleton formation. Taken
              together, the process of coral skeleton formation is hypothesized
              as: 1) formation of initial extracellular matrix between
              epithelial cells and substrate, employing pre-existing
              transmembrane proteins; 2) additional extracellular matrix
              formation using novel proteins that have emerged by domain
              shuffling and rapid molecular evolution and; 3) calcification
              controlled by coral-specific SOMPs.",

              amino acid content of the four taxa to a residual level, assumed
              to represent the intra-crystalline fraction. When heated in water
              at 140 1C for 24 h, only 1\% of amino acids were leached from the

              functions and time-lagged cross-correlation methods. All four
              variables exhibit distinct seasonal variations, whose spatial

              commonly suboxic ([O2] 3 mM), with only brief periods of
              ventilation. Associated with development of suboxia, the
              concentration of nitrate decreases with depth into the basin
              without an associated decrease in phosphate, indicating that a
              substantial fraction of the nitrate supplied to the basin is
              removed by denitrification. Coincident with the decrease in
              nitrate concentration across the ``redoxcline'' (the interface
              between oxic and suboxic waters) within the SBB, there is an
              increase in the 15N/14N of that nitrate, as would be anticipated
              from the isotopic fractionation associated with denitrification.
              However, the increase in 15N/14N of nitrate is much smaller than
              occurs in the open eastern tropical North Pacific (ETNP) for a
              comparable amount of nitrate loss. Both the concentrations of N
              species within the basin and measurements of nitrate 18O/16O
              suggest that the lower- than-expected 15N enrichment in the
              suboxic SBB involves denitrification, rather than being due to
              some unknown source of low-15N/14N N to the deep SBB.
              Calculations with a range of models of nitrate supply and
              consumption indicate that the degree of nitrate consumption in
              the basin is too small for differences in water circulation to
              explain the isotopic differences between the Santa Barbara Basin
              and the open ETNP. Previous studies indicate that the isotope
              effect of sedimentary denitrification is negligible due to
              nitrate diffusion in sediment pore waters. Thus we infer that the
              small magnitude of the isotopic enrichment of SBB water column
              nitrate is due to the importance of sedimentary denitrification
              within the basin. Assuming that water column and sedimentary
              denitrification have isotope effects of 25 and 1.5 per mil,
              respectively, our results suggest that sedimentary
              denitrification accounts for more than 75\% of the nitrate loss
              within the suboxic SBB.",

              lution, little is known about the detailed mechanisms responsi-
              ble for calcite dissolution in seawater. In this paper, we
              dissolve 13C-labeled calcites in natural seawater. We show that
              the time- evolving enrichment of $\delta$13C in solution is a
              direct measure of both dissolution and precipitation reactions
              across a large range of saturation states. Secondary Ion Mass
              Spectrometer profiles into the 13C-labeled solids confirm the
              presence of precipitated material even in undersaturated
              conditions. The close balance of precipitation and dissolution
              near equilibrium can alter the chemical composition of calcite
              deeper than one monolayer into the crystal. This balance of
              dissolution--precipitation shifts signifi- cantly toward a
              dissolution-dominated mechanism below about $\Omega$ = 0.7.
              Finally, we show that the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA)
              increases the dissolution rate across all saturation states, and
              the effect is most pronounced close to equilibrium. This finding
              suggests that the rate of hydration of CO2 is a rate-limiting
              step for calcite dissolution in seawater. We then interpret our
              dissolu- tion data in a framework that incorporates both solution
              chem- istry and geometric constraints on the calcite solid. Near
              equilib- rium, this framework demonstrates a lowered free energy
              barrier at the solid--solution interface in the presence of CA.
              This frame- work also indicates a significant change in
              dissolution mechanism at $\Omega$ = 0.7, which we interpret as

              paid to tooth color, whose origin remains unknown. Based on
              recent studies, fluorophores---mainly aromatic amino acids (AAAs)
              in proteins---might be responsible for tooth color. We
              synthesized carbonated hydroxyapatite (HA; the mineral phase of
              teeth) in the presence of different amino acids (AAs; the basic
              units of protein matrix of teeth) as a simplified model of teeth
              to explore the color source at the AA level. After measuring the
              fluorescence and color characteristics of HA-AAs before and after
              bleaching treatment, we found that only HA, synthesized in the
              presence of AAAs, exhibited remarkable fluorescence and color
              property. Furthermore, linearly increased fluorescence intensity
              and deeper color were observed with an increase in AAA content in
              HA-AAAs. Similarly, significantly decreased absorbance of HA-AAAs
              between 250 and 300 nm in ultraviolet spectra, declined
              fluorescence intensity, and decolored performance of HA-AAAs were
              observed after bleaching treatment. The results showed that AAAs
              contributed to the fluorescence and color properties of HA and
              that hydrogen peroxide might whiten HA-AAAs by oxidizing the
              benzene ring in AAAs. These findings are of great significance in
              promoting the synthesis of advanced tooth-colored materials and
              furthering our understanding of the possible mechanisms of
              hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, our study shed light on the

               an intact eggshell and its antimicrobial defenses are essential
               to maintain this status during incubation. The absence of
               pathogens is a highly desirable property for unfertilized eggs
               in the food industry for human consumption. Still, the eggshell
               surface and internal egg contents can become contaminated with
               bacteria. The most prevalent bacteria associated with eggs and
               that are known to cause food related diseases in humans are
               Salmonella spp., Listeria spp., Staphylococcus spp., Bacillus
               spp., Campylobacter spp., and Escherichia spp. Bacterial
               contamination of the egg can arise via vertical or horizontal
               transmission. Vertical transmission pertains to an egg that is
               contaminated by bacteria prior to the laying of the egg (Cox et
               al., 2000). This is a major concern in the poultry industry, as
               infected hens do not always exhibit symptoms of infection.
               Consequently, the detection of birds laying contaminated eggs
               becomes very dif cult (Cox et al., 2000). The contamination of
               the egg after it has been expulsed from the hen is termed
               horizontal transmission, with bacteria originating from the
               nesting environment, hen feces, or food-processing environment

              priori knowledge of exon sequences from an annotated genome

              cDNA probes from expressed mRNA, which is then used to enrich and
              capture genomic DNA for expressed exon sequences. The new method
              eliminates the need for previous bioinformatic analysis and

              accuracy of EecSeq in the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica
              using a controlled exposure experiment. Four adult eastern
              oysters were heat shocked at 36° C for 1 hour along with four
              control oysters kept at ambient temperature (20° C). Stranded
              mRNA libraries were prepared for two exposed and two control
              individuals and pooled. Half of the combined library was used for
              probe synthesis and half of the combined library was sequenced to
              evaluate the efficiency of capture. Genomic DNA was extracted
              from all eight individuals, enriched via captured probes, and
              sequenced directly. We found that EecSeq had an average capture
              sensitivity of 86.8\% across all known exons and had over 99.4\%
              sensitivity for expressed exons (i.e. exons with detectable
              levels of expression in the mRNA library). For all mapped reads,
              over 47.9\% mapped to exons and 37.0\% mapped to expressed
              targets, which is similar to the success of capture in other
              species where probes were designed from genomic resources. Unlike
              other exome capture techniques, however, EecSeq displayed
              relatively even coverage within exons (i.e. little to no ``edge
              effects'') and coverage uniformly distributed across exon GC
              content. Across six replicate pools of eight individuals, 5,951
              SNPs with a minimum average coverage of 80X were discovered, with
              3,508 SNPs appearing in exonic regions. We show that EecSeq

              analysis of the entire fibril of Type I collagen including
              intra-fibrillar water distribution. We found that the ideal

              earliest nucleation occurs, but is severely distorted in areas
              that mineralize later. In detail, the ideal pseudohexagonal
              structure is well-preserved in the overlap zone (c1, c2 and b
              bands), in the a bands of the hole zone but is severely distorted

              1.5 nm height along the a-axis and width of 40 nm along the
              c-axis is not formed. The expected uniform channel of 1.5 nm
              height is preserved only in the a bands in a narrow sub-channel
              region only 5.8 nm wide. At the hole/overlap transition, an
              irregular, tortuous sub-channel of widely varying dimensions
              (B1.8--4.0 nm height B3.0 nm width) is formed. The well-defined
              sub-channel in the a bands along with their preferred orientation
              of charged amino acid residues could facilitate faster molecular
              diffusion than the tortuous sub-channels and ionic interactions,
              thus providing the first nucleation sites. Intra-fibrillar water
              occupies nano-spaces and shows low density (B0.7 g cm 3), which

               metazoans. Here we describe the substrate growth dynamics, mode
               of biomineralization and possible affinity of Namapoikia
               rietoogensis, a large (up to 1 m), robustly skeletal, and
               modular Ediacaran metazoan which encrusted the walls of
               synsedimentary fis- sures within microbial--metazoan reefs.
               Namapoikia formed laminar or domal morphologies with an internal
               structure of open tubules and transverse elements, and had a
               very plastic, non-deterministic growth form which could encrust
               both fully lithified surfaces as well as living microbial
               substrates, the latter via modified skeletal holdfasts.
               Namapoikia shows complex growth inter- actions and substrate
               competition with contemporary living microbialites and
               thrombolites, including the production of plate-like
               dissepiments in response to microbial overgrowth which served to
               elevate soft tissue above the microbial surface. Namapoikia
               could also recover from partial mortality due to microbial
               fouling. We infer initial skeletal growth to have propagated via
               the rapid for- mation of an organic scaffold via a basal
               pinacoderm prior to calcification. This is likely an ancient
               mode of biomineralization with similarities to the living
               calcified demosponge Vaceletia. Namapoikia also shows inferred
               skeletal growth banding which, combined with its large size,
               implies notable individ- ual longevity. In sum, Namapoikia was a
               large, relatively long-lived Ediacaran clonal skeletal metazoan
               that propagated via an organic scaffold prior to calci-
               fication, enabling rapid, effective and dynamic substrate
               occupation and competition in cryptic reef settings. The open

              concentrate exclusively on the ecological dimensions of local
              knowledge at the expense of other domains such as those
              associated with political or cultural identity. This thesis
              quantitatively evaluates the local knowledge of small-scale
              fishers in Moorea, French Polynesia, using distinct metrics in
              order to assess two of its domains, local ecological knowledge
              and local political knowledge. To gauge ecological knowledge, the
              results of a lagoon fish habitat ranking exercise completed by
              fishers (n=56) are compared with data from commonly cited marine
              science literature. Individual variation in political knowledge
              is measured by assessing fishers' (n=94) familiarity with a
              Moorean lunar calendar, known as a tarena, which is an important
              symbol of Polynesian identity and resistance to French
              colonialism. Results indicate that ecological knowledge is
              negatively associated with level of income. Familiarity with the
              tarena is negatively associated with increased exposure to formal
              education and positively associated with selective spearfishing.
              Women also tend to have more familiarity with the calendar than

              supply between Sr2+ and Ca2+. In addition, calcite productivity

              amphioxus homeobox genes comprise 60 ANTP class genes, 29 PRD

              diverse in amphioxus than humans, as a result of gene duplication
              on the vertebrate lineage. Amphioxus possesses at least one
              member for all of the 96 homeobox gene families inferred to be
              present in the common ancestor of chordates, including
              representa- tives of the Msxlx, Bari, Abox, Nk7, Ro, and Repo

              aquatic ecosystems today, the criteria used to identify them in
              the geological record are subjective and rarely testable.
              Differences in the mode of biomineralization between
              cyanobacteria and eukaryotes, i.e., biologically induced
              calcification (BIM) vs. biologically controlled calcification
              (BCM), result in different crystallographic structures which
              might be used as a criterion to test cyanobacterial affinities.
              Cyanobacteria are often used as a ``wastebasket taxon,'' to which
              various microfossils are assigned. The lack of a testable
              criterion for the identification of cyanobacteria may bias their
              fossil record severely. We employed electron backscatter
              diffraction (EBSD) to investigate the structure of calcareous
              skeletons in two microproblematica widespread in Palaeozoic
              marine ecosystems: Rothpletzella, hypothesized to be a
              cyanobacterium, and an incertae sedis microorganism Allonema. We
              used a calcareous trilobite shell as a BCM reference. The
              mineralized structure of Allonema has a simple single-layered
              structure of acicular crystals perpendicular to the surface of
              the organism. The c-axes of these crystals are parallel to the
              elongation and thereby normal to the surface of the organism.
              EBSD pole figures and misorientation axes distribution reveal a
              fiber texture around the c-axis with a small degree of variation
              (up to 30◦), indicating a highly ordered structure. A comparable
              pattern was found in the trilobite shell. This structure allows
              excluding biologically induced mineralization as the mechanism of
              shell formation in Allonema. In Rothpletzella, the c-axes of the
              microcrystalline sheath show a broader clustering compared to
              Allonema, but still reveal crystals tending to be perpendicular
              to the surface of the organism. The misorientation axes of
              adjacent crystals show an approximately random distribution.
              Rothpletzella also shares morphological similarities with extant
              cyanobacteria. We propose that the occurrence of a strong
              misorientation relationship between adjacent crystals with
              misorientation axes clustering around the c-axis can be used as a
              proxy for the degree of control exerted by an organism on its
              mineralized structures. Therefore, precisely constrained
              distributions of misorientations (misorientation angle and
              misorientation axis) may be used to identify BCM in otherwise
              problematic fossils and can be used to ground-truth the
              cyanobacterial affinities commonly proposed for problematic
              extinct organisms.",

              complexity and the relative protein abundances to improve our
              understanding of survival mechanisms. The results show that
              although protein abundance is not necessarily di- rectly related

              whose genomic organization reflects their central roles in

              a cluster of Hox genes was pres- ent in the bilaterian common
              ancestor, the origins of this system remain unclear (cf. [8]).
              With new data for two representatives of the closest extant
              phylum to the Bilateria, the sea anemone Nematostella and the
              hydromedusa Eleutheria, we argue here that the Cni- daria predate
              the evolution of the Hox system. Al- though Hox-like genes are
              present in a range of cnidar- ians, many of these are paralogs
              and in neither Nematostella nor Eleutheria is an equivalent of
              the Hox cluster present. With the exception of indepen- dently
              duplicated genes, the cnidarian genes are un- linked and in
              several cases are flanked by non-Hox genes. Furthermore, the
              cnidarian genes are ex- pressed in patterns that are inconsistent
              with the Hox paradigm. We conclude that the Cnidaria/Bilateria

              spectacular variety in morphological and developmental
              characteristics shown by extant cni- darians demonstrates that
              there is no obligate link be- tween the Hox system and

              few polyps at 9°C strobilated, and temperature effects on budding
              were consistent with published results, we did not analyze data

              isotopic composition (18O) was analyzed at the micrometer scale.
              Measurements were collected from six cultured colonies using a
              factorial design of three temperatures (22°C, 25°C, and 28°C) and
              two light intensities (200 and 400 mol photon m−2 s−1).
              Observation of the newly formed skeletons revealed fibrous
              morphology. The 18O distribution following a bin width of 0.25‰
              in histograms was bimodal. Because the colonies were cultured
              under constant environmental conditions, we suggest this
              bimodality in isotope distribution was caused by the diurnal
              cycle of 12h light and 12h dark that is necessary for coral
              health and to mimic natural conditions. We assume that the two
              modal values correspond to the two fractionation end members
              present in daytime and nighttime fibers. Then, we investigated
              the precipitation mechanism for each. In contrast to a common
              assumption, that the two fractionations are due to differences in
              pH created by more or less efficient Ca2+ pumping, we demonstrate

              d13C in a range of values that are depleted from inorganic
              calcite/aragonite. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain
              this correlation, one based on kinetic isotope effects during
              CO2(aq)-HCO 3 inter-conversion, the other based on equilibrium
              isotope exchange during pH dependent speciation of the dissolved
              inorganic carbon (DIC) pool. Neither mech- anism explains all the
              stable isotope features observed in biogenic carbonates. Here we
              present a fully kinetic model of biomin- eralization and its
              isotope effects using deep-sea corals as a test organism. A key
              component of our model is the consideration of the enzyme
              carbonic anhydrase in catalyzing the CO2(aq)-HCO 3
              inter-conversion reactions in the extracellular calcifying fluid
              (ECF). We find that the amount of carbonic anhydrase not only
              modulates the carbonate chemistry of the calcifying fluid, but
              also helps explain the slope of the d18O-d13C correlation.
              Differences in CA activity in the biomineralization process can
              possibly explain the observed range of d18O-d13C slopes in
              different calcifying organisms. A mechanistic understanding of
              stable isotope vital effects with numerical models can help us
              develop better paleoceanographic tracers.",

              The SMB water column was divided into four depth-dependent

              We propose that distinct physical controls on methane dynamics

  abstract = "As the oceans become less alkaline due to rising CO2 levels,
              deleterious consequences are expected for calcifying corals.
              Predicting how coral calcification will be affected by on-going
              ocean acidification (OA) requires an accurate assessment of CaCO3
              deposition and an understanding of the relative importance that
              decreasing calcification and/or increasing dissolution play for
              the overall calcification budget of individual corals. Here, we
              assessed the compatibility of the 45Ca-uptake and total
              alkalinity (TA) anomaly techniques as measures of gross and net
              calcification (GC, NC), respectively, to determine coral
              calcification at pHT 8.1 and 7.5. Considering the differing
              buffering capacity of seawater at both pH values, we were also
              interested in how strongly coral calcification alters the
              seawater carbonate chemistry under prolonged incubation in sealed
              chambers, potentially interfering with physiological functioning.
              Our data indicate that NC estimates by TA are erroneously ∼5\%
              and ∼21\% higher than GC estimates from 45Ca for ambient and
              reduced pH, respectively. Considering also previous data, we show
              that the consistent discrepancy between both techniques across
              studies is not constant, but largely depends on the absolute
              value of CaCO3 deposition. Deriving rates of coral dissolution
              from the difference between NC and GC was not possible and we
              advocate a more direct approach for the future by simultaneously
              measuring skeletal calcium influx and efflux. Substantial changes
              in carbonate system parameters for incubation times beyond two
              hours in our experiment demonstrate the necessity to test and

              on the following series of diagenetic reactions and processes
              involving amino acids: the hydrolysis of proteins and the
              subsequent loss of hydrolysis products from the fossil matrix
              with increasing geologic age; the racemization of amino acids
              which produces totally racemized amino acids in 105^106 years in
              most environments on the Earth; the introduction of contaminants
              into the fossil that lowers the enantiomeric (D:L) ratios
              produced via racemization; and the condensation reactions between
              amino acids, as well as other compounds with primary amino
              groups, and sugars which yield humic acid-like polymers. This
              model was used to evaluate whether useful amino acid and DNA

              remains of evolutionary interest with respect to the origin of
              modern humans are unlikely to preserve useful biomolecular
              information although those from high latitude sites may be an
              exception. Amber-entombed insects contain well-preserved
              unracemized amino acids, apparently because of the anhydrous
              nature of the amber matrix, and thus may contain DNA fragments
              which have retained meaningful genetic information. Dinosaur

              organelles of Hydra, jellyfish, corals and other Cnidaria.
              Biogenesis of these organelles is complex and involves assembly
              of proteins inside a post-Golgi vesicle to form a double-layered
              capsule with a long tubule. Nowa is the major component of the
              outer wall, which is formed very early in morphogenesis. The high
              molecular weight glycoprotein has a modular structure with an
              N-terminal sperm coating glycoprotein domain, a central C-type
              lectin- like domain, and an eightfold repeated cysteine-rich
              domain at the C-terminus. Interestingly, the cysteine-rich
              domains are homologous to the cysteine-rich domains of
              minicollagens. We have previously shown that the cysteines of
              these minicollagen cysteine-rich domains undergo an isomerization
              process from intra- to intermolecular disulfide bonds, which
              mediates the crosslinking of minicollagens to networks in the

              present in both proteins provide a potential link between Nowa in
              the outer wall and minicollagens in the inner wall. We propose a

  abstract = "Over the last decade, technological advancements have
              substantially decreased the cost and time of obtaining large
              amounts of sequencing data. Paired with the exponentially
              increased computing power, individual labs are now able to
              sequence genomes or transcriptomes to investigate biological
              questions of interest. This has led to a significant increase in
              available sequence data. Although the bulk of data published in
              articles are stored in public sequence databases, very often,
              only raw sequencing data are available; miscellaneous data such
              as assembled transcriptomes, genome annotations etc. are not
              easily obtainable through the same means. Here, we introduce our
              website (http://reefgenomics.org) that aims to centralize genomic
              and transcriptomic data from marine organisms. Besides providing
              convenient means to download sequences, we provide (where
              applicable) a genome browser to explore available genomic
              features, and a BLAST interface to search through the hosted
              sequences. Through the interface, multiple datasets can be
              queried simultaneously, allowing for the retrieval of matching
              sequences from organisms of interest. The minimalistic, no-frills
              interface reduces visual clutter, making it convenient for
              end-users to search and explore processed sequence data.",

  abstract = "Background: The study of ancient protein sequences is
              increasingly focused on the analysis of older samples, including
              those of ancient hominins. The analysis of such ancient proteomes
              thereby potentially suffers from ``cross-species proteomic
              effects'': the loss of peptide and protein identifications at
              increased evolutionary distances due to a larger number of
              protein sequence differences between the database sequence and
              the analyzed organism. Error-tolerant proteomic search algorithms
              should theoretically overcome this problem at both the peptide
              and protein level; however, this has not been demonstrated. If
              error-tolerant searches do not overcome the cross-species
              proteomic issue then there might be inherent biases in the
              identified proteomes. Here, a bioinformatics experiment is
              performed to test this using a set of modern human bone proteomes
              and three independent searches against sequence databases at
              increasing evolutionary distances: the human (0 Ma), chimpanzee
              (6-8 Ma) and orangutan (16-17 Ma) reference proteomes,
              respectively.",

  abstract = "Many proteomics studies are conducted in model organisms for
              which fully annotated, detailed, high quality proteomes are
              available. By contrast, many studies in ecology and evolution are
              conducted in species which lack high quality proteome data,
              limiting the perceived value of a proteomic approach for protein
              discovery and quantification. This is particularly true of
              rapidly evolving proteins in the reproductive system, such as
              those that have an immune function or are under sexual selection,
              and can compromise the potential for cross-species proteomics to
              yield confident identification. In this investigation we analysed
              the sperm proteome, from a range of ungulates and rodents, and
              explored the potential of routine proteomic workflows to yield
              characterisation and quantification in non-model organisms. We
              report that database searching is robust to cross-species
              matching for a mammalian core sperm proteome, comprising 623
              proteins that were common to most of the 19 species studied here,
              suggesting that these proteins are likely to be present and
              identifiable across many mammalian sperm. Further, label-free
              quantification reveals a consistent pattern of expression level.
              Functional analysis of this core proteome suggests consistency
              with previous studies limited to model organisms and has value as
              a quantitative reference for analysis of species-specific protein

              in the ambient environment. We show, using a marine fish
              (Leiostomus xanthurus) reared in the laboratory under controlled
              experimental conditions, that otolith Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios are
              deposited in proportion to their respective ratios in ambient

              did not affect Ba incorporation in otoliths. Sr/Ca partition
              coefficients (DSr) were 0.182 and 0.205 at 20°C and 25°C,
              respectively. The partition coefficients for Ba/Ca were 0.055 at
              20°C and 0.062 at 25°C. A nonlinearity in the relationship
              between DBa and ambient Ba concentrations suggested that
              extrapolation beyond the Ba levels used in the experiment was not
              justified. On the basis of our results, it should be possible to
              reconstruct Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca levels in environments inhabited by
              fish based on otolith chemistry. Furthermore, Sr/Ca thermometry
              may also be possible using fish otoliths, but validation of the
              temperature dependence of Sr/Ca in otoliths will be required. We
              believe otoliths represent an excellent, and as yet underused,

              core at the center of their otolith, which corresponded to a
              period of their leptocephalus and early; glass eel stages in the

              Line analysis of Sr/Ca ratios along the radius of each otolith;
              showed peaks (ca 15; $\times$; 10; --3; ) between the core and
              out to about 150 $\mu$m (elver mark). The pattern; change of the
              Sr/Ca ratio outside of 150 $\mu$m indicated 3 general categories
              of migratory history: `river; eels`, `estuarine eels` and `sea
              eels`. These 3 categories corresponded to mean values of Sr/Ca
              ratios; of; $\geq$; 6.0; $\times$; 10; --3; for sea eels, which
              spent most of their life in the sea and did not enter freshwater,
              of 2.5; to 6.0; $\times$; 10; --3; for estuarine eels, which
              inhabited estuaries or switched between different habitats, and;
              of < 2.5; $\times$; 10; --3; for river eels, which entered and
              remained in freshwater river habitats after arrival in; the
              estuary. The occurrence of sea eels was 20 \% of all specimens
              examined and that of river eels,; 23 \%, while estuarine eels
              were the most prevalent (57 \%). The occurrence of sea eels was
              confirmed; at 4 localities in Japanese coastal waters, including
              offshore islands, a small bay and an estuary. The; finding of
              estuarine eels as an intermediate type, which appear to
              frequently move between different; habitats, and their presence
              at almost all localities, suggested that; A. japonica; has a
              flexible pattern; of migration, with an ability to adapt to
              various habitats and salinities. Thus, anguillid eel migrations;
              into freshwater are clearly not an obligatory migratory pathway,
              and this form of diadromy should be; defined as facultative
              catadromy, with the sea eel as one of several ecophenotypes.
              Furthermore, this; study indicates that eels which utilize the
              marine environment to various degrees during their juve-; nile
              growth phase may make a substantial contribution to the spawning
              stock each year."

              One of two batches of 2.5-yr-old fish raised in the laboratory
              were given a new food source with different $\delta$34S,
              $\delta$13C, and $\delta$15N, which were monitored in muscle and
              liver tissue for 1 yr. A model including change due to tissue
              accumulation (growth) and metabolic replacement was developed.
              For all three isotopes, most of the change could be attributed to
              growth. Metabolic replacement expressed as a turnover rate was
              only 0.1 −0.2\%∙d−1 and was similar for the three isotopes.
              Although liver tissue was −4.4 and −4.1‰, respectively, for
              $\delta$34S and $\delta$13C relative to muscle tissue, the
              response over time to the new food was the same as for muscle. We
              expect that the complete change in the isotope composition of

              ecosystems. There is a predictable positive relationship between
              the $\delta$15N values in tissue and trophic level, caused by the
              bioaccumulation of 15N in tissues of consumers with each step up

              perturbations such as overfishing or the damming of the Colorado

              encapsulated in ancient fish otoliths that are between 1,000 and
              5,500 years old to define the food web structure. Our results
              suggested that $\delta$15N in otoliths has slightly more positive
              $\delta$15N than soft tissue. The $\delta$15N values from ancient

              sculpin, C. aleuticus, in the Eel River drainage of California,
              to determine the processes allowing coexistence of these very
              similar fishes. We observed prickly sculpins at 43 sites and
              coastrange sculpins at 34. The species co-occurred at 26 sites.
              Young-of-year coastrange sculpins were only observed within 42 km
              of the ocean, but young-of-year prickly sculpins were present
              throughout the species range. Mean, maximum, and minimum lengths
              of coastrange sculpins were positively correlated with distance
              from the ocean but no significant relationships were found for
              prickly sculpins. Absolute abundance of both species was highest
              in mainstem habitat (prickly sculpins = 0.6 sculpins m−2 and
              coastrange sculpins = 0.4 sculpins m−2) . Tributary densities of
              both species tended to be less than 0.1 sculpins m−2. The species
              inhabited very similar habitats and had very similar diets.
              Coastrange sculpin populations in upstream areas were maintained
              by immigration from downstream areas in contrast with prickly
              sculpin populations that produced young-of-year fish throughout
              their range. Densities were probably not high enough for
              interspecific interactions to be important. The factors limiting
              the upstream distribution of the species may include high water
              temperatures, stability of the stream bed, and behavior of the
              fish. In the past, the range of sculpins within the Eel River
              drainage probably fluctuated with changing physical conditions.
              Recent introductions of exotic species that compete with and prey
              upon sculpins, and ongoing human activities in the drainage could
              result in major reductions in the distribution and abundance of

              used annually as nurseries by gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata
              L.) in the Gulf of Lions (NW Mediterranean). A series of nine
              elements were measured in otoliths of 301 S. aurata juveniles
              collected in the four lagoons in 2008, 2010 and 2011. Percentages
              of correct re-assignment of juveniles to their lagoon of origin
              were calculated with the Random Forest classification method,
              considering every possible combination of elements. This revealed
              both spatial and temporal variations in accuracy of habitat
              identification, with correct re-assignment to each lagoon ranging
              from 44 to 99\% depending on the year and the lagoon. There were
              also annual differences in the combination of elements that
              provided the best discrimination among the lagoons. Despite this,
              when the data from the three years were pooled, a combination of
              eight elements (B, Ba, Cu, Li, Mg, Rb, Sr and Y) provided greater
              than 70\% correct re-assignment to each single lagoon, with a
              multi-annual global accuracy of 79\%. When considering the years
              separately, discrimination accuracy with these elemental
              fingerprints was above 90\% for 2008 and 2010. It decreased to
              61\% in 2011, when unusually heavy rainfall occurred, which
              presumably reduced chemical differences among several of the
              lagoons. This study highlights the need for multi-annual
              sampling, and multi-elemental analysis, when developing otolith

              fish species, since all essential habitats must be protected to
              maintain sustainable stock levels. The present study used
              multi-element otolith fingerprints of the gilthead sea bream
              Sparus aurata (L.) to discriminate its main juvenile and adult
              habitats in the Languedoc-Roussillon region (Gulf of Lions,
              northwest Mediterranean) and infer the lifetime migrations of 12
              individuals from the area (11 from the present day and 1 from the
              Roman era). This allowed for the first time the identification of
              key habitats for the successful completion of the species' life
              cycle in the Gulf of Lions, and the connectivity between them.
              Our results revealed that lagoon use by S. aurata is probably
              ancient (>2500 yr) and confirmed its current commonness. Yet,
              although most observed migration patterns were in accordance with
              the migratory behavior previously described for the species,
              strong inter-individual variations and new patterns in habitat
              use were detected. At the juvenile stage, a preference for
              shallow lagoons with low salinities was evidenced. Nevertheless,
              the first year of life can also be successfully completed in
              marine conditions. At the adult stage, lagoon use was shown to
              occur until at least age 4 yr, with periods of lagoon residency
              of up to 11 mo in a year, often including winter months. Because
              overwintering in the lagoons was previously thought to be
              impossible for S. aurata due to low temperatures, this finding
              has important implications for future stock management,
              especially since the species breeds in winter.",

              (rainfall) or anthropogenic influences, the sandbar is breached,
              reopening the estuary to the ocean. The transition from closed to
              open state often leads to extensive physical and chemical changes
              in the estuarine conditions, as water mixing and sediment
              resuspension are increased, which could result in the oxidation
              of sediment acid-volatile sulfides (AVS). We followed monthly
              changes in water's and sediment geochemical characteristics at
              thirty-two sites spanning the Pescadero Estuary over a one-year
              period. We showed that the transition from closed to open state
              leads to significant decreases in aqueous pH to circumneutral
              values and significant increases in aqueous hydrogen sulfide and
              iron concentrations to 10.6$\mu$M and 59.1$\mu$M, respectively,

              Aqueous hydrogen sulfide concentrations observed in both closed

              thresholds for aquatic life. Moreover, mildly acidic water

              that some parts of the estuary were more vulnerable to decreased
              water quality. Indeed, high sediment AVS contents
              (19--24mmolkg−1) were observed year-round at the River Confluence
              and Butano Creek regions, which implies a high potential for

              diet-switch experiment and model fitting to quantify N stable
              isotope ($\delta$15N) turnover rates and discrimination factors
              for seven tissues: plasma, liver, fin, mucus, red blood cells,
              muscle, and scales. Among tissues, diet-tissue $\delta$15N
              discrimination factors ranged from 1.3 to 3.4 ‰. Model-supported
              tissue turnover half-lives ranged from 9.0 (fin) to 27.7 (scale)
              days. We evaluated six tissue turnover models using Akaike's
              information criterion corrected for small sample sizes. The use
              of equilibrium tissue values was supported in all tissues and
              two-compartment models were supported in plasma, liver, and
              mucus. Using parameter estimates and their uncertainty we
              developed stable isotope clocks to estimate the time since

              estimates of time since resource switch for durations
              approximately twice their half-life. Faster turnover tissues
              provided even higher precision estimates, but only within their
              half-life post-switch. Averaging estimates of time since resource
              shift from multiple tissues provided the highest precision
              estimates of time since resource shift for the longest duration
              (up to 64 days). This study therefore provides insight into
              physiological processes that underpin stable isotope patterns,
              explicitly tests alternative models, and quantifies key

              ecological responses (calcification) to these stressors are often
              contradicting. To detect underlying drivers of hetero- geneity in
              coral calcification responses, we developed a procedure for the
              inclusion of stress--effect relationships in ecological
              meta‐analyses. We applied this technique to a dataset of 294
              empirical observations from 62 peer‐reviewed publications test-
              ing individual and combined effects of elevated temperature and
              pCO2 on coral cal- cification. Our results show an additive
              interaction between warming and acidification, which reduces
              coral calcification by 20\% when pCO2 levels exceed 700 ppm and
              temperature increases by 3°C. However, stress levels varied among
              studies and significantly affected outcomes, with unaffected
              calcification rates under moderate stresses (pCO2 $\leq$ 700 ppm,
              $\Delta$T < 3°C). Future coral reef carbon budgets will therefore
              depend on the magnitude of pCO2 and temperature elevations and,
              thus, anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Accounting for stress--effect
              relationships enabled us to identify additional drivers of
              heterogeneity including coral taxa, life stage, habitat, food
              availability, climate, and season. These differences can aid reef
              management identifying refuges and conservation priorities, but

              and play a pivotal role in calcium signaling and cellular calcium
              homeostasis. In most organelles, the intraorganellar calcium con-
              centrations rarely exceed micromolar levels. Acidic organelles
              called acidocalcisomes, which concentrate calcium into dense
              phases together with polyphosphates, are an exception. These
              organelles have been identified in diverse organisms, but, to
              date, only in cells that do not form calcium biominerals.
              Recently, a compartment storing molar levels of calcium together
              with phosphorous was discovered in an intracellularly calcifying
              alga, the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi, raising a possible
              connection between calcium storage organelles and calcite
              biomineralization. Here we used cry- oimaging and
              cryospectroscopy techniques to investigate the anat- omy and
              chemical composition of calcium storage organelles in their
              native state and at nanometer-scale resolution. We show that the
              dense calcium phase inside the calcium storage compartment of the
              calcifying coccolithophore Pleurochrysis carterae and the cal-
              cium phase stored in acidocalcisomes of the noncalcifying alga
              Chla- mydomonas reinhardtii have common features. Our
              observations suggest that this strategy for concentrating calcium
              is a widespread trait and has been adapted for coccolith
              formation. The link we describe between acidocalcisomal calcium
              storage and calcium stor- age in coccolithophores implies that
              our physiological and molecu- lar genetic understanding of
              acidocalcisomes could have relevance to the calcium pathway
              underlying coccolithophore calcification, offering a fresh entry

              and automatically synthesizes these data into gene annotations
              having evidence-based quality indices. MAKER is also easily
              trainable: Outputs of preliminary runs are used to automatically
              retrain its gene-prediction algorithm, producing higher-quality
              gene-models on subsequent runs. MAKER's inputs are minimal, and
              its outputs can be used to create a GMOD database. Its outputs
              can also be viewed in the Apollo Genome browser; this feature of
              MAKER provides an easy means to annotate, view, and edit
              individual contigs and BACs without the overhead of a database.
              As proof of principle, we have used MAKER to annotate the genome
              of the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea and to create a new
              genome database, SmedGD. We have also compared MAKER's
              performance to other published annotation pipelines. Our results
              demonstrate that MAKER provides a simple and effective means to
              convert a genome sequence into a community-accessible genome
              database. MAKER should prove especially useful for emerging model

  abstract = "The chemical composition of the oceans and long-term climate
              changes are believed to be linked. Reconstruction of seawater pH
              evolution is desirable as pH may be related to atmospheric pCO2,
              and hence to climate evolution. Boron isotopes in oceanic
              carbonates have been suggested to be a proxy for oceanic paleo-pH
              reconstruction. Nevertheless, the calculation of paleo-pH values
              over geological periods requires a precise knowledge of the boron
              isotopic composition of the oceans when calcite precipitated. We
              present the systematics of boron isotopic composition of the
              world's main rivers. We deduce a continental boron flux to the
              oceans of 38$\times$1010 gB/year with a mean isotopic composition
              of +10‰. These results lead to a balanced boron budget in the
              oceans and allow the development of a model for the marine boron
              secular evolution over the past 100 Myr. It is shown that the
              oceanic boron cycle is mainly controlled by the boron continental
              discharge and the boron uptake from the oceans during low
              temperature alteration of oceanic crust. However, the recent
              important increase of the clastic sediment supply, linked to the
              Himalayan erosion, impacts the oceanic boron budget by enhancing
              significantly the boron uptake by adsorption on sediments. We
              predict a boron isotopic composition in the oceans lower during
              the Cenozoic and slightly higher during the Cretaceous than
              today. The modelled values for the marine boron isotopes follow
              the variations of boron isotopes in carbonates over the Cenozoic
              era provided by previous studies, suggesting that the variations
              of the seawater pH may not have been important on this time
              scale. If this is the case, it involves that buffering mechanisms
              occur in the oceans to maintain seawater pH at a roughly constant

              boron isotope fractionation factor () between the two main
              dissolved boron species, 11B(OH)3 and 10B(OH)−4, has remained
              uncertain. Initially, values were theoretically computed from
              vibrational frequencies of boron species, resulting in a value of
              ‰. Later, spectrophotometric pH measurements on artificial
              seawater suggested a higher value of ‰. A few independent
              theoretical models also pointed to a higher value. Here we
              provide, for the first time, an independent empirical
              fractionation factor (‰), determined by direct measurements of

              global decline due to a variety of causes, one of the major
              causes being widespread coral bleaching events. During bleaching,
              the coral expels its symbiotic algae, thereby losing its main
              source of nutrition generally obtained through photosynthesis.
              While recent coral bleaching events have been extensively
              investigated, there is no scientific data on historical coral
              bleaching prior to 1979. In this study, we employ high-resolution
              femtosecond Laser Ablation Multiple Collector Inductively Coupled

              acidic solutions containing traces of boron are evaporated. Boron
              recoveries have been measured precisely by isotopic dilution and
              boron isotopic ratios have also been determined. Most of the
              evaporations have been conducted at 60‐65 °C. It was found that
              no loss of boric acid occurs when c. 1 $\mu$g of B is evaporated
              in water, HCl, HF and acetone solutions. At the same time, we did
              not observe any associated B isotopic fractionation. In contrast
              to previous studies on B volatilisation, it was not found
              necessary to use mannitol to prevent B losses during the
              evaporation of acidic solutions. Important losses of boron were
              observed from solutions of methanol, ethanol and organic‐rich
              natural solutions. In the presence of methanol and ethanol, a
              volatile methyl (or ethyl) borate is likely to be formed. In
              contrast to these studies, we show that boron is highly volatile
              when the dried residues of an evaporation are heated further. The
              sublimation of boron that then occurs can be moderated by the use
              of mannitol, but a slight increase of the temperature allows B
              volatilisation. Despite the substantial losses of B by
              sublimation, no B isotopic fractionation was observed at 60‐65 C.
              The property of boron to sublime was used to separate B from an
              organic matrix. A miniaturized sublimation apparatus, comprising
              a 5 ml Teflon beaker, and the associated microsublimation
              technique are described. The 100\% boron recovery and the absence

              synoptic surveys. Spectrophotometric pH and total alkalinity
              samples were collected quarterly from 72 sites along the shelf
              for two years. Samples were collected using Niskin bottles
              deployed at 2--3 depths per station (surface, mixed layer, and
              near-bottom) to characterize site extremes in $\Omega$arag
              (highest values near the surface, lowest at depth). $\Omega$arag
              in bottle samples ranged between 3.0 and 0.54 and was strongly
              associated with density; average $\Omega$arag from samples
              collected in the top 10 m was 2.5 compared to an average of 1.1
              in samples below 100 m. The average depth of corrosive waters
              ($\Omega$arag < 1) was interpolated for the shelf from the bottle
              data and was estimated to be an average of 100 m regionally,
              though there were instances when the saturation horizon rose to
              less than 20 m depth, primarily in the northern part of the coast
              during the spring. $\Omega$arag was strongly correlated with
              dissolved inorganic carbon and dissolved oxygen indicating that
              patterns in $\Omega$arag were linked to biological processes. The
              seasonality and spatial patterns we observed on the continental

              concentrations and resulting in decreased water pH and calcium

              biota, but the severity of this threat to ocean ecosystems (and
              humans depending on these ecosystems) is poorly understood. Here
              we evaluate the scale of this threat in the context of widely
              used representative concentration pathways (RCPs) by analysing
              the sensitivities of five animal taxa (corals, echinoderms,

              sensitive to RCP8.5 (936 ppm in 2100) than are crustaceans.
              Larval fishes may be even more sensitive than the lower

              acidification effects, due to the elevated solubility of its
              Mg‐calcite skeleton. This, together with the large
              overexploitation of this species, depicts a bleak future for this
              organism over the next decades. In this study, we evaluated the
              effects of low pH on the species from aquaria experiments.
              Several colonies of C. rubrum were long‐term maintained for 314
              days in aquaria at two different pH levels (8.10 and 7.81, pHT).
              Calcification rate, spicule morphology, major biochemical
              constituents (protein, carbohydrates and lipids) and fatty acids
              composition were measured periodically. Exposure to lower pH
              conditions caused a significant decrease in the skeletal growth
              rate in comparison with the control treatment. Similarly, the
              spicule morphology clearly differed between both treatments at

              severe seawater acidification for 16 d or 30 d, compared to

               zooxanthellae-bearing corals living in shallow-water reef
               environments that experience significant natural variations in
               temperature, light, nutrients and seawater pH, show different
               types of responses. For example, over seasonal time-scales
               Porites corals from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) have a large
               range in pHcf of ~8.3 to ~8.5, significantly greater (~$\times$2
               to ~$\times$3) than that of reef-water (pHT ~8.01 to ~8.08), and
               an order of magnitude greater than that expected from `static'
               laboratory experiments. Strong physiological controls, but of a
               different character, are found in corals grown in a Free Ocean
               Carbon Enrichment Experiment (FOCE) conducted in situ within the
               Heron Island lagoon (GBR). These corals exhibit near constant
               pHcf values regardless of external changes in temperature and
               seawater pH. This pattern of strong physiologically controlled
               `pH-homeostasis', with elevated but constant pHcf has been found
               despite large natural seasonal variations in the pH ($\pm$0.15
               pH units) of the lagoon waters, as well as the even larger
               super-imposed decreases in seawater pH (~0.25 pH units) designed
               to simulate year 2100 conditions. In natural reef environments
               we thus find that the processes influencing the up-regulation of
               pHcf in symbiont-bearing corals are subject to strong
               physiological controls, behaviour that is not well simulated in
               the current generation of aquaria-based experiments with fixed
               seawater pH and temperature. Conversely, cold-water corals that
               lack symbionts and inhabit the relatively stable deep-sea
               environments hold the best prospects for providing reliable
               reconstructions of seawater pH. Clearly, further studies
               utilising the $\delta$11B-pHcf proxy combined with other
               DIC/carbonate-ion proxies (e.g. B/Ca), but conducted under
               realistic `natural' conditions, are required to elucidate the
               processes controlling coral bio-calcification and to better
               understand the vulnerability of scleractinian corals to
               anthropogenic driven warming and ocean acidification.",

              powerful hypothesis‐forming tool that can help elucidate these

              contrasting responses between short‐ (4‐h) and long‐term (5‐day)
              exposures to elevated temperatures. Heat shock proteins were
              up‐regulated only in the short‐term treatment, while the
              long‐term treatment induced the down‐regulation of ribosomal
              proteins and up‐regulation of genes associated with ion transport
              and metabolism (Ca2+ and CO32−). We also profiled responses to
              settlement cues using a natural cue (crustose coralline algae,
              CCA) and a synthetic neuropeptide (GLW‐amide). Both cues resulted
              in metamorphosis, accompanied by differential expression of genes
              with known developmental roles. Some genes were regulated only by
              the natural cue, which may correspond to the
              recruitment‐associated behaviour and morphology changes that
              precede metamorphosis under CCA treatment, but are bypassed under
              GLW‐amide treatment. Validation of these expression profiles

              up‐regulation in one family and down‐regulation in another).
              Future studies of gene expression in corals will have to address

  abstract  = "The boron isotope composition of foraminifera provides a
               powerful tracer for CO2 change over geological time. This proxy
               is based on the equilibrium of boron and its isotopes in
               seawater, which is a function of pH. However while the chemical
               principles underlying this proxy are well understood, its
               reliability has previously been questioned, due to the
               difficulty of boron isotope ($\delta$11B) analysis on
               foraminferal samples and questions regarding calibrations
               between $\delta$11B and pH. This chapter reviews the current
               state of the $\delta$11B-pH proxy in foraminfera, including the
               pioneering studies that established this proxy's potential, and
               the recent work that has improved understanding of boron isotope
               systematics in foraminifera and applied this tracer to the
               geological record. The theoretical background of the
               $\delta$11B-pH proxy is introduced, including an accurate
               formulation of the boron isotope mass balance equations. Sample
               preparation and analysis procedures are then reviewed, with
               discussion of sample cleaning, the potential influence of
               diagenesis, and the strengths and weaknesses of boron
               purification by column chromatography versus microsublimation,
               and analysis by NTIMS versus MC-ICPMS. The systematics of boron
               isotopes in foraminifera are discussed in detail, including
               results from benthic and planktic taxa, and models of boron
               incorporation, fractionation, and biomineralisation. Benthic
               taxa from the deep ocean have $\delta$11B within error of borate
               ion at seawater pH. This is most easily explained by simple
               incorporation of borate ion at the pH of seawater. Planktic
               foraminifera have $\delta$11B close to borate ion, but with
               minor offsets. These may be driven by physiological influences
               on the foraminiferal microenvironment; a novel explanation is
               also suggested for the reduced $\delta$11B-pH sensitivities
               observed in culture, based on variable calcification rates.
               Biomineralisation influences on boron isotopes are then
               explored, addressing the apparently contradictory observations
               that foraminifera manipulate pH during chamber formation yet
               their $\delta$11B appears to record the pH of ambient seawater.
               Potential solutions include the influences of magnesium-removal
               and carbon concentration, and the possibility that pH elevation
               is most pronounced during initial chamber formation under
               favourable environmental conditions. The steps required to
               reconstruct pH and pCO2 from $\delta$11B are then reviewed,
               including the influence of seawater chemistry on boron
               equilibrium, the evolution of seawater $\delta$11B, and the
               influence of second carbonate system parameters on
               $\delta$11B-based reconstructions of pCO2. Applications of
               foraminiferal $\delta$11B to the geological record are

              patterns in 11 reefs of the northern sector of the mesoamerican
              barrier reef system (nsMBRS). Four hundred and seventy four

              throughout a gradient of reef complexity from north to south

              and identified the environmental and spatial variables most
              strongly related to variation in fish and coral species richness
              and composition. We studied variation in fish and coral species
              diversity at two spatial scales: among geomorphology classes
              (reef lagoons, fronts, slopes and terraces) within reefs (beta
              diversity), and among eleven reefs across a 400-km latitudinal
              diversity gradient (delta diversity) in the western Caribbean
              Sea. The variation of species richness and community composition
              was partitioned between environmental and spatial variables.
              Two-way ANOVA (for richness) and MANOVA (for presence-absence

              reefs and geomorphology classes on fish and coral species

              includes the causative agents of human diseases such as malaria
              and toxoplasmosis. Apicomplexans evolved from free-living
              phototrophic ancestors, but how this transition to parasitism
              occurred remains unknown. One potential clue lies in coral reefs,
              of which environmental DNA surveys have uncovered several
              lineages of uncharacterized basally branching apicomplexans1,2.
              Reef-building corals have a well-studied symbiotic relationship
              with photosynthetic Symbiodiniaceae dinoflagellates (for example,
              Symbiodinium3), but the identification of other key microbial
              symbionts of corals has proven to be challenging4,5. Here we use
              community surveys, genomics and microscopy analyses to identify
              an apicomplexan lineage---which we informally name
              `corallicolids'---that was found at a high prevalence (over 80\%
              of samples, 70\% of genera) across all major groups of corals.
              Corallicolids were the second most abundant coral-associated
              microeukaryotes after the Symbiodiniaceae, and are therefore core
              members of the coral microbiome. In situ fluorescence and
              electron microscopy confirmed that corallicolids live
              intracellularly within the tissues of the coral gastric cavity,
              and that they possess apicomplexan ultrastructural features. We
              sequenced the genome of the corallicolid plastid, which lacked
              all genes for photosystem proteins; this indicates that
              corallicolids probably contain a non-photosynthetic plastid (an
              apicoplast6). However, the corallicolid plastid differs from all
              other known apicoplasts because it retains the four ancestral
              genes that are involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis.
              Corallicolids thus share characteristics with both their
              parasitic and their free-living relatives, which suggests that
              they are evolutionary intermediates and implies the existence of
              a unique biochemistry during the transition from phototrophy to
              parasitism.",

              detected in the newly formed regions both at the shell edge, and

              crystalline aragonite. We conclude that the shell of C. acicula

              We also used fluorescence super-resolution imaging to map the

              conditions, and are adapted to these conditions predicted in the

              identifying locally adapted populations, researchers can examine
              the mechanisms used to cope with decreasing pH. One oceanographic
              process that influences pH, is wind driven upwelling. Here we
              compare two Californian populations of the coral Balanophyllia

              physiological and transcriptomic responses to experimental

              scleractinian coral that provides critical three-dimensional
              habitat for many ecologically and economically significant
              species. In this study, four different genotypes of L. pertusa
              were exposed to three pH treatments (pH = 7.60, 7.75, and 7.90)

              (6-month) experimental period. Their physiological response was
              measured as net calcification rate and the activity of carbonic
              anhydrase, a key enzyme in the calcification pathway. In the
              short-term experiment, net calcification rates did not
              significantly change with pH, although they were highly variable
              in the low pH treatment, including some genotypes that maintained
              positive net calcification in undersaturated conditions. In the
              6-month experiment, average net calcification was significantly
              reduced at low pH, with corals exhibiting net dissolution of
              skeleton. However, one of the same genotypes that maintained
              positive net calcification (+0.04\% day−1) under the low pH
              treatment in the short-term experiment also maintained positive
              net calcification longer than the other genotypes in the
              long-term experiment, although none of the corals maintained
              positive calcification for the entire 6 months. Average carbonic
              anhydrase activity was not affected by pH, although some
              genotypes exhibited small, insignificant, increases in activity
              after the sixth month. Our results suggest that while net
              calcification in L. pertusa is adversely affected by ocean
              acidification in the long term, it is possible that some
              genotypes may prove to be more resilient than others,
              particularly to short perturbations of the carbonate system.
              These results provide evidence that populations of L. pertusa in

              was investigated at a high supersaturation, allowing spontaneous
              nucleation and growth, as well as at a low supersaturation
              conditions which allowed only the crystal growth on the
              deliberately introduced aragonite seeds. In either chemical
              systems soluble organic matrix (SOM) extracted from Balanophyllia
              europaea (light sensitive) or Leptopsammia pruvoti (light
              insensitive) was added. The analyses of the kinetic,
              thermodynamic and microscopic data of aragonite precipitation
              showed that at high supersaturation the SOMs increased the
              induction time, did not affect the growth rate and were
              incorporated within aggregates of nanoparticles. At low
              supersaturation, the SOMs affected the aggregation of overgrowing
              crystalline units and did not substantially change the growth
              rate. From these results we can infer that at high
              supersaturation conditions the formation of nanoparticles, which
              is typically observed in the skeleton's early mineralization zone
              may occur, while at low supersaturation the overgrowth on
              prismatic seeds observed in the skeleton fiber zone is a
              predominant process. In conclusion, this research sheds insight
              on coral skeletogenesis bridging physicochemical
              (supersaturation) and biological (role of SOM) models.",

              calcium carbonate skeletons by marine organisms and represents a
              key process in the global carbon cycle. Throughout the geological
              record, this process has evolved repetitively and has altered
              global biogeochemical cycles. Besides the structural variability
              of calcium carbonate polymorphs laid down by different organisms,
              biogenic carbonate skeletons are characterized by the presence of
              organic molecules that are incorporated into the growing

              organic molecules play in the calcification process. In this
              study, we isolated the effect of skeletal organic molecules (SOM)

              fragments by adding extracted SOM or coral mucus (CM) to
              oversaturated calcium carbonate solutions. We found that the

              were present or not. However, the primary polymorph did change
              between the treatments, suggesting that organic molecules
              influence the surface processes that lead to the formation of the
              crystal lattice but not the kinetic processes that transport ions
              to the crystal surface. Since SOM and CM both altered the crystal
              polymorph but not the crystallization rate, we argue that SOM may
              not represent a specialized biomineralization toolkit, but that
              SOM originate from CM and the requirement of the polyp to adhere
              to the substratum.",

              structures that mimic the morphology of the original coral

              coral carbonate and subsequent sea surface temperature (SST)

              Inclusion of as little as 1\% secondary calcite within the
              primary coral aragonite elevates the Sr/Ca-derived SST by 1.2 °C

              on the SST estimated from $\delta$18O (+ 0.6 °C) indicating that

              these observations in the context of skeletal ultra-structural
              organization and composition. Several important observations are
              reported: (1) At all scales of observation, there was a precise
              morphological correspondence between the tissues and the
              skeleton. The morphological features of the calicoblastic
              ectoderm correspond exactly to the shape of individual crystal
              fiber bundles in the underlying skeleton, indicating that the
              calicoblastic cell layer is in direct physical contact with the
              skeletal surface. This is consistent with the previously observed
              chemical and isotopic composition of the ultra-structural
              components in the skeleton. (2) The distribution and density of
              desmocyte cells, which anchor the calicoblastic ectoderm to the
              skeletal surface, vary spatially and temporally during skeletal
              growth. (3) The tissue above the coenosteal spines lack endoderm
              and consists only of ectodermal cell-layers separated by

              expulsion of Ca2+ from the cytosol of all eukaryotic cells and
              are one of the major transport systems involved in long-term
              regulation of resting intracellular Ca2+ concentration. An
              important feature of stony corals, one of the major groups of
              calcifying animals, is the continuous export of large quantities
              of Ca2+ for skeletogenesis. Here, we report the cloning and
              functional expression of the stpPMCA gene from the coral
              Stylophora pistillata, and whose features resemble those of the
              plasma-membrane Ca2+-ATPase family of mammalian cells. This is
              the first known example of a Ca2+-ATPase from the phylum
              Cnidaria, and thus, the most phylogenetically distant PMCA
              sequence in the animal kingdom described to date. We demonstrate
              that the localization of stpPMCA within calicoblastic cells is
              fully coherent with its role in calcification. We also show that
              the coral Ca2+ pump is more closely related to vertebrate PMCAs
              than to Caenorhabditis elegans PMCAs. The cloning of
              evolutionarily conserved genes from cnidarian species repeatedly
              shows that these genes encode similar functional domains.
              Moreover, this high level of gene conservation further validates
              the use of cnidarian model systems for studying processes shared

  abstract = "Ocean acidification poses a serious threat to marine calcifying
              organisms, yet experimental and field studies have found highly
              diverse responses among species and environments. Our
              understanding of the underlying drivers of differential responses
              to ocean acidification is currently limited by difficulties in
              directly observing and quantifying the mechanisms of
              bio‐calcification. Here, we present Raman spectroscopy techniques
              for characterizing the skeletal mineralogy and calcifying fluid
              chemistry of marine calcifying organisms such as corals,
              coralline algae, foraminifera, and fish (carbonate otoliths).
              First, our in vivo Raman technique is the ideal tool for
              investigating non‐classical mineralization pathways. This
              includes calcification by amorphous particle attachment, which
              has recently been controversially suggested as a mechanism by
              which corals resist the negative effects of ocean acidification.
              Second, high‐resolution ex vivo Raman mapping reveals complex
              banding structures in the mineralogy of marine calcifiers, and
              provides a tool to quantify calcification responses to
              environmental variability on various timescales from days to
              years. We describe the new insights into marine bio‐calcification
              that our techniques have already uncovered, and we consider the
              wide range of questions regarding calcifier responses to global
              change that can now be proposed and addressed with these new
              Raman spectroscopy tools.",

  abstract = "Ocean acidification threatens the persistence of biogenic calcium

              achieved by modulating the chemistry of the fluid where
              calcification occurs. We use two novel geochem- ical techniques
              based on boron systematics and Raman spectroscopy, which together
              provide the first constraints on the sensitivity of coral
              calcifying fluid calcium concentrations ([Ca2{\th}]cf) to
              changing seawater pH. In response to simulated end-of-century pH

              much as 25\% above that of seawater and maintained constant

              declined at lower seawater pH. Although the role of [Ca2{\th}]cf

              [Ca2{\th}]cf may be a key mechanism enabling more resist- ant

  abstract = "Poroelasticity is a well-developed theory for the interaction of
              fluid and solid phases of a fluid-saturated porous medium. It is
              widely used in geomechanics and has been applied to bone by many
              authors in the last 30 years. The purpose of this work is, first,
              to review the literature related to the application of
              poroelasticity to the interstitial bone fluid and, second, to
              describe the specific physical and modeling considerations that
              establish poroelasticity as an effective and useful model for
              deformation-driven bone fluid movement in bone tissue. The
              application of poroelasticity to bone differs from its
              application to soft tissues in two important ways. First, the
              deformations of bone are small while those of soft tissues are
              generally large. Second, the bulk modulus of the mineralized bone
              matrix is about six times stiffer than that of the fluid in the
              pores while the bulk moduli of the soft tissue matrix and the
              pore water are almost the same. Poroelasticity and
              electrokinetics can be used to explain strain-generated
              potentials in wet bone. It is noted that strain-generated
              potentials can be used as an effective tool in the experimental
              study of local bone fluid flow, and that the knowledge of this
              technique will contribute to the answers of a number of questions
              concerning bone mineralization, osteocyte nutrition and the bone
              mechanosensory system.",

              mineralization",
  author   = "Crane, Nicole J and Popescu, Victoria and Morris, Michael D and
              Steenhuis, Pieter and Ignelzi, Michael A",
  abstract = "To understand early mineralization events, we studied living
              murine calvarial tissue by Raman spectroscopy using fibroblast
              growth factor 2 (FGF2)-soaked porous beads. We detected increased
              levels of a transient phase resembling octacalcium phosphate in
              sutures undergoing premature suture closure. INTRODUCTION:
              Several calcium phosphates have been postulated as the earliest
              inorganic precursors to bone mineral. They are unstable and have
              not been previously detected in tissue specimens. Whether the
              same intermediates are formed in sutures undergoing premature
              closure is also unknown. METHODS: Six coronal suture tissue
              specimens from fetal day 18.5 B6CBA F1/J wild-type mice were
              studied. Three sutures specimens were treated with FGF2-soaked
              heparin acrylic beads to induce accelerated mineralization and
              premature suture closure. Three control specimens were treated
              with empty heparin acrylic beads. All sutures were maintained as
              organ cultures to permit repeated spectral analyses at 12-24 h
              intervals over a 72-h period. RESULTS: During the first 24 h, the
              spectra contained bands of octacalcium phosphate (OCP) or an
              OCP-like mineral. The main phosphorus-oxygen stretch was at 955
              cm(-1), instead of the 957-959 cm(-1) seen in bone mineral, and
              there was an additional band at 1010-1014 cm(-1), as expected for
              OCP. A broad band was found at 945 cm(-1), characteristic of a
              highly disordered or amorphous calcium phosphate. An increased
              amount of mineral was observed in FGF2-treated sutures, but no
              qualitative differences in Raman spectra were observed between
              experimental and control specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Inorganic
              mineral deposition proceeds through transient intermediates,
              including an OCP-like phase. Although this transient phase has
              been observed in purely inorganic model systems, this study is
              the first to report OCP or an OCP-like intermediate in living
              tissue. Raman microspectroscopy allows observation of this
              transient mineral and may allow observation of other precursors
              as well.",

              using two high-resolution gel electrophoretic techniques.
              Proteins were extracted from bone tissue by extended dialysis
              against 0.5 M EDTA. In some cases, a preextraction was done in
              guanidine HCl. Bovine plasma was also examined to identify the
              proteins in bone that might also be present in blood. We have
              scored 160 major, reproducible spots on our standard preparation
              bone map. These comprise about 40 individual protein groups.
              There are many more minor spots present which puts the total
              number present over 200. Of these groups, 15 are not present on
              plasma maps. Bone proteins identified in this way include actin,
              bone Gla-protein, and osteonectin. The remainder are unknown.
              Bone Gla-protein is present in bovine bone in four isoelectric
              forms, pI=3.95−4.50. Electroblotting analysis of EDTA and

              growing, and adult rats and in the calf and cow, using X-ray
              diffraction and infrared spectroscopy during the thermal
              decomposition of bones and by microassay of carbonate. The
              mineral of all the bone samples, regardless of species or age,
              was found to be a calcium-deficient apatite containing both
              CO3(2-) and HPCO4(2-) ions in the crystal lattice. The crystal
              size, Ca/P molar ratio, and CO3(2-) ion content of cortical bone
              all increased with increasing age in both the rat and the bovine.
              The Ca/P ratio varied from 1.51 in newborn rats to 1.69 in adults
              but remained that of Ca-deficient apatite even though its value
              was close to that of stoichiometric hydroxyapatite (1.67). Both
              the carbonate ion and the hydrogenophosphate ion contents varied
              from one animal species to another and with age within a given
              species. Maturation was correlated with an increase in carbonate
              ion content, which replaced the HPO4(2-) ions. In contrast, the
              calcium ion number per unit formula did not vary during
              maturation. Cortical bone mineral, in both species, regardless of
              age, can therefore be represented by the following formula: Ca8.3
              (PO4)4.3 (CO3)x(HPO4)y(OH)0.3; y decreased and x increased with

              lamellar bone, and it reflects certain aspects of the nature of
              the mineral crystals associated with them. In order to
              investigate the morphology and distribution of apatite crystals
              in woven bone, mineralized collagen fibrils and isolated crystals
              from the mid-diaphyses of human fetal femurs were observed with
              scanning and transmission electron microscopy and high-resolution
              electron microscopy. A number of features of woven bone were
              observed for the first time by these means. Similar to mature
              crystals from lamellar bone, the apatite crystals in woven bone
              are also platelet-shaped. However, most likely because of a high
              rate of old bone resorption and new bone formation in woven
              material, the average crystal dimensions are considerably smaller
              than those of mature crystals in lamellar bone. Apatite crystals
              were noted on the surface of collagen fibrils in woven bone. In
              densely packed woven bone, the periodicity of mineral deposited
              on individual fibrils is in registration over many fibrils. In
              addition to their association with collagen surfaces, crystals
              also appear distributed in both extrafibrillar and intrafibrillar
              collagen regions. In both cases, the minerals are crystalline and
              defect-free. These characteristics provide insight into the
              spatial and temporal relation between collagen and mineral that
              is the basis for the structure and organization of the mineral
              comprising human woven bone.",

              threatened by ocean acidification and warming. Being able to
              project the magnitude of these threats requires an understanding
              of how corals form their carbonate skeletons. Von Euw et al.
              combined ultrahigh-resolution three-dimensional imaging and
              two-dimensional solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance
              spectroscopy to study coral skeletons. They found that mineral
              precipitation in corals is a biologically controlled process
              mediated by organic molecules, rather than an abiotic one that
              depends only on physico-chemical conditions. This has important
              implications for the health of corals in our warmer, higher-CO2
              future. Science, this issue p. 933 Little is known about how
              stony corals build their calcareous skeletons. There are two
              prevailing hypotheses: that it is a physicochemically dominated
              process and that it is a biologically mediated one. Using a
              combination of ultrahigh-resolution three-dimensional imaging and
              two-dimensional solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy, we show that mineral deposition is biologically
              driven. Randomly arranged, amorphous nanoparticles are initially
              deposited in microenvironments enriched in organic material; they
              then aggregate and form ordered aragonitic structures through
              crystal growth by particle attachment. Our NMR results are
              consistent with heterogeneous nucleation of the solid mineral
              phase driven by coral acid-rich proteins. Such a mechanism
              suggests that stony corals may be able to sustain calcification
              even under lower pH conditions that do not favor the inorganic
              precipitation of aragonite. Coral skeletons form by a
              biologically controlled process, rather than abiotically. Coral
              skeletons form by a biologically controlled process, rather than

              weight and has 3 microscopic constituents: (1) filaments of
              lime-boring algae, (2) a dispersed network of fibres 1 µ in
              diameter, and (3) a transparent, milky, regionally birefringent
              matrix of chitin. The chitin was observed to be a spongework of
              fibrils of average diameter 20 mµ. The chitin fibrils were
              inferred to be randomly oriented in the plane of the skeletogenic
              epithelium perpendicular to the direction of growth of the long
              axes of the aragonite crystals. The development of the skeleton
              is traced from the initial mineral deposit by the larva after its
              attachment, through the formation of the larval skeleton and
              growth into the fully formed, branching colony. The process of
              formation of chitin fibrils according to the contour of the
              skeletogenic epithelium and the later deposition of aragonite
              crystals as described accounts for the formation of all skeletal
              elements of Pocillopora. Evidence is presented for the hypotheses
              that (1) the amide group of the chitin molecule is responsible
              for the ability of certain organic substrates to be calcified
              (thus protein is not a necessary component of such substrates);
              (2) zooxanthellae in Pocillopora contribute a product of
              photosynthesis to the coral as the monomer of the chitin matrix;
              and (3) chitin synthesis thus depends on the activity of
              zooxanthellae and the rate of chitin synthesis controls the rate
              of skeletogenesis in Pocillopora.",

              precipitation of calcium carbonate, of the organic matrix from
              scleractinian corals. In fact, it has been well established that
              coral calcification is a biological controlled process
              orchestrated in space and time by the organism also trough the
              secretion of organic matrix molecules because it has been well
              established that coral calcification is a biological controlled
              process, and thus is orchestrated in space and time by the
              organism also through the secretion of organic matrix molecules.
              In this review is presented a scientific path on the
              biomineralization of corals having as focusing point the
              intra-skeletal organic matrix, the molecules that are associated
              with mineral (aragonite). The review starts with a an overview on
              coral tissue, skeleton and tissue skeleton interface, describes
              the intra-skeletal organic matrix putting attention mainly on the
              proteins associated to aragonite and finally describes the in

  abstract = "In corals, biocalcification is a major function that may be
              drastically affected by Ocean Acidification (OA). Scleractinian
              corals grow by building up aragonitic exoskeletons that provide
              support and protection for soft tissues. Although this process
              has been extensively studied, the molecular basis of
              biocalcification is poorly understood. Notably lacking is a
              comprehensive catalogue of the skeleton-occluded proteins - the
              skeletal organic matrix proteins (SOMPs) that are thought to
              regulate the mineral deposition.Using a combination of proteomics
              and transcriptomics, we report the first survey of such proteins
              in the staghorn coral Acropora millepora. The organic matrix
              extracted from the coral skeleton was analyzed by mass
              spectrometry and bioinformatics, enabling the identification of
              36 SOMPs. These results provide novel insights into the molecular
              basis of coral calcification and the macroevolution of metazoan
              calcifying systems, while establishing a platform for studying
              the impact of OA at molecular level. Besides secreted proteins,
              extracellular regions of transmembrane proteins are also present,
              suggesting a close control of aragonite deposition by the
              calicoblastic epithelium. In addition to the expected SOMPs
              (Asp/Glu-rich, galaxins), the skeletal repertoire included
              several proteins containing known extracellular matrix domains.
              From an evolutionary perspective, the number of coral-specific
              proteins is low, many SOMPs having counterparts in the
              non-calcifying cnidarians. Extending the comparison to the
              skeletal organic matrix proteomes of other metazoans allowed the
              identification of a pool of functional domains shared between
              phyla. The data suggest that cooption and domain shuffling may be
              general mechanisms by which the trait of calcification has
              evolved.",

              we performed direct pH imaging at calcification sites

              upregulation in live aposymbiotic primary coral polyps treated

              all individuals using vital staining method while the movement of
              HPTS and Alexa Fluor to SCM suggests that certain ions such as H+
              could diffuse via a paracellular pathway to SCM. Among them, we
              discovered acid-induced oscillations in the pH of SCM (pHSCM),
              observed in 24\% of polyps examined. In addition, we discovered
              acid-induced pH up-regulation waves in 21\% of polyps examined,
              which propagated among SCMs after exposure to acidified seawater.
              Our results showed that corals can regulate pHSCM more
              dynamically than was previously believed. These observations will
              have important implications for determining how corals regulate
              pHSCM during calcification. We propose that corals can sense

              regulate pHSCM using several unknown pH-regulating ion
              transporters that coordinate with multicellular signaling

  abstract = "Symbiotic dinoflagellate algae residing inside coral tissues
              supply the host with the majority of their energy requirements
              through the translocation of photosynthetically fixed carbon. The
              algae, in turn, rely on the host for the supply of inorganic
              carbon. Carbon must be concentrated as CO2 in order for
              photosynthesis to proceed, and here we show that the coral host
              plays an active role in this process. The host-derived symbiosome
              membrane surrounding the algae abundantly expresses vacuolar
              H+-ATPase (VHA), which acidifies the symbiosome space down to pH
              ∼4. Inhibition of VHA results in a significant decrease in
              average H+ activity in the symbiosome of up to 75\% and a
              significant reduction in O2 production rate, a measure of
              photosynthetic activity. These results suggest that host VHA is
              part of a previously unidentified carbon concentrating mechanism
              for algal photosynthesis and provide mechanistic evidence that
              coral host cells can actively modulate the physiology of their
              symbionts.",

              carbonate (ACC) within reservoir organs---gastroliths, readily
              providing the Ca2+ needed to build a new exoskeleton. Despite the

              molecular-level picture of biogenic ACC and its stabilization in
              a bioavailable form, its description has eluded efforts to date.
              Herein, using multinuclear NMR, we accomplish in situ
              molecular-level characterization of ACC within intact gastroliths
              of the crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus. In addition to the known
              CaCO3, chitin scaffold and inorganic phosphate (Pi), we identify
              within the gastrolith two primary metabolites, citrate and
              phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and quantify their abundance by
              applying solution NMR techniques to the gastrolith ``soluble
              matrix.'' The long-standing question on the physico-chemical
              state of ACC stabilizing, P-bearing moieties within the
              gastrolith is answered directly by the application of solid state
              rotational-echo double-resonance (REDOR) and transferred-echo
              double-resonance (TEDOR) NMR to the intact gastroliths: Pi and
              PEP are found molecularly dispersed throughout the ACC as a solid
              solution. Citrate carboxylates are found < 5 {\AA} from a
              phosphate (intermolecular C⋯P distance), an interaction that must
              be mediated by Ca2+. The high abundance and extensive

              which were more closely related to NCXs from vertebrates (NCXA).
              We cloned NCXA from Acropora yongei (AyNCXA), which,

              (Scleractinia, Antipatharia, Octocorallia, Stylasteridae, and
              Milleporidae, two zoanthids, and three calcified hydractiniids)

              deeper than 50 m, i.e., deep water as defined in this paper.
              Although the number of newly described species of deep-water
              scleractinian corals appears to be increasing at an exponential
              rate, it is suggested that this rate will plateau in the near
              future. The majority of azooxanthellate Scleractinia is solitary
              in form, firmly attached to a substrate, most abundant at
              200--1000 m, and consist of caryophylliids. Literature helpful
              for the identification of deep-water Scleractinia is listed

              northwest Indian Ocean, and is remarkably similar to high
              diversity regions for shallow-water zooxanthellate Scleractinia.
              As suggested for shallow-water corals, the cause for the high
              diversity of deep-water scleractinian diversity is thought to be
              the result of the availability of large contiguous stable
              substrate, in the case of deep-water corals at depths of
              200--1000 m (the area effect), whereas regions of low

              the nature of the initial calcium carbonate skeleton deposited by
              newly settling coral recruits. Settling Acropora millepora larvae
              were sampled daily for 10 days from initial attachment, and the
              carbonate mineralogy of their newly deposited skeletons was
              investigated. Bulk analyses using Raman and infrared
              spectroscopic methods revealed that the skeletons were
              predominantly comprised of aragonite, with no evidence of calcite
              or an amorphous precursor phase, although presence of the latter
              cannot be discounted. Sensitive selected area electron
              diffraction analyses of sub-micron areas of skeletal regions

              indicating that skeletons of new coral recruits share the same

              septa of several color morphs of the coral Galaxea fascicularis
              was investigated over a 24-h period. Results suggest that
              nanocrystals, on denticles at the apices of exsert septa, may be
              the surface manifestation of centers of calcification. These
              crystals were also found on the septa of the axial corallite of
              Acropora formosa. The deposition of nanocrystals appears to be
              independent of diurnal rhythms. Internally and proximal to the
              septal apices, distinct clusters of polycrystalline fibers
              originate from centers of calcification and form fanlike
              fascicles. Upon these fascicles, acicular crystals grow and
              extend to form the visible fasciculi at the skeletal surface.
              Deposition of aragonitic fusiform crystals in both G.
              fascicularis and A. formosa occurs without diurnal rhythm.
              Nucleation of fusiform crystals appears to be independent of
              centers of calcification and may occur by secondary nucleation.
              Formation of semi-solid masses by fusiform crystals suggests that
              the crystals may play a structural role in septal extension.
              Lamellar crystals, which have not been reported as a component of

              calcification provides a unique opportunity to study the
              bio-calcium carbonate formation mechanism involving skeleton
              morphological changes. Here we investigate the mineral formation
              of primary polyps, just after settlement, in two taxa of the
              pocilloporoid corals: Stylophora pistillata (Esper, 1797) and
              Pocillopora acuta (Lamarck, 1816). We show that the initial
              mineral phase is nascent Mg-Calcite, with rod-like morphology in
              P. acuta, and dumbbell morphology in S. pistillata. These
              structures constitute the first layer of the basal plate which is
              comparable to Rapid Accretion Deposits (Centers of Calcification,
              CoC) in adult coral skeleton. We found also that the
              rod-like/dumbbell Mg-Calcite structures in subsequent growth step
              may merge into larger aggregates by deposition of aragonite
              needles. Our results suggest that a biologically controlled
              mineralization of initial skeletal deposits (CoC) occurs in three
              steps: first, vesicles filled with divalent ions are formed
              intracellularly. These vesicles are then transferred to the
              calcification site, forming nascent Mg-Calcite rod/pristine
              dumbbell structures. During the third step, aragonite crystals
              may develop between these structures forming spherulite-like
              aggregates. Statement of Significance Coral settlement and
              recruitment periods are highly sensitive to environmental
              conditions. Successful mineralization during these periods is
              vital and influences the coral's chances of survival. Therefore,
              understanding the exact mechanism underlying carbonate
              precipitation is highly important. Here, we used in vivo
              microscopy, spectroscopy and molecular methods to provide new
              insights into mineral development. We show that the primary
              polyp's mineral arsenal consists of two types of minerals:
              Mg-Calcite and aragonite. In addition, we provide new insights
              into the ion pathway by showing that divalent ions are
              concentrated in intracellular vesicles and are eventually

              as `organic matrix', and the transport of ions (calcium,
              bicarbonates and protons in the case of calcification) to the
              mineralising site. This review shows a view of the works carried
              out on biomineralisation in scleractinian corals, including some
              aspects on the control of calcification by environmental
              parameters. It also gives insights into the biological basis of
              the use of coral skeletons as environmental archives in
              palaeo-oceanography. To cite this article: D. Allemand et al., C.

              and scanning electron microscopy. Both species contain similar
              shell ultrastructures. We show that larval shells contain
              amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), in addition to aragonite. The
              aragonite is much less crystalline than nonbiogenic aragonite. We
              further show that the initially deposited mineral phase is
              predominantly ACC that subsequently partially transforms into
              aragonite. The postset juvenile shell, as well as the adult shell
              of Mercenaria also contains aragonite that is less crystalline

              important function in mollusc larval shell formation. It is

              Entrance, BC, and the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary,
              Washington State. SEM imaging of S. campylecus revealed the

              remineralization. Profiles of Na/Ca, Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca
              could, however, be obtained with Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry.
              Sr/Ca values were observed to display two maxima over distances
              covering approximately 12 growth bands, with corresponding minima
              in Mg/Ca and Na/Ca. These cyclical co-variations were interpreted
              to be primarily influenced by surface water productivity. This
              cyclicity in the trace element profiles, in the context of a
              documented biannual increase in productivity, suggested that the
              growth bands are monthly. -- The average radial growth rate of S.
              campylecus was 1.4 $\pm$ 0.1 mm.yr⁻¹, and the average axial
              growth rate was 17.3 $\pm$ 1.1 mm.yr⁻¹. Temperature changes
              cannot account for the variation in Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca in either S.
              campylecus or P. pacifica. These variations appear instead to be
              modulated by surface water productivity. The annual radial growth
              rate of P. pacifica varied between 0.23 and 0.58 mm.yr⁻¹ in the
              samples studied - considerably higher than growth rates of a
              similar species in the North Atlantic. Geographic variation in

  abstract = "SYNOPSIS. Photosynthesis and calcification in zooxanthellate
              scleractinian corals and coral reefs are reviewed at several
              scales: cellular (pathways and transport mechanisms of inorganic
              carbon and calcium), organismal (interaction between
              photosynthesis and calcification, effect of light) and
              ecosystemic (community primary production and calcification, and
              air-sea CO2 exchanges).The coral host plays a major role in
              supplying carbon for the photosynthesis by the algal symbionts
              through a system similar to the carbon-concentrating mechanism
              described in free living algal cells. The details of carbon
              supply to the calcification process are almost unknown, but
              metabolic CO2 seems to be a significant source. Calcium supply
              for calcification is diffusional through oral layers, and active
              membrane transport only occurs between the calicoblastic cells
              and the site of calcification. Photosynthesis and calcification
              are tightly coupled in zooxanthellate scleractinian corals and
              coral reef communities. Calcification is, on average, three times
              higher in light than in darkness. The recent suggestion that
              calcification is dark-repressed rather than light-enhanced is not
              supported by the literature. There is a very strong correlation
              between photosynthesis and calcification at both the organism and
              community levels, but the ratios of calcification to gross
              photosynthesis (0.6 in corals and 0.2 in reef communities) differ
              from unity, and from each other as a function of level.The
              potential effect of global climatic changes (pCO2 and
              temperature) on the rate of calcification is also reviewed. In
              various calcifying photosynthetic organisms and communities, the
              rate of calcification decreases as a function of increasing pCO2
              and decreasing calcium carbonate saturation state. The calculated
              decrease in CaCO3, production, estimated using the scenarios
              considered by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),
              is 10\% between 1880 and 1990, and 9--30\% (mid estimate: 22\%)
              from 1990 to 2100. Inadequate understanding of the mechanism of
              calcification and its interaction with photosynthesis severely
              limits the ability to provide an accurate prediction of future
              changes in the rate of calcification.",

              pistillata, aims at providing new information on the
              `light-enhanced calcification' process. In a first step, in
              controlled conditions of culture and constant light supply, we
              studied the diurnal cycle of calcification. We determined that
              calcification rates are constant during the day and the night
              with a 2.6-fold difference between day and night calcification
              rates. We also showed that the photosynthetic rate is constant
              throughout the day when a constant light intensity is applied.
              Our results on free-running experiments in prolonged conditions
              of light or dark suggest that calcification is not regulated by
              an endogenous circadian rhythm. In a second step, using a kinetic
              isotopic approach with 45Ca, we characterized the transition
              stages between day and night and vice versa. Under our
              experimental conditions, the lag-phase necessary to switch from
              the light to the dark calcification rate is the same as the
              lag-phase necessary to switch from the dark to the light
              calcification rate. We discuss our results in the context of two
              hypotheses of the light-enhanced calcification process: (1) the
              role of photosynthesis on the pH in the coelenteron and (2) the

              million years ago, with intense volcanism and extraterrestrial
              impact the most widely supported hypotheses. However, without
              empirical evidence for either's exact environmental effects, it
              is difficult to discern which was most important in driving
              extinction. It is also unclear why recovery of biodiversity and
              carbon cycling in the oceans was so slow after an apparently
              sudden extinction event. In this paper, we show (using boron
              isotopes and Earth system modeling) that the impact caused rapid
              ocean acidification, and that the resulting ecological collapse
              in the oceans had long-lasting effects for global carbon cycling
              and climate. Our data suggest that impact, not volcanism, was key
              in driving end-Cretaceous mass extinction.Mass extinction at the
              Cretaceous--Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary coincides with the
              Chicxulub bolide impact and also falls within the broader time
              frame of Deccan trap emplacement. Critically, though, empirical
              evidence as to how either of these factors could have driven
              observed extinction patterns and carbon cycle perturbations is
              still lacking. Here, using boron isotopes in foraminifera, we
              document a geologically rapid surface-ocean pH drop following the
              Chicxulub impact, supporting impact-induced ocean acidification
              as a mechanism for ecological collapse in the marine realm.
              Subsequently, surface water pH rebounded sharply with the
              extinction of marine calcifiers and the associated imbalance in
              the global carbon cycle. Our reconstructed water-column pH
              gradients, combined with Earth system modeling, indicate that a
              partial ∼50\% reduction in global marine primary productivity is
              sufficient to explain observed marine carbon isotope patterns at
              the K-Pg, due to the underlying action of the solubility pump.
              While primary productivity recovered within a few tens of
              thousands of years, inefficiency in carbon export to the deep sea
              lasted much longer. This phased recovery scenario reconciles
              competing hypotheses previously put forward to explain the K-Pg
              carbon isotope records, and explains both spatially variable
              patterns of change in marine productivity across the event and a
              lack of extinction at the deep sea floor. In sum, we provide
              insights into the drivers of the last mass extinction, the
              recovery of marine carbon cycling in a postextinction world, and
              the way in which marine life imprints its isotopic signal onto
              the geological record.",

              were studied by using 45Ca as a tracer. The biological model used
              was clones of Stylophora pistillata developed into microcolonies
              whose skeleton is entirely covered by tissues, thus avoiding
              direct radioisotope exchange between the sea water and the
              skeleton. The study of Ca2+ compartments was performed by
              measuring two complementary parameters: Ca2+ influx and Ca2+
              efflux kinetics. Kinetic analysis of 45Ca uptake revealed three
              exchangeable and one non-exchangeable Ca2+ compartments in these
              microcolonies. The first compartment was saturable with a short
              half-time (4 min), correlated to external Ca2+ concentration and
              insensitive to metabolic or ion transport inhibitors. This
              compartment (72.88 nmol Ca2+ mg-1 protein) has been previously
              attributed to sea water present in the coelenteron. The second
              Ca2+ compartment (7.12 nmol Ca2+ mg-1 protein) was soluble in
              NaOH, saturable with a half-time of 20 min and displayed a
              combination of Michaelis-Menten kinetics and diffusional entry.
              It was insensitive to a variety of inhibitors but its loading was
              stimulated by Ca2+ channel inhibitors. On the basis of uptake
              experiments, the existence of a third compartment with a rapid
              turnover rate (about 2 min) and a very small size is predicted.
              It is suggested that this compartment corresponds to the
              calicoblastic epithelium. Ca2+ flux through this compartment was
              facilitated by voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (with L-type
              characteristics) and Ca2+-ATPase and was coupled to an anion
              carrier. Transcellular Ca2+ movement was dependent on the
              cytoskeleton. The rate of Ca2+ flux across this epithelium was
              about 975 pmol mg-1 protein min-1. The fourth calcium
              compartment, corresponding to the skeleton, was soluble in HCl
              and non-exchangeable. After a short lag phase (about 2 min), the
              rate of Ca2+ deposition was linear over a period of at least 5 h.
              The calcification rate was 975 pmol mg-1 protein h-1 at an
              irradiance of 175 µmol photons m-2 s-1. It followed
              Michaelis-Menten kinetics and saturated at levels (9 mmol l-1)
              close to the Ca2+ concentration of sea water. Wash-out (efflux)
              experiments employing several different protocols allowed
              identification of six compartments. The first two compartments
              were extracellular (bulk extracolonial water and coelenteron).
              The third compartment may be part of the second Ca2+ compartment
              identified by influx experiments. A fourth compartment was
              sensitive to the Ca2+ channel inhibitor D600 and appeared to be
              associated with the NaOH-soluble (tissue) Ca2+ pool. Two
              compartments were identified during skeletal efflux, the first
              being small and due to either tissue carry-over or a labile
              skeletal compartment. The second compartment corresponded to bulk
              skeletal deposition. The various efflux protocols produced
              varying estimates of tissue Ca2+ levels and calcification rates
              and, thus, coral post-incubation processing has a profound impact
              on experimental interpretation.",

  abstract = "The kinetics of organic matrix biosynthesis and incorporation
              into scleractinian coral skeleton was studied using microcolonies
              of Stylophora pistillata. [14C]Aspartic acid was used to label
              the organic matrix since this acidic amino acid can represent up
              to 50 mol \% of organic matrix proteins. External aspartate was
              rapidly incorporated into tissue protein without any detectable
              lag phase, suggesting either a small intracellular pool of
              aspartic acid or a pool with a fast turn-over rate. The
              incorporation of 14C-labelled macromolecules into the skeleton
              was linear over time, after an initial delay of 20 min. Rates of
              calcification, measured by the incorporation of 45Ca into the
              skeleton, and of organic matrix biosynthesis and incorporation
              into the skeleton were constant. Inhibition of calcification by
              the Ca2+ channel inhibitor verapamil reduced the incorporation of
              organic matrix proteins into the skeleton. Similarly, organic
              matrix incorporation into the skeleton, but not protein synthesis
              for incorporation into the tissue compartment, was dependent on
              the state of polymerization of both actin and tubulin, as shown
              by the sensitivity of this process to cytochalasin B and
              colchicin. These drugs may inhibit exocytosis of organic matrix
              proteins into the subcalicoblastic space. Finally, inhibition of
              protein synthesis by emetin or cycloheximide and inhibition of
              N-glycosylation by tunicamycin reduced both the incorporation of
              macromolecules into the skeleton and the rate of calcification.
              This suggests that organic matrix biosynthesis and its migration
              towards the site of calcification may be a prerequisite step in
              the calcification process. On the basis of these results, we
              investigated the effects of tributyltin (TBT), a component of
              antifouling painting known to interfere with biomineralization
              processes. Our results have shown that this xenobiotic
              significantly inhibits protein synthesis and the subsequent
              incorporation of protein into coral skeleton. This effect was
              correlated with a reduction in the rate of calcification. Protein
              synthesis was shown to be the parameter most sensitive to TBT
              (IC50=0.2 micromol l-1), followed by aspartic acid uptake by
              coral tissue (IC50=0.6 micromol l-1), skeletogenesis (IC50=3
              micromol l-1) and Ca2+ uptake by coral tissue (IC50=20 micromol
              l-1). These results suggest that the mode of action of TBT on
              calcification may be the inhibition of organic matrix
              biosynthesis.",

  abstract = "Reef-building corals are very sensitive to changes in their
              environment and have been identified as potential accurate
              recorders of environmental changes. They form aragonitic
              carbonate skeletons that contain relatively high amounts of
              strontium (Sr[2+]). The ratio of Sr[2+]/calcium (Ca[2+]) has been
              proved to be useful for paleoclimatic studies since it has been
              suggested to vary with the seawater temperature. However, no
              correlation can be established between skeletal Sr[2+] content
              and environmental parameters due to the lack of knowledge
              concerning the extent to which skeletal chemistry is controlled
              by physiological parameters. In this study, we investigated the
              pathway of Sr[2+] incorporation by the scleractinian coral
              Stylophora pistillata. For this purpose, we used [85]Sr and a
              non-destructive NaI $\gamma$ detector. Sr[2+] skeletal
              incorporation was found to be linear during the 9 experimental
              days of incubation with natural concentrations of Sr[2+]. The
              incorporation of Sr[2+] versus external Sr[2+] concentration was
              also linear up to 3.42 mM (i.e. a concentration 37.5 times higher
              than normal seawater concentration). However, the uptake of
              Sr[2+] at high concentrations (>1 mM) decreased with an increase
              in Ca[2+] concentration in the seawater. Moreover, Verapamil, a
              Ca[2+] channel inhibitor, also inhibits the incorporation of
              Sr[2+] with the same I[c50] (12 $\mu$M) as for Ca[2+].
              Incorporation of Sr[2+] is therefore inversely correlated to the
              rate of calcification, suggesting interactions between these 2
              ions, which should be taken into account during paleoclimatic
              studies.",

              and less than 5\% of an organic matrix consisting mostly of
              proteins, glycoproteins and polysaccharides. Previous studies
              have elucidated the biological activities of the shell matrices
              from bivalve molluscs on skin, especially on the expression of
              the extracellular matrix components of fibroblasts. In this work,
              we have investigated the potential biological activities of shell
              matrix components extracted from the shell of the scallop Pecten
              maximus on human fibroblasts in primary culture. Firstly, we
              demonstrated that shell matrix components had different effects
              on general cellular activities. Secondly, we have shown that the
              shell matrix components stimulate the synthesis of type I and III
              collagens, as well as that of sulphated GAGs. The increased
              expression of type I collagen is likely mediated by the
              recruitment of transactivating factors (Sp1, Sp3 and human
              c-Krox) in the −112/−61 bp COL1A1 promoter region. Finally,
              contrarily to what was obtained in previous works, we
              demonstrated that the scallop shell extracts have only a small
              effect on cell migration during in vitro wound tests and have no
              effect on cell proliferation. Thus, our research emphasizes the

              matrix",
  author   = "Mann, Karlheinz and Poustka, Albert and Mann, Matthias",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND:The organic matrix contained in biominerals plays an
              important role in regulating mineralization and in determining
              biomineral properties. However, most components of biomineral
              matrices remain unknown at present. In sea urchin tooth, which is
              an important model for developmental biology and
              biomineralization, only few matrix components have been
              identified. The recent publication of the Strongylocentrotus
              purpuratus genome sequence rendered possible not only the
              identification of genes potentially coding for matrix proteins,
              but also the direct identification of proteins contained in
              matrices of skeletal elements by in-depth, high-accuracy
              proteomic analysis.RESULTS:We identified 138 proteins in the
              matrix of tooth powder. Only 56 of these proteins were previously
              identified in the matrices of test (shell) and spine. Among the
              novel components was an interesting group of five proteins
              containing alanine- and proline-rich neutral or basic motifs
              separated by acidic glycine-rich motifs. In addition, four of the
              five proteins contained either one or two predicted Kazal
              protease inhibitor domains. The major components of tooth matrix
              were however largely identical to the set of spicule matrix
              proteins and MSP130-related proteins identified in test (shell)
              and spine matrix. Comparison of the matrices of crushed teeth to
              intact teeth revealed a marked dilution of known intracrystalline
              matrix proteins and a concomitant increase in some intracellular
              proteins.CONCLUSION:This report presents the most comprehensive
              list of sea urchin tooth matrix proteins available at present.
              The complex mixture of proteins identified may reflect many
              different aspects of the mineralization process. A comparison
              between intact tooth matrix, presumably containing odontoblast
              remnants, and crushed tooth matrix served to differentiate
              between matrix components and possible contributions of cellular
              remnants. Because LC-MS/MS-based methods directly measures
              peptides our results validate many predicted genes and confirm
              the existence of the corresponding proteins. Knowledge of the
              components of this model system may stimulate further experiments
              aiming at the elucidation of structure, function, and interaction
              of biomineral matrix components.",

  abstract = "To construct calcium carbonate skeletons of sophisticated
              architecture, scleractinian corals secrete an extracellular
              skeletal organic matrix (SOM) from aboral ectodermal cells. The
              SOM, which is composed of proteins, saccharides, and lipids,
              performs functions critical for skeleton formation. Even though
              polysaccharides constitute the major component of the SOM, its
              contribution to coral skeleton formation is poorly understood. To
              this end, we analyzed the SOM of the massive colonial coral,
              Porites australiensis, the skeleton of which has drawn great
              research interest because it records environmental conditions
              throughout the life of the colony. The coral skeleton was
              extensively cleaned, decalcified with acetic acid, and organic
              fractions were separated based on solubility. These fractions
              were analyzed using various techniques, including SDS-PAGE,
              FT-IR, in vitro crystallization, CHNS analysis, chromatography
              analysis of monosaccharide and enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA).
              We confirmed the acidic nature of SOM and the presence of
              sulphate, which is thought to initiate CaCO3 crystallization. In
              order to analyze glycan structures, we performed ELLA on the
              soluble SOM for the first time and found that it exhibits strong
              specificity to Datura stramonium lectin (DSL). Furthermore, using
              biotinylated DSL with anti-biotin antibody conjugated to
              nanogold, in situ localization of DSL-binding polysaccharides in
              the P. australiensis skeleton was performed. Signals were
              distributed on the surfaces of fiber-like crystals of the
              skeleton, suggesting that polysaccharides may modulate crystal
              shape. Our study emphasizes the importance of sugar moieties in
              biomineralization of scleractinian corals.",

              of atmospheric CO2 worldwide. Hence, understanding coral

              evaluating and predicting the effect of environmental factors on

              on adult corals, the exact stage at which corals initiate
              mineralization remains enigmatic. Here, we show that minerals are

              evolve into the more mature aragonitic fibers characteristic of
              the stony coral skeleton. The process is accompanied by
              modulation of proteins and ions within these minerals. These

              determination of the boron isotopic composition (11B/10B) of
              carbonate and water samples using a mineral acid matrix and
              HR-ICP-MS. Our method for $\delta$11B determination utilizes a
              micro-distillation based boron purification technique for both
              carbonate and seawater matrices. The micro-distillation method is
              characterized by low blank (⩽0.01 ng-B) and 99.8 $\pm$ 5.7\%
              boron recovery. We also report a new ICP-MS method, performed in
              a hydrofluoric acid matrix, using a jet interface fitted
              Thermo\textregistered{} Element XR that consumes <3.0 ng-B per
              quintuplicate analyses ($\pm$0.5‰, 2$\sigma$, n = 5). A
              comparatively high matrix tolerance limit of ⩽50 ppb Na/K/Mg/Ca
              characterizes our ICP-MS method. With an extremely low procedural
              blank (⩽0.05 $\pm$ 0.01 ng-B) the present isotope method is
              optimized for rapid (∼25 samples per session) analysis of small
              masses of carbonates (foraminifera, corals) with low boron
              abundance and small volume water samples (seawater, porewater,
              river water). Our $\delta$11B estimates of seawater (39.8 $\pm$
              0.5‰, 2$\sigma$, n = 30); SRM AE-120 (−20.2 $\pm$ 0.5‰, 2s, n =

              $\pm$ 0.5‰, 2s, n = 16) are within analytical uncertainty of
              published values. We apply this new method to assess the impacts

              application of mass spectrometry-based approaches to the study of
              ancient proteomes. As with palaeogenomics (the study of ancient
              DNA), it intersects evolutionary biology, archaeol- ogy and
              anthropology, with applications ranging from the phylogenetic
              reconstruction of extinct species to the investigation of past
              human diets and ancient diseases. However, there is no explicit
              consensus at present regarding standards for data report- ing,
              data validation measures or the use of suitable contamination
              controls in ancient protein studies. Additionally, in contrast to
              the ancient DNA community, no consolidated guidelines have been
              proposed by which researchers, reviewers and editors can evaluate
              palaeoproteomics data, in part due to the novelty of the field.
              Here we present a series of precautions and standards for ancient
              protein research that can be implemented at each stage of
              analysis, from sample selection to data interpretation. These
              guidelines are not intended to impose a narrow or rigid list of
              authentication criteria, but rather to support good practices in
              the field and to ensure the generation of robust, reproducible
              results. As the field grows and methodologies change, so too will
              best practices. It is therefore essential that researchers
              continue to provide necessary details on how data were generated
              and authenticated so that the results can be independently and
              effectively evaluated. We hope that these proposed standards of
              practice will help to provide a firm foundation for the
              establishment of palaeoproteomics as a viable and powerful tool
              for archaeologists, anthropologists and evolutionary biologists.",

  abstract = "Many organisms incorporate inorganic solids in their tissues to
              enhance their functional, primarily mechanical, properties. These
              mineralized tissues, also called biominerals, are unique
              organo-mineral nanocomposites, organized at several hierarchical
              levels, from nano- to macroscale. Unlike man-made composite
              materials, which often are simple physical blends of their
              components, the organic and inorganic phases in biominerals
              interface at the molecular level. Although these tissues are made
              of relatively weak components under ambient conditions, their
              hierarchical structural organization and intimate interactions
              between different elements lead to superior mechanical
              properties. Understanding basic principles of formation,
              structure, and functional properties of these tissues might lead
              to novel bioinspired strategies for material design and better
              treatments for diseases of the mineralized tissues. This review
              focuses on general principles of structural organization,
              formation, and functional properties of biominerals on the
              example the bone tissues. WIREs Nanomed Nanobiotechnol 2011 3

              with mollusk shell prismatic layer, on the precipitation of
              CaCO3in vitro. We show that Asprich induces and transiently

              Asprich also induces the formation of ACC when adsorbed onto
              chitin, a major component of the intracrystalline organic matrix
              of the prismatic layer. Based on this evidence, combined with
              previous studies on the forming prisms in the shell layer, we
              suggest that the in vivo function of Asprich is inducing and
              stabilizing ACC particles and inhibiting their uncontrolled

  abstract = "The morphology of branching corals effectively blocks impinging
              currents. Weak flows in the colony's inner sections can hinder
              some of the corals' basic physiological functions. At night, high
              respiration by the coral and the absence of photosynthesis by the
              symbiotic algae sometimes generate severe hypoxia near coral
              branches. Nevertheless, branching corals thrive in flow-protected
              areas. Many of them host resident fish that seek shelter between
              their branches during the night. In situ observations using an
              infrared-sensitive video camera revealed that, unlike
              crevice-dwelling fishes, which sleep motionless, fish (Dascyllus
              marginatus, D. aruanus, and Chromis viridis) that spend the night
              in living hard corals (Stylophora pistillata, Acropora spp.,
              Pocillopora spp., and Seriatopora spp.) exhibit a unique
              sleep-swimming mode that is characterized by energetic,
              high-frequency fin motions. In the reef, the presence of fish in
              the coral S. pistillata increased gypsum dissolution and, hence,
              mass transfer, by ~17\% compared with colonies without fish. The
              extent to which the fish enhanced water replenishment in the
              inner zone of the coral was assessed in the laboratory using
              oxygen measurements. In the absence of fish, oxygen levels near
              the coral tissues (~1 mm) rapidly declined, reaching 10--30\% of
              ambient levels, which was much lower than the nearly steady
              levels of 60--80\% when sleep-swimming fish were present.
              Individual sleep-swimming fish were spatially separated across
              the coral, so that most of the coral's inner zone was frequently
              ventilated. This common, yet so-far overlooked mutualistic
              relationship is unique by the virtue of its effect, the active
              modulation of hydrodynamic conditions, and its operation during
              the sleep of the active animal. The modulation of hydrodynamic
              conditions by the fish can mitigate flow limitation on the growth
              and survival of branching corals.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Currently, little is known about the progression of an
              immune response against SARSCoV- 2 upon infection or
              sub-infection-exposure over time. We examined the serologic
              response in healthcare workers up to 12 weeks after a
              well-documented and contained outbreak and compared results with
              findings from earlier serologic testing in the same population.
              METHODS: This study followed 166 health care workers of the
              University Perinatal Care Center, Regensburg, Germany, for up to
              12 weeks. 27 of the subjects had previously tested positive for
              the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR testing and developed COVID-19.
              Serologic responses were tested with two independent commercially
              available test kits. RESULTS: 77.8 \% of COVID-19 study subjects
              developed a specific IgG-response over the course of the 12-week
              study, while none of the COVID-19 contact groups had a detectable
              IgG response. Amongst most COVID-19 patients the values of
              detectable IgG-responses significantly increased over time as
              confirmed with both tests, while that of positive IgA responses
              decreased. Between the number of reported symptoms and antibody
              responses in COVID-19 patients no correlation was found and no
              new cases of seroconversion were identified in asymptomatic
              coworkers with negative PCR during the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS:
              Immune response after COVID-19 increases significantly over time
              but still approximately 22 \% of COVID-19 patients did not mount
              a measurable serologic immune response within 60 days. Exposed
              co-workers did not develop any relevant antibody levels at all.
              We conclude that immunity after infection increases over time,
              but the antibody response does not develop reliably in all
              infected people.",
